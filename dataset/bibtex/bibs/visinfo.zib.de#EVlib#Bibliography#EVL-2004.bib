                 role in performing efficient collision handling. Many
                 different geometric primitives have been used to
                 construct these representations, which allow areas of
                 interaction to be localized quickly. For time-critical
                 algorithms, there are distinct advantages to using
                 hierarchies of spheres, known as sphere-trees, for
                 object representation. This article presents a novel
                 algorithm for the construction of sphere-trees. The
                 algorithm presented approximates objects, both convex
                 and non-convex, with a higher degree of fit than
                 existing algorithms. In the lower levels of the
                 representations, there is almost an order of magnitude

                 the objects to a given accuracy.",

                 Higher details are often traded or sacrificed for speed
                 in order to maintain the simulation at reasonable
                 rates. This article proposes a technique to dynamically
                 adjust the level of detail of cloth meshes. Mesh
                 quality, during successive subdivision/simplification
                 operations, is guaranteed by the subdivision scheme
                 adopted. Also, topology of the meshes used in our work
                 exhibits unique features making it attractive in the
                 context of a gradual level of detail variation.
                 Subdivision is triggered by geometric criteria based on
                 estimated surface curvature, evaluated locally.
                 Simplification is started in cloth regions where
                 surface curvature is considered small enough. The
                 choice of a subdivision scheme should avoid
                 introducing, at all costs, discontinuities on the
                 equations governing the simulation. However, reducing
                 the level of detail inevitably leads to such
                 discontinuous scenarios. Our original contribution,
                 with this work, provides a set of techniques that
                 allows us to overcome the numeric instability problems

                 In a complex scene containing a high number of

                 models currently adopted in CAD environments. Up to
                 now, designers and engineers have mainly access either
                 to indirect manipulations of free form surfaces using
                 their control network or to low-level deformation
                 functions at prescribed points and along a line on a
                 surface. Based on a study of designers? activity, a
                 free form deformation feature approach is proposed to
                 create CAD tools that better fit their way of working.
                 The proposed category of features aims at enforcing the
                 visual effect of the so-called character lines,
                 extensively used by designers to specify the shape of
                 an object. For this reason, in the proposed approach 3D
                 lines are used to drive surface deformation over
                 specified areas. One type of these features is based on
                 G0 or G1 discontinuities along the character lines.
                 Traditionally, a designer using a CAD system creates
                 these features by generating several patches. Our
                 approach proposes a method to create discontinuities on
                 a single patch, using the trimming properties of the
                 surface. Examples are provided and analysed using
                 curvature maps to address the quality issue of the

                 extendable templates. By the advantage of the small
                 number of intrinsic parameters in the feature based
                 deformable templates, fitting procedures are faster and
                 more robust. Three key types of simple freeform
                 templates, the bump, the ridge and the hole, are
                 introduced first. With distance measuring methods, a
                 uniform optimization function is presented to achieve
                 automatic feature recognition and fitting. By
                 introducing the extendable template, the hole and the
                 ridge template are further developed to match complex
                 freeform shapes. Based on the approximated template,
                 further shape manipulations can be conducted
                 effectively using the shape intrinsic parameters.
                 Numerical experiments are conducted in order to verify
                 the proposed algorithms. It is also described how the
                 matching technique can be applied in computer graphics
                 and computer-aided design applications.",

                 on an avatar, a 3D graphical model of the customer.
                 However the normal technique for modeling clothing in
                 computer graphics, cloth dynamics, suffers from being
                 too processor intensive and is not practical for real
                 time applications. Hence, retailers normally rely on a
                 fixed set of body models to which clothes are
                 pre-fitted. As the customer has to choose from this
                 limited set the fit is typicallly not very

                 effective and accurate flow visualization techniques.
                 Animation allows us to depict direction, orientation,
                 and velocity of a vector field accurately. This paper
                 extends a former proposal for a new approach to produce
                 perfectly cyclic and variable-speed animations for 2D
                 steady vector fields (see [1] and [2]). A complete
                 animation of an arbitrary number of frames is encoded
                 in a single image. The animation can be played using
                 the color table animation technique, which is very
                 effective even on low-end workstations. A cyclic set of
                 textures can be produced as well and then encoded in a
                 common animation format or used for texture mapping on
                 3D objects. As compared to other approaches, the method
                 presented in this paper produces smoother animations
                 and is more effective, both in memory requirements to
                 store the animation, and in computation time.",

                 load imposed by implementation issues. The
                 hierarchically structured bounding boxes help us to
                 quickly isolate the contour of segments in

                 introduced to treat the interference detection problem
                 involving the representation of arbitrary shaped

                 exploiting a multiresolution model based on tetrahedral
                 meshes. Multiresolution models, also called
                 Level-Of-Detail (LOD) models, allow encoding the whole
                 data set at a virtually continuous range of different
                 resolutions. We have identified a set of queries for
                 extracting meshes at variable resolution from a
                 multiresolution model, based on field values, domain
                 location, or opacity of the transfer function. Such
                 queries allow trading off between resolution and speed
                 in visualization. We define a new compact data
                 structure for encoding a multiresolution tetrahedral

                 refinement efficiently and show that such a structure

                 the researcher when trying to understand the evolution
                 of edifices and sites. Documentary sources provide
                 partial evidences from which he will infer possible
                 scenarios on how an edifice may have changed throughout
                 the centuries. But the growing mass of documents
                 researchers handle has underlined the necessity to find
                 out solutions for enhanced interfacing and
                 visualisation of this wide and heterogeneous
                 documentation. On the other hand, 2D or 3D
                 representation has historically been at the heart of
                 the way edifices or sites are described, visualised,
                 documented and understood. Why shouldn't it be so
                 today? State of the art in our field shows this is far
                 from being a reality. 2D graphics, with the development
                 of SVG-based applications, have undoubtedly found a
                 role in geo-visualisation, but not yet in architecture.
                 Moreover, 3D models remain today most often only in
                 relation with communications goals. Virtual renderings,
                 although presented as visualisations of an edifice,
                 mask the semantics behind the scene. Such seducing
                 results may be of great use, they may be seen as
                 visualisation of geometrical shapes, but in no way can
                 they be considered as visualisation of the deeply
                 uncertain architectural heritage data. We propose an
                 approach of data visualisation in which graphics act as
                 interpretations. Objects represented are given
                 appearances that show what can be stated from the
                 reading of their documentation. Documentation is
                 analysed and attached to architectural concepts with
                 respect to the notion of scale. Dynamically generated
                 2D/3D graphics are used both as visualisations of the
                 documentation's analysis and as interfaces to the
                 documentation's database. Our experimental set is the
                 centre of the city of Krak{\'{o}}w (Poland). We
                 introduce in this paper the recent developments of our
                 research : the handling of multiple scales and
                 consequently of multiple interfaces (2D/3D), the use of
                 each object's 'repurposable' XML data in the dynamic

                 representation of a surface. Although they have been
                 widely used in modeling contexts, their application to
                 visualization has been relatively limited due to
                 rendering difficulties. Typical explicit triangulation
                 of the surface, though effective, results in a
                 redundant representation and a high load on the bus
                 between the CPU and the graphics pipeline. In this
                 work, we present an alternative method that allows high
                 quality visualization of iso-surfaces with lower
                 communication requirements. Our proposal is based on
                 the combination of implicit surfaces with displacement
                 mapping techniques. The application of displacement
                 maps on a coarse mesh approximating the implicit model
                 avoids the necessity of explicit triangulation and
                 reduces the bus load without loss of image quality. The
                 examination of the iso-surface contour, by means of a
                 frequency analysis, allows for automatic creation of
                 the displacement map which better suits to the implicit
                 model in question. In this study we demonstrate the
                 validity of the proposal as an efficient alternative to
                 polygonization of implicit surfaces, thus opening many

                 vision model and an adaptive way to compute an image
                 metric based on a vision model. Metrics are very useful
                 in computer graphics. Applications include
                 perceptually-based rendering or image comparison for
                 photorealism. Usual vision model-based metrics make an
                 expensive use of memory and cpu resources, mainly for
                 two reasons. First, the vision model is a pipeline of
                 non linear functions applying on a multi-scale
                 decomposition of the image. Second, the model is
                 computed for every single pixel of the picture. In this
                 paper, we designed a very simple mono-scale vision
                 model taking into account many perceptual issues like
                 masking effects and adaptation. We also propose an
                 adaptive approach of distance computation : the image
                 plane sample scheme is designed to be denser when
                 distance variation is greater. This method is usable
                 with any vision model and only uses two parameters,
                 making it very easy to configure. By combining it with
                 our simple vision model, it computes a difference map

                 sorting, the Binary-Space-Partitioned Image (BSPI), to
                 accelerate real-time image-based rendering. BSPI is an
                 efficient 2D realization of a 3D BSP tree, which is
                 commonly used in computer graphics for time-critical
                 visibility sorting. Since the overall structure of a
                 BSP tree is encoded in a BSPI, traversing a BSPI is
                 comparable to traversing the corresponding BSP tree.
                 BSPI performs visibility sorting efficiently and
                 accurately in the 2D image space by warping the
                 reference image triangle-by-triangle instead of

                 The painting method incorporates some novel properties

                 there exists a certain constraint between three shadows
                 on the plane; i.e., three cross points determined by
                 pairs of tangential lines must sit on a straight line.
                 This property is considered to be a derivation of
                 epipolar geometry. However, the situation we treat is a
                 special one in which a explicit feature can emerge. We

                 the data acquisition occurs over a relatively long
                 time, typically in the range of 5-30 minutes. During
                 this period, the patient must lie still to guarantee
                 the image quality. Nevertheless, patient movement has
                 frequently been reported in clinical applications. This
                 movement causes misalignment of the projection frames,
                 which degrades the reconstructed image and may
                 introduce artifacts. However, the ability to detect and
                 correct for the motion using a computational method is
                 valuable for quality assurance of SPECT imaging. In
                 this work a correlation function based on Linogram and

                 estimate the occurred motion and correct it for the

                 artifacts of our cases reduced considerably and our
                 results showed that the misalignment (motion) between
                 the projections could be found with a small error
                 depending on the resolution of the images (pixel size),
                 and the time and duration of the applied motion during

                 considered a key problem with important applications in

                 but independently of the chosen strategy, different
                 stages of the solution are considered. It is not only
                 relevant to apply a good static collision test,
                 reducing the pairs of objects susceptible of
                 intersecting is important in order to obtain suitable

                 Voronoi Diagram, but changing the Euclidean distance

                 object in the scene is owner of a polar region as the
                 locus of points with some common angle properties.

  abstract =     "Tomographic imaging is a technique for exploration of
                 a cross-section of an inspected object without
                 destruction. Normally, the input data, known as the
                 projections, are gathered by repeatedly radiating
                 coherent waveform through the object in a number of
                 viewpoints, and receiving by an array of corresponding
                 detector in the opposite position. In this research, as
                 a replacement of radiographs, the series of photographs
                 taken around the opaque object under the ambient light
                 is completely served as the projections. From the
                 process of tomography, the outcome is the stack of
                 pseudo cross-sectional image. Not the internal of cross
                 section is authentic, but the edge or contour is valid.
                 Several applications can implicitly take advantages
                 from the stack of contour, for instance, 3D
                 true-colored modelling and geometric measurements.
                 Nevertheless, the process has a problem to extract the
                 highly concave-shape object due to the blind of camera

                 geography-related statistical information, such as
                 population demographics and epidemiological data. The
                 basic idea is to distort a map by resizing its regions
                 according to a statistical parameter, but in a way that
                 keeps the map recognizable. In this study, we formally
                 define a family of cartogram drawing problems. We show
                 that even simple variants are unsolvable in the general
                 case. Because the feasible variants are NP-complete,
                 heuristics are needed to solve the problem. Previously
                 proposed solutions suffer from problems with the
                 quality of the generated drawings. For a cartogram to
                 be recognizable, it is important to preserve the global
                 shape or outline of the input map, a requirement that
                 has been overlooked in the past. To address this, our
                 objective function for cartogram drawing includes both
                 global and local shape preservation. To measure the
                 degree of shape preservation, we propose a shape
                 similarity function, which is based on a Fourier
                 transformation of the polygons' curvatures. Also, our
                 application is visualization of dynamic data, for which
                 we need an algorithm that recalculates a cartogram in a
                 few seconds. None of the previous algorithms provides
                 adequate performance with an acceptable level of
                 quality for this application. In this paper, we
                 therefore propose an efficient iterative scanline
                 algorithm to reposition edges while preserving local
                 and global shapes. Scanlines may be generated
                 automatically or entered interactively to guide the
                 optimization process more closely. We apply our
                 algorithm to several example data sets and provide a

                 reflectances are measured and more spectra with higher
                 saturated colors are generated using Bouguer's law.
                 These spectra serve as the basis for constructing the
                 spectra for any colors. Given a color triplet P, in the

                 coordinates in the Eigenvector basis, are called
                 principal components. Since Kernel PCA is nothing but a
                 PCA in feature space , the projection of an image in
                 input space can be constructed from its principal
                 components in feature space. This paper starts with
                 relational theories concerning kernel and principal
                 component extraction. Then the focus is converged onto
                 de-noising and recovering images (i.e. finding the
                 exact or approximate pre-image of a noised and deformed
                 one in an example database). To make the above theories
                 and applications persuasive, several experiments on

                 include finding pre-images (exact or approximate) based
                 on a small database composed of one Chinese character
                 of different fonts, and another database of similar

  abstract =     "This paper proposes a novel approach for smoothing
                 surfaces represented by triangular meshes. The proposed
                 method is a two-step procedure: surface normal
                 smoothing through fuzzy vector median (FVM) filtering
                 followed by integration of surface normals for vertex
                 position update based on the least square error (LSE)
                 criteria. Median and Order Statistic-based filters are
                 extensively used in signal processing, especially image
                 processing, due to their ability to reject outliers and
                 preserve features such as edges and monotonic regions.
                 More recently, fuzzy ordering theory has been
                 introduced to allow averaging among similarly valued
                 samples. Fuzzy ordering theory leads naturally to the
                 fuzzy median, which yields improved noise smoothing
                 over traditional crisp median filters. This paper
                 extends the fuzzy ordering concept to vector-based data
                 and introduces the fuzzy vector median filter. The
                 application of FVM filters to surface normal smoothing
                 yields improved results over previously introduced
                 normal smoothing algorithms. The improved filtering
                 results, coupled with LSE vertex position update,
                 produces surface smoothing that minimizes the effects
                 of noise while simultaneously preserving detail
                 features. The proposed method is simple to implement
                 and relatively fast. Simulation results are presented
                 showing the performance of the proposed method and its
                 advantages over commonly used surface smoothing
                 algorithms. Additionally, optimization procedures for
                 FVM filters are derived and evaluated.",

                 function that describes the appearance of a real-world
                 surface as a function of lighting and viewing
                 directions. The BTF can model the fine-scale shadows,
                 occlusions, and specularities caused by surface
                 mesostructures. In this paper, we present algorithms
                 for efficient synthesis of BTFs on arbitrary surfaces
                 and for hardware-accelerated rendering. For both
                 synthesis and rendering, a main challenge is handling
                 the large amount of data in a BTF sample. To addresses
                 this challenge, we approximate the BTF sample by a
                 small number of 4D point appearance functions (PAFs)
                 multiplied by 2D geometry maps. The geometry maps and
                 PAFs lead to efficient synthesis and fast rendering of
                 BTFs on arbitrary surfaces. For synthesis, a surface
                 BTF can be generated by applying a texton-based
                 sysnthesis algorithm to a small set of 2D geometry maps
                 while leaving the companion 4D PAFs untouched. As for
                 rendering, a surface BTF synthesized using geometry
                 maps is well-suited for leveraging the programmable
                 vertex and pixel shaders on the graphics hardware. We

                 multiprojector display systems feasible without undue
                 infrastructure changes and maintenance. As a result,
                 front-projection displays are being used to generate
                 seamless, visually immersive worlds for virtual reality

                 maintenance overhead. However, these systems suffer
                 from a fundamental problem: Users and other objects in

                 projectors, creating shadows on the displayed image.
                 Shadows occlude potentially important information and

                 display while it is in use. Cameras observe the display
                 and compare observations with an expected image to
                 detect shadowed regions. These regions are transformed
                 to the appropriate projector frames, where
                 corresponding pixel values are increased and/or
                 attenuated. In display regions where more than one

                 algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto

                 environments. The need for accurate surgical simulation
                 has spurred the development of many of the new
                 real-time FE methodologies that enable haptic support
                 and real-time deformation. These techniques are
                 computationally intensive and it has proved to be a
                 challenge to achieve the high modeling resolutions
                 required to accurately represent complex anatomies. The
                 authors present a new real-time methodology based on
                 linear FE analysis that is appropriate for a wide range
                 of surgical simulation applications. A methodology is
                 proposed that is characterized by high model
                 resolution, low preprocessing time, unrestricted
                 multipoint surface contact, and adjustable boundary
                 conditions. These features make the method ideal for
                 modeling suturing, which is an element common to almost
                 every surgical procedure. This paper describes

                 for compression and multiresolution representation. Our
                 method combines three approaches: subdivision surfaces
                 of arbitrary topology, B-spline wavelets, and the
                 lifting scheme for biorthogonal wavelet construction.
                 The simple building blocks of our wavelet transform are
                 local lifting operations performed on polygonal meshes
                 with subdivision hierarchy. Starting with a coarse,
                 irregular polyhedral base mesh, our transform creates a
                 subdivision hierarchy of meshes converging to a smooth
                 limit surface. At every subdivision level, geometric
                 detail can be expanded from wavelet coefficients and
                 added to the surface. We present wavelet constructions
                 for bilinear, bicubic, and biquintic B-Spline

                 constructions perform well in numerical experiments,
                 the biquintic construction turns out to be unstable.
                 For lossless compression, our transform can be computed
                 in integer arithmetic, mapping integer coordinates of
                 control points to integer wavelet coefficients. Our
                 approach provides a highly efficient and progressive

                 fidelity for facial expression animation while
                 optimizing the computation. Our facial model has a
                 multilayer biomechanical structure, incorporating a
                 physically-based approximation to facial skin tissue, a
                 set of anatomically-motivated facial muscle actuators,
                 and underlying skull structure. In contrast to existing
                 mass-spring-damper (MSD) facial models, our dynamic
                 skin model uses the nonlinear springs to directly
                 simulate the nonlinear visco-elastic behavior of soft
                 tissue and a new kind of edge repulsion spring is
                 developed to prevent collapse of the skin model.
                 Different types of muscle models have been developed to
                 simulate distribution of the muscle force applied on
                 the skin due to muscle contraction. The presence of the
                 skull advantageously constrain the skin movements,
                 resulting in more accurate facial deformation and also
                 guides the interactive placement of facial muscles. The
                 governing dynamics are computed using a local
                 semi-implicit ODE solver. In the dynamic simulation, an
                 adaptive refinement automatically adapts the local
                 resolution at which potential inaccuracies are detected
                 depending on local deformation. The method, in effect,
                 ensures the required speedup by concentrating
                 computational time only where needed while ensuring
                 realistic behavior within a predefined error threshold.

                 Multiresolution triangle mesh representations are an
                 important tool for reducing triangle mesh complexity in
                 interactive rendering environments. Ideally, for

                 to yield insight into the following question: If we
                 could design the ideal texture pattern to apply to an
                 arbitrary smoothly curving surface in order to enable
                 its 3D shape to be most accurately and effectively
                 perceived, what would the characteristics of that
                 texture pattern be? We begin by reviewing the results
                 of our initial study in this series, which were
                 presented at the 2003 IEEE Symposium on Information
                 Visualization, and offer an expanded analysis of those
                 findings. We continue by presenting the results of a
                 follow-on study in which we sought to more specifically
                 investigate the separate and combined influences on
                 shape perception of particular texture components, with
                 the goal of obtaining a clearer view of their potential
                 information carrying capacities. In each study, we
                 investigated the observers' ability to identify the
                 intrinsic shape category of a surface patch
                 (elliptical, hyperbolic, cylindrical, or flat) and its
                 extrinsic surface orientation (convex, concave, both,
                 or neither). In our first study, we compared
                 performance under eight different texture type
                 conditions, plus two projection conditions (perspective
                 or orthographic) and two viewing conditions (head-on or
                 oblique). In this study, we found that: 1) Shape
                 perception was better facilitated, in general, by the
                 bidirectional 'principal direction grid' pattern than
                 by any of the seven other patterns tested; 2) shape
                 type classification accuracy remained high under the
                 orthographic projection condition for some texture
                 types when the viewpoint was oblique; 3) perspective
                 projection was required for accurate surface
                 orientation classification; and 4) shape classification
                 accuracy was higher when the surface patches were
                 oriented at a (generic) oblique angle to the line of
                 sight than when they were oriented (in a nongeneric
                 pose) to face the viewpoint straight on. In our second
                 study, we compared performance under eight new texture
                 type conditions, redesigned to facilitate gathering
                 insight into the cumulative effects of specific
                 individual irectional components in a wider variety of
                 multidirectional texture patterns. In this - follow-on
                 study, we found that shape classification accuracy was
                 equivalently good under a variety of test patterns that
                 included components following either the first or first
                 and second principal directions, in addition to other
                 directions, suggesting that a principal direction grid
                 texture is not the only possible 'best option' for
                 enhancing shape representation.",

  abstract =     "We present an innovative modeling and rendering
                 primitive, called the O-buffer, as a framework for
                 sample-based graphics. The 2D or 3D O-buffer is, in
                 essence, a conventional image or a volume,
                 respectively, except that samples are not restricted to
                 a regular grid. A sample position in the O-buffer is
                 recorded as an offset to the nearest grid point of a
                 regular base grid (hence the name O-buffer). The
                 O-buffer can greatly improve the expressive power of
                 images and volumes. Image quality can be improved by
                 storing more spatial information with samples and by
                 avoiding multiple resamplings. It can be exploited to
                 represent and render unstructured primitives, such as
                 points, particles, and curvilinear or irregular
                 volumes. The O-buffer is therefore a unified
                 representation for a variety of graphics primitives and
                 supports mixing them in the same scene. It is a
                 semiregular structure which lends itself to efficient
                 construction and rendering. O-buffers may assume a
                 variety of forms including 2D O-buffers, 3D O-buffers,
                 uniform O-buffers, nonuniform O-buffers, adaptive
                 O-buffers, layered-depth O-buffers, and O-buffer trees.
                 We demonstrate the effectiveness of the the O-buffer in
                 a variety of applications, such as image-based
                 rendering, point sample rendering, and volume

                 interactively and to modify the appearance of the

                 decouple the visualization pipeline into two disjoint
                 stages. First, flow lines are generated from the 3D
                 vector data. Various geometric of the flow paths are
                 extracted and converted into a volumetric form using a

                 lighting model to simulate the effects on translucent
                 meshes. Our approximations are based on the observation
                 that subsurface scattering is relatively local due to
                 its exponential falloff.In the preprocessing stage we
                 build subsurface scattering neighborhood information,
                 which includes all the vertices within effective
                 scattering range from each vertex. We then modify the
                 traditional local illumination model into a run-time
                 two-stage process. The first stage involves computation
                 of reflection and transmission of light on surface
                 vertices. The second stage bleeds in scattering effects
                 from a vertex's neighborhood to generate the final
                 result. We then merge the run-time two-stage process
                 into a run-time single-stage process using precomputed
                 integrals, and reduce the complexity of our run-time
                 algorithm to O(N), where N is the number of vertices.
                 The selection of the optimum set size for precomputed
                 integrals is guided by a standard imagespace

  abstract =     "In the past twenty years, many algorithms have been
                 proposed to compute global illumination in synthetic
                 scenes. Typically, such approaches can deal with
                 specific lighting configurations, but often have
                 difficulties with others. In this article, we present a
                 final reconstruction step for a novel unified approach
                 to global illumination that automatically detects
                 different types of light transfer and uses the
                 appropriate method in a closely-integrated manner. With
                 our approach, we can deal with difficult lighting
                 configurations such as indirect nondiffuse
                 illumination. The first step of this algorithm consists
                 in a view-independent solution based on hierarchical
                 radiosity with clustering, integrated with particle
                 tracing. This first pass results in solutions
                 containing directional effects such as caustics, which
                 can be interactively rendered. The second step consists
                 of a view-dependent final reconstruction that uses all
                 existing information to compute higher quality,

                 isosurface extraction from volumetric representations,
                 obtained by 3D photography, CT, or MRI. Noise inherent
                 in the acquisition process can lead to geometrical and
                 topological errors. Reducing geometrical errors during
                 reconstruction is well studied. However, isosurfaces
                 often contain many topological errors in the form of
                 tiny handles. These nearly invisible artifacts hinder
                 subsequent operations like mesh simplification,
                 remeshing, and parametrization. In this article we
                 present a practical method for removing handles in an
                 isosurface. Our algorithm makes an axis-aligned sweep
                 through the volume to locate handles, compute their
                 sizes, and selectively remove them. The algorithm is
                 designed to facilitate out-of-core execution. It finds
                 the handles by incrementally constructing and analyzing
                 a Reeb graph. The size of a handle is measured by a
                 short nonseparating cycle. Handles are removed robustly
                 by modifying the volume rather than attempting 'mesh
                 surgery.' Finally, the volumetric modifications are
                 spatially localized to preserve geometrical detail. We
                 demonstrate topology simplification on several complex

                 An attribute is a mathematical model of an object
                 property of an arbitrary nature (material, photometric,
                 physical, statistical, etc.). In our approach, the
                 function representation (FRep) is used as the basic
                 model for both object geometry and attributes
                 represented independently using real-valued scalar
                 functions of point coordinates. While FRep directly
                 defines object geometry, for an attribute it specifies
                 a space partition used to define the attribute
                 function. We propose a volume sculpting scheme with
                 multiresolution capability based on trivariate B-spline
                 functions to define both object geometry and its
                 attributes. A new trivariate B-spline primitive is
                 proposed that can be used as a leaf in an FRep
                 constructive tree. An interactive volume modeler based
                 on trivariate B-splines and other simple primitives is
                 described, with a real-time repolygonization of the
                 surface during modeling. We illustrate that the space
                 partition obtained in the modeling process can be
                 applied to define attributes for the objects with an
                 arbitrary geometry model such as BRep or homogeneous

                 knots, including knots around other objects, in real

                 interactions. Another component of the simulator
                 precisely detects self-collisions in the rope as well

                 partial differential equation (PDE) to solve a class of
                 surface-blending problems. This equation has three
                 vector-valued shape control parameters. It incorporates
                 all the previously published forms of fourth-order PDEs
                 for surface blending and can generate a larger class of
                 blending surfaces than existing equations. To apply the
                 proposed PDE to the solution of various blending
                 problems, we have developed a fast and accurate
                 resolution method. Our method modifies Naviers solution
                 for the elastic bending deformation of thin plates by
                 making it satisfy the boundary conditions exactly. A
                 comparison between our method, the closed-form solution
                 method, and other existing analytical methods indicates
                 that the developed method is able to generate blending
                 surfaces almost as quickly and accurately as the
                 closed-form solution method, far more efficiently and
                 accurately than the numerical methods and other

                 force function of the proposed equation have on the

                 significant influence on its shape. They provide
                 flexible user handles that surface designers can use to
                 adjust the blending surface to acquire the desired
                 shape. The developed method was employed in the

                 through a topological graph or a cut graph (polygonal
                 scheme). Over the past few years, many studies have
                 focused on extracting the topological and cut graphs of
                 complex freeform objects that are represented by
                 meshes. For an object with genus-n, the topological
                 graph has n cycles, while the cut graph contains 2n
                 cycles. These loops, however, do not always explicitly
                 represent the holes in the objects. That is, a cycle in
                 the graph can be a cycle around a solid (meridian), a
                 cycle around a hole (longitude), or almost any
                 combination of the two. The task of classifying the
                 cycles (generators) as cycles around holes (longitude)
                 and cycles around solids (meridians) on the mesh is not
                 straightforward. Every closed orientable 2-manifold
                 with genus-n can be seen as a collection of n toruses
                 stitched together, so that each hole in the object can
                 be referred to as a torus with two generators. This
                 paper proposes a method that extracts the generators
                 from which the longitudes and the meridians are found.
                 The topological graph is defined by the longitudes and
                 by a spanning tree constructed between them. The cut
                 graph is constructed using the same concept. The
                 advantage of the proposed method over other methods is
                 that each loop in the topological graph explicitly

                 method to simulate gaseous phenomena. In our approach,
                 the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations
                 governing fluid motion have been modeled in a novel way
                 to achieve a realistic animation. We introduce the
                 Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM), which simulates the
                 microscopic movement of fluid particles by linear and
                 local rules on a grid of cells so that the macroscopic
                 averaged properties obey the desired NS equations. The
                 LBM is defined on a 2D or 3D discrete lattice, which is
                 used to solve fluid animation based on different
                 boundary conditions. The LBM simulation generates, in
                 real-time, an accurate velocity field and can
                 incorporate an optional temperature field to account
                 for the buoyancy force of hot gas. Because of the
                 linear and regular operations in each local cell of the

                 desktop virtual reality. The most commonly used
                 rotation technique is a virtual trackball surrounding
                 the object and operated by the mouse pointer. This
                 article reviews and provides a mathematical foundation
                 for virtual trackballs. The first, but still popular,
                 virtual trackball was described by Chen et al. We show
                 that the virtual trackball by Chen et al. does not
                 rotate the object along the intended great circular arc
                 on the virtual trackball and we give a correction.
                 Another popular virtual trackball is Shoemake's
                 quaternion implementation, which we show to be a
                 special case of the virtual trackball by Chen et al..

                 reviews some of the landmark techniques used in
                 real-time PC applications, including the authors? novel
                 solution of using 2.5 dimensional impostors for tree

                 extending the later algorithm to rendering dense forest
                 for human-scale simulation. The method presented takes
                 full advantage of the programmable rendering pipelines

                 efficient rendering of out-of-core terrain data sets.
                 For huge data sets the use of preprocessed tiles has
                 proven to be more efficient than continuous levels of
                 detail, since in the latter case the screen space error
                 has to be verified for individual triangles. There are
                 some prevailing problems of these approaches: i) the
                 partitioning and simplification of the original data
                 set and ii) the accurate rendering of these data sets.
                 Current approaches still trade the approximation error
                 in image space for increased frame rates. To overcome
                 these problems we propose a data structure and LOD
                 scheme. These enable the real-time rendering of
                 out-of-core data sets while guaranteeing geometric and
                 texture accuracy of one pixel between original and
                 rendered mesh in image space. To accomplish this, we
                 utilize novel scalable techniques for integrated
                 simplification, compression, and rendering. The
                 combination of these techniques with impostors and
                 occlusion culling yields a truly output sensitive
                 algorithm for terrain data sets. We demonstrate the
                 potential of our approach by presenting results for
                 several terrain data sets with sizes up to 16k x 16k.
                 The results show the unprecedented fidelity of the

                 and the signs of the wavelet coefficients that will be
                 transmitted as nonzero values in an embedded scheme.
                 This algorithm is based on recursive partitioning of
                 the significant wavelet sub-bands (RPSWS). The proposed
                 algorithm produces a fully embedded bit stream and it

                 is the visualization of large, complex information

                 recent years, both in number and in size. Images of the
                 data stored in these collections must support rapid and
                 accurate exploration and analysis. This article
                 presents a method for constructing visualizations that
                 are both effective and aesthetic. Our approach uses
                 techniques from master paintings and human perception
                 to visualize a multidimensional dataset. Individual
                 data elements are drawn with one or more brush strokes
                 that vary their appearance to represent the element's
                 attribute values. The result is a nonphotorealistic
                 visualization of information stored in the dataset. Our
                 research extends existing glyph-based and
                 nonphotorealistic techniques by applying perceptual
                 guidelines to build an effective representation of the
                 underlying data. The nonphotorealistic properties the
                 strokes employ are selected from studies of the history
                 and theory of Impressionist art. We show that these
                 properties are similar to visual features that are
                 detected by the low-level human visual system. This
                 correspondence allows us to manage the strokes to
                 produce perceptually salient visualizations.

                 are presented on the same screen and at the same view

                 difference between the athlete motion in sport video
                 and the simulated motion. It is very helpful to coaches

  abstract =     "In this paper we present a new technique for rendering
                 very large datasets representing point-sampled
                 surfaces. Rendering efficiency is considerably improved
                 by using stochastic sampling that is controlled using
                 various object and view dependent image space
                 properties. Most of the current rendering algorithms
                 simplify the model in a preprocessing step before
                 rendering. This simplification primarily results in a
                 smaller subset of sampled points. Hence these
                 algorithms suffer from the problem of under-sampling
                 when the screen space resolution becomes greater than
                 the sampling rate inherent in the simplified
                 representation. Our algorithm avoids this problem by
                 accessing the original point data set at all times and
                 dynamically selecting points to display at rendering
                 time. As a side benefit our preprocessing is much
                 simpler and preprocessing time is also considerably
                 reduced, albeit at the cost of increased disk and
                 memory usage. We also include an algorithm to correctly
                 estimate properly oriented normals, which are essential

                 applications for which a mesh parametrization is
                 needed. Because, many polygonal surfaces are manifolds
                 of genus 0, we can apply a mapping, in which 2-d polar
                 coordinates of a sphere can be directly transformed
                 onto the 3-d coordinates of a polygonal object. In this
                 paper we present a hierarchical mapping algorithm, that
                 preserves the local surface properties. Our method
                 consists of three main-steps. First, the mesh is
                 simplified to a tetrahedron. Next, the tetrahedron will
                 be transformed to a spherical surface in which the
                 previous simplification process will be reversed on the
                 surface of the sphere. Hereby, in every refinement step
                 the new vertices are inserted and the resulting
                 parametrization mesh is optimized to be barycentric.
                 Finally, the resulting barycentric mesh is used as the
                 basis for a shape-preserving optimization process. The
                 efficiency of these method will be shown by using our

                 Coordinates by a polygonal line P (see [Ins99] for a
                 recent survey). Earlier [Ins85], a surface S was
                 represented as the envelope of the polygonal lines
                 representing it's points. This is ambiguous in the
                 sense that different surfaces can provide the same
                 envelopes. Here the ambiguity is eliminated by
                 considering the surface S as the envelope of it's
                 tangent planes and in turn, representing each of these
                 planes by n-1 points [Ins99]. This yields a new and
                 unambiguous representation, S, of the surface
                 consisting of n-1 planar regions whose properties
                 correspond lead to the recognition of the surfaces'
                 properties i.e. developable, ruled etc. [Hun92]) and
                 classification criteria. It is further shown that the
                 image (i.e. representation) of an algebraic surface of
                 degree 2 in R^n is a region whose boundary is also an

                 non-convex surfaces which with the previous ambiguous

                 image-space technique for efficient collision detection
                 of arbitrarily shaped, water-tight objects. In contrast
                 to existing approaches that do not consider

                 graphics hardware rely on multipass rendering that
                 includes reading and writing large amounts of pixel
                 data from and to the frame buffer. Since the
                 performance of this data path has hardly improved over
                 the last years, we describe new implementation
                 techniques that efficiently use modern graphics
                 hardware. 1) The render-to-texture ability is used to
                 temporarily store shape visibility, avoiding the
                 expensive copy of z-buffer content to external memory.
                 Shape visibility is encoded discretely instead of using
                 depth values. Hence, the technique is also not
                 susceptible to artifacts in contrast to previously
                 described methods. 2) We present an image-based
                 technique for calculating the depth complexity of a CSG
                 shape that avoids reading and analyzing pixel data from
                 the frame buffer. Both techniques optimize various CSG
                 rendering algorithms, namely the Goldfeather and the
                 layered Goldfeather algorithm, and the
                 Sequenced-Convex-Subtraction (SCS) algorithm. This way,
                 these image-based CSG algorithms now operate
                 accelerated by graphics hardware and, therefore,

                 with or without holes, as well as a collision detection

                 algorithm has been compared with the well-known PIVOT2D
                 one and better results have been achieved in most
                 situations. This improvement together with its possible
                 extension to 3D makes it an attractive method because
                 pre-processing of the polygons is no longer necessary.
                 Besides, since this method uses sign operations, it
                 proves to be a simple, more efficient and robust

                 Recognition, Medical Image Analysis and Remotely Sensed
                 Image Processing. We introduce a non-iterative
                 geometric-based method to register an image using a
                 novel set of geometric landmarks residing on an
                 extracted 2D contours from the image. These landmarks
                 are intrinsic and are computed from the differential
                 geometry of the curve. We exploit the invariant
                 properties of maximum-curvature points that are local
                 and preserved under the affine and some perspective
                 transformation. Geometric invariant exploits coplanar
                 five-point invariant constructed from 4 consecutive
                 landmarks and a centroid. This invariant is preserved
                 not only in affine map but weak perspective map as
                 well. To reduce the sensitivity of the landmarks to
                 noise, we use a B-Spline surface representation that
                 smoothes out the curve prior to the computation of the
                 landmarks. The alignment is achieved by establishing
                 correspondences between the landmarks after a conformal
                 sorting based on derived absolute invariant. The

                 scattered points plays an important role in solving a
                 wide variety of problems occurring in computer graphics
                 modelling, computer graphics animation, and computer
                 assisted surgery. The fitted implicit surfaces can be
                 either algebraic or non-algebraic. The main problem
                 with most algebraic surface fitting algorithms is that
                 the surface fitted to a given data set is often
                 unbounded, multiple sheeted, and disconnected when a
                 high degree polynomial is used, whereas a low degree
                 polynomial is too simple to represent general shapes.
                 Recently, there has been increasing interest in
                 non-algebraic implicit surface fitting. In these
                 techniques, one popular way of representing an implicit
                 surface has been the use of radial basis functions.
                 This type of implicit surface can represent various
                 shapes to a high level of accuracy. In this paper, we
                 present an implicit surface fitting algorithm using
                 radial basis functions with an ellipsoid constraint.
                 This method does not need to build interior and
                 exterior layers for the given data set or to use
                 information on surface normal but still can fit the
                 data accurately. Furthermore, the fitted shape can
                 still capture the main features of the object when the
                 data sets are extremely sparse. The algorithm involves
                 solving a simple general eigen-system and a computation
                 of the inverse or psedo-inverse of a matrix, which is
                 straightforward to implement.",

                 dissimilarity measure between the input and the claimed

                 palmprint input is verified possessing same identity as
                 the claimed identity template. This paper introduces an
                 experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of
                 utilizing three well known orthogonal moments, namely
                 Zernike Moments, Pseudo Zernike Moments and Legendre
                 Moments, in the application of palmprint verification.
                 Moments are the most commonly used technique in
                 character feature extraction. The idea of implementing
                 orthogonal moments as palmprint feature extractors is
                 prompted by the fact that principal features of both
                 character and palmprint are based on line structure.
                 These orthogonal moments are able to define statistical
                 and geometrical features containing line structure
                 information about palmprint. An experimental study
                 about verification rate of the palmprint authentication
                 system using these three orthogonal moments as feature
                 descriptors has been discussed here. Experimental
                 results show that the performance of the system is
                 dependent on the moment order as well as the type of
                 moment invariant. The orthogonal property of these
                 moments is able to characterize independent features of
                 the palmprint image and thus have minimum information
                 redundancy in a moment set. The Pseudo Zernike Moments
                 of order of 15 has the best performance among all the
                 moments. Its verification rate is 95.75%, which also

                 should be made to adapt computers to our natural means
                 of communication: speech and body language. The PUI
                 paradigm has emerged as a post-WIMP interface paradigm
                 in order to cover these preferences. The aim of this
                 paper is the proposal of a real time vision system for
                 its application within visual interaction environments
                 through hand gesture recognition, using general-purpose
                 hardware and low cost sensors, like a simple personal
                 computer and an USB web cam, so any user could make use
                 of it in his office or home. The basis of our approach
                 is a fast segmentation process to obtain the moving
                 hand from the whole image, which is able to deal with a
                 large number of hand shapes against different

                 process that identifies the hand posture from the
                 temporal sequence of segmented hands. The most
                 important part of the recognition process is a robust
                 shape comparison carried out through a Hausdorff
                 distance approach, which operates on edge maps. The use
                 of a visual memory allows the system to handle

                 comes the need to display clear handwritten characters
                 at small sizes on low-resolution displays. This paper
                 describes a method for automatically constructing
                 hinted TrueType fonts from on-line handwriting data.
                 Hints add extra information to glyph outlines in the

                 of the rasterization process. We use an aggressive

                 input glyph and a previously-hinted template,
                 considering both global and local features to allow
                 hinting even when they differ in shape and topology.
                 Recognizing that stroke width statistics are among
                 features that characterize a person's handwriting, we

                 In this paper, we introduce a method to transfer color
                 from a reference image to the whole video. Although the
                 general problem of adding chromatic values to a
                 grayscale image has no exact, objective solution, the

                 from a palette to color individual components, we
                 resort to anther color space, called lab, which
                 minimizes correlation between channels for many natural
                 scenes. Taking advantage of the correlation between two
                 conjoint frames of video, we track the object and
                 assign the color of it in the preceding frame to that
                 of the posterior one. Experimental results show the

                 texturing surfaces of arbitrary 3D objects. By uniquely
                 using solid textures and applying them to the surface,
                 we do not require an explicit parameterisation in
                 texture space. Various solid textures can be combined
                 by building a constructive texturing tree of space
                 partitions to define the photometric attributes at each
                 location of the object. Though solid texturing using
                 constructive textures is very powerful, mainly because
                 of its generality, it is quite difficult to use in
                 practice as it is not well suited to interactive tools.
                 To overcome this limitation, we use a multiresolution
                 point-based representation ensuring that texture
                 evaluation and rendering maintains a given frame rate.
                 Our tool is realized as a plugin for the {\it
                 Pointshop3D} system. The main advantage of our
                 texturing approach compared to Pointshop3D is that
                 point-based rendering is only used during the
                 interactive texturing step. We always keep a feedback
                 to the initial geometric representation of the object
                 (polygonal mesh, parametric or implicit surface, voxel
                 arrays, or whatever) which means that the final
                 textured object can be easily exported to standard
                 graphics software that cannot directly handle discrete
                 surface points (e.g. CAD systems, photorealistic

                 order of a sequence of stripes captured in an uncoded
                 structured light scanning system, i.e. where all the
                 stripes are projected with uniform colour, width and
                 spacing. A single bitmap image shows a pattern of
                 vertical stripes from a projected source, which are
                 deformed by the surface of the target object. If a
                 correspondence can be determined between the projected
                 stripes and those captured in the bitmap, a spatial
                 measurement of the surface can be derived using
                 standard rangefinding methods. Previous work has
                 uniquely encoded each stripe, such as by colour or
                 width, in order to avoid ambiguous stripe
                 identification. However, colour coding suffers due to
                 uneven colour reflection, and a variable width code
                 reduces the measured resolution. To avoid these
                 problems, we simplify the projection as a uniform
                 stripe pattern, and devise novel methods for correctly
                 indexing the stripes, including a new common
                 inclination constraint and occlusion classification. We
                 give definitions of patches and the continuity of
                 stripes, and measure the success of these methods. Thus
                 we eliminate the need for coding, and reduce the
                 accuracy required of the projected pattern; and, by
                 dealing with stripe continuity and occlusions in a new
                 manner, provide general methods which have relevance to
                 many structured light problems.",
