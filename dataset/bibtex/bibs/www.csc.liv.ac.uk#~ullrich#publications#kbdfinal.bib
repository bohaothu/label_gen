 ABSTRACT      = {In this paper I want to focus on some principal 
     differences between data models of database systems and knowledge 
     representation languages.  

     The data manipulation languages of data models are based on the
     closed-world, unique-name, and domain-closure assumption.
     Data manipulation languages and query languages of
     knowledge representation formalisms differ considerably in their
     underlying assumptions. They are based on the open-world, unique-name, 
     and open-domain assumption. 
     That means, that even if the data definition language and the data
     manipulation language of a database management system and a knowledge
     base management system would coincide, the results of data
     manipulations would differ. 

     I present some examples that show the usefulness
     of closed-world inferences in natural language processing. Thus
     knowledge representation languages sticking to the open-world
     assumption seem to be insufficient for natural language processing.}
