  abstract =	 {RoboCup has hosted a coach competition for several
                  years creating a challenging testbed for research in
                  advice-giving agents. A coach agent is expected to
                  advise an unknown coachable team. In RoboCup 2003,
                  the coachable agents could process the coach's
                  advice but did not include a protocol for
                  communication among them. In this paper we present
                  CommLang, a standard for agent communication which
                  will be used by the coachable agents in the
                  simulation league at RoboCup 2004. The communication
                  standard supports representation of multiple message
                  types which can be flexibly combined in a single
                  utterance. We then describe the application of
                  CommLang in our coachable agents and present
                  empirical results showing the communication's effect
                  on world model completeness and
                  accuracy. Communication in our agents improved the
                  fraction of time which our agents are confident of
                  player and ball locations and simultaneously
                  improved the overall accuracy of that information. },
