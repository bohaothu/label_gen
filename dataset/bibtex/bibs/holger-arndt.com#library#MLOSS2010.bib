author = {Arndt, Holger},
abstract = {The Universal Java Matrix Package (UJMP) is a data processing tool for Java. Unlike JAMA and Colt, it supports multi-threading and is therefore much faster on current hardware. It does not only support matrices with double values, but instead handles every type of data as a matrix through a common interface, e.g. CSV files, Excel files, images, WAVE audio files, tables in SQL data bases, and much more.},
