                  BRICS during August 1995\@. From 7--10 August
                  they held an intensive mini-course of 14 double
                  lectures on Evolving Algebras: their framework
                  for modelling algorithms and languages, with
                  links to both Complexity Theory and Semantics.
                  The background and interests of both lecturers
                  fitted particularly well with the BRICS idea of
                  synergy between Algorithms and Complexity
                  Theory, Semantics, and Logic.\bibpar
                  
                  The course was attended by 12 PhD students.
                  Gurevich's lectures on the basic concepts and
                  definitions of evolving algebras were all
                  prepared specially for the course, and
                  supported by a large collection of papers from
                  the literature. B{\"o}rger's lectures on
                  applications of evolving algebras were based on
                  some of his latest papers.\bibpar
                  
                  The course was organized by Peter D. Mosses.

                  by interacting or fully automatic tools.\bibpar The
                  23 papers of the proceedings cover the following
                  topics: refinement-based verification and
                  construction techniques; compositional verification
                  methodologies; analysis and verification via
