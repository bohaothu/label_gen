  Abstract =     {Haskell is a general purpose, purely functional
                  programming language incorporating many recent
                  innovations in programming language design. Haskell
                  provides higher-order functions, non-strict
                  semantics, static polymorphic typing, user-defined
                  algebraic datatypes, pattern-matching, list com-
                  prehensions, a module system, a monadic I/O system,
                  and a rich set of primitive datatypes, including
                  lists, arrays, arbitrary and fixed precision
                  integers, and floating-point numbers. Haskell is
                  both the culmination and solidification of many
                  years of research on non-strict functional
                  languages. This report defines the syntax for
                  Haskell programs and an informal abstract semantics
                  for the meaning of such programs. We leave as
                  implementation dependent the ways in which Haskell
                  programs are to be manipulated, interpreted,
                  compiled, etc. This includes such issues as the
                  nature of programming environments and the error
                  messages returned for undefined programs
                  (i.e. programs that formally evaluate to ). },

                  are often referred to as boilerplate code. The
                  definitions of functions involving such traversals
                  may repeat very similar patterns, but with
                  variations for different data types and different
                  functionality. Libraries of operations abstracting
                  away boilerplate code typically rely on elaborate
                  types to make operations generic. The motivating
                  observation for this paper is that most traversals
                  have value-specific behaviour for just one type. We
                  present the design of a new library exploiting this
                  assumption. Our library allows concise expression of
                  traversals with competitive performance.",
