 abstract={In this paper we obtain some results on coincidence and common fixed points for two pairs of multi-valued and single-valued non-self mappings in complete convex metric spaces. We improve on previously used methods of proof and obtain results for mappings which are not necessarily compatible and not necessarily continuous, generalizing some known results. In particular, a theorem by Rhoades \cite {rh2} and a theorem by Ahmed and Rhoades \cite {ar} are generalized and improved. }
