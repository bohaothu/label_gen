  abstract = {{R}estoration of atmospheric carbon in soils has principal many good effects. {A}rid lands cover more than 40 % of the global earth area, but only stock 16 % from the global carbon stock. {I}t seems to be a suitable solution for this environmental issue, but still all variables controlling organic carbon in such kinds of soil, was ignored. {T}his study aims to develop two models of organic carbon under clayey and sandy soils in semi-arid {M}editerranean zones basing on physical and chemical soil properties. {F}or establishing both models, structural equation modeling was used. {F}or modeling organic carbon, two {T}unisian soil databases composed from clayey and sandy soils made respectively, of 450 and 602 soil horizons were used. {U}sing the two databases for all properties, the principal component analysis shows two components for clayey soil; (i) chemical properties and bulk density and (ii) physical properties. {F}or the sandy soil it reveals two components; (i) chemical properties and (ii) physical properties. {A}ccording to the derived components for each soil category, two models have been built. {S}tructural equation modeling results show that clayey model has proved that organic carbon was controlled by chemical properties and bulk density more than physical properties and sandy model has proved that organic carbon was controlled by chemical properties more than physical properties. {T}he root mean square errors of approximation were 0.079 and 0.050 for the clayey and sandy models, respectively. {T}hen these two models were validated with two other databases from {T}unisian dryland soils.},
