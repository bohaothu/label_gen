  abstract = {This work investigates the interaction of carotenoid and chlorophyll
	triplet states in the peridinin-chlorophyll-a-protein (PCP) of Amphidinium
	carterae using step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
	We identify two carotenoid triplet state lifetimes of [~]13 and [~]42
	{micro}s in the spectral region between 1800 and 1100 cm1 after excitation
	of the blue' and red' peridinin (Per) conformers and the Qy of chlorophyll-a
	(Chl-a). The fast and slow decaying triplets exhibit different spectral
	signatures in the carbonyl region. The fast component generated at
	all excitation wavelengths is from a major conformer with a lactone
	stretching mode bleach at 1745 cm1. One (1720 cm1) and two (1720
	cm1 and 1741 cm1) different Per conformers are observed for the slow
	component upon 670- and 530480-nm excitation, respectively. The above
	result implies that 3Per triplets are formed via two different pathways,
	corroborating and complementing visible triplet-singlet (T-S) spectra
	(Kleima et al., Biochemistry (2000), 39, 5184). Surprisingly, all
	difference spectra show that Per and Chl-a modes are simultaneously
	present during the 3Per decay, implying significant involvement of
	3Chl-a in the 3Per state. We suggest that this Per-Chl-a interaction
	via a delocalized triplet state lowers the 3Per energy and thus provides
	a general, photoprotection mechanism for light-harvesting antenna
	complexes. },

  abstract = {The peridinin chlorophyll-a protein (PCP) is a water-soluble, trimeric
	light harvesting complex found in marine dinoflagellates that binds
	peridinin and Chl-a in an unusual stoichiometric ratio of 4 : 1.
	In this paper, the pathways of excited-state energy transfer and
	relaxation in PCP were identified by means of femtosecond visible-pump,
	mid-infrared probe spectroscopy. In addition, excited-state relaxation
	of peridinin dissolved in organic solvent (CHCl3 and MeOH) was investigated.
	For peridinin in solution, the transient IR signatures of the low-lying
	S-1 and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states were similar,
	in line with a previous ultrafast IR study. In PCP, excitation of
	the optically allowed S-2 state of peridinin results in ultrafast
	energy transfer to Chl-a, in competition with internal conversion
	to low-lying optically forbidden states of peridinin. After vibrational
	relaxation of the peridinin hot S-1 state in 150 fs, two separate
	low-lying peridinin singlet excited states are distinguished, assigned
	to an ICT state and to a slowly transferring, vibrationally relaxed
	S-1 state. These states exhibit different lactone bleaches, indicating
	that the ICT and S-1 states localize on distinct peridinins. Energy
	transfer from the peridinin ICT state to Chl-a constitutes the dominant
	energy transfer channel and occurs with a time constant of 2 ps.
	The peridinin S-1 state mainly decays to the ground state through
	internal conversion, in competition with slow energy transfer to
	Chl-a. The singlet excited state of Chl-a undergoes intersystem crossing
	(ISC) to the triplet state on the nanosecond timescale, followed
	by rapid triplet excitation energy transfer (TEET) from Chl-a to
	peridinin, whereby no Chl-a triplet is observed but rather a direct
	rise of the peridinin triplet. The latter contains some Chl-a features
	due to excitonic coupling of the pigments. The peridinin triplet
	state shows a lactone bleach mode at 1748 cm(-1), while that of the
	peridinin ICT state is located at 1745 cm(-1), indicating that the
	main channels of singlet and triplet energy transfer in PCP proceed
	through distinct peridinins. Our results are consistent with an energy
	transfer scheme where the ICT state mainly localizes on Per621/611
	and Per623/613, the S1 state on Per622/612 and the triplet state
	on Per624/614.}

	spectra of the CP47 core antenna complex of photosystem {II} were
	measured as a function of temperature and compared to those of chlorophyll
	a in Triton X-100. Two spectral species were found in the chlorophyll
	T-S spectra of CP47, which may arise from a difference in ligation
	of the pigments or from an additional hydrogen bond, similar to what
	has been found for Chl molecules in a variety of solvents. The T-S
	spectra show that the lowest lying state in CP47 is at approximately
	685 nm and gives rise to fluorescence at 690 nm at 4 K. The fluorescence
	quantum yield is 0.11 +/- 0.03 at 4 K, the chlorophyll triplet yield
	is 0.16 +/- 0.03. Carotenoid triplets are formed efficiently at 4
	K through triplet transfer from chlorophyll with a yield of 0.15
	+/- 0.02. The major decay channel of the lowest excited state in
	CP47 is internal conversion, with a quantum yield of about 0.58.
	Increase of the temperature results in a broadening and blue shift
	of the spectra due to the equilibration of the excitation over the
	antenna pigments. Upon increasing the temperature, a decrease of
	the fluorescence and triplet yields is observed to, at 270 K, a value
	of about 55% of the low temperature value. This decrease is significantly
	larger than of chlorophyll a in Triton X-100. Although the coupling
	to low-frequency phonon or vibration modes of the pigments is probably
	intermediate in CP47, the temperature dependence of the triplet and
	fluorescence quantum yield can be modeled using the energy gap law
	in the strong coupling limit of Englman and Jortner (1970. J. Mol.
	Phys. 18:145-164) for non-radiative decays. This yields for CP47
	an average frequency of the promoting/accepting modes of 350 cm-1
	with an activation energy of 650 cm-1 for internal conversion and
	activationless intersystem crossing to the triplet state through
	a promoting mode with a frequency of 180 cm-1. For chlorophyll a
	in Triton X-100 the average frequency of the promoting modes for
	non-radiative decay is very similar, but the activation energy (300
	cm-1) is significantly smaller. },

	in the wavelength range of 300-600 nm. Both time-gated spectra and
	single wavelength traces were measured. Global analysis of the data
	established that in the time domain between 5 ns and 2 s only two
	intermediates are involved in the room temperature photocycle of
	PYP, as has been proposed before (Meyer T.E., E. Yakali, M. A. Cusanovich,
	and G. Tollin. 1987. Biochemistry. 26:418-423; Meyer, T. E., G. Tollin,
	T. P. Causgrove, P. Cheng, and R. E. Blankenship. 1991. Biophys.
	J. 59:988-991). The first, red-shifted intermediate decays biexponentially
	(60% with tau = 0.25 ms and 40% with tau = 1.2 ms) to a blue-shifted
	intermediate. The last step of the photocycle is the biexponential
	(93% with tau = 0.15 s and 7% with tau = 2.0 s) recovery to the ground
	state of the protein. Reconstruction of the absolute spectra of these
	photointermediates yielded absorbance maxima of about 465 and 355
	nm for the red- and blue-shifted intermediate with an epsilon max
	at about 50% and 40% relative to the epsilon max of the ground state.
	The quantitative analysis of the photocycle in PYP described here
	paves the way to a detailed biophysical analysis of the processes
	occurring in this photoreceptor molecule. },

	folding and unfolding processes of a photoswitchable 16-residue alanine-based
	{alpha}-helical peptide on a timescale from few picoseconds to almost
	40 {micro}s and over a large temperature range (279-318 K). The folding
	and unfolding processes were triggered by an ultrafast laser pulse
	that isomerized the cross linker within a few picoseconds. The main
	folding and unfolding times (700 ns and 150 ns, respectively, at
	room temperature) are in line with previous T-jump experiments obtained
	from similar peptides. However, both processes show complex, strongly
	temperature-dependent spectral kinetics that deviate clearly from
	a single-exponential behavior. Whereas in the unfolding experiment
	the ensemble starts from a well defined folded state, the starting
	ensemble in the folding experiment is more heterogeneous, which leads
	to distinctly different kinetics of the experiments, because they
	are sensitive to different regions of the energy surface. A qualitative
	agreement with the experimental data-set can be obtained by a model
	where the unfolded states act as a hub connected to several separated
	"misfolded" states with a distribution of rates. We conclude that
	a rather large spread of rates (k1 : kn {approx} 9) is needed to
	explain the experimentally observed stretched exponential response
	with stretching factor {$\beta$} = 0.8 at 279 K. },

  abstract = {Profiles of lipid-water bilayer dynamics were determined from picosecond
	time-resolved fluorescence spectra of membrane-embedded BADAN-labeled
	M13 coat protein. For this purpose, the protein was labeled at seven
	key positions. This places the label at well-defined locations from
	the water phase to the center of the hydrophobic acyl chain region
	of a phospholipid model membrane, providing us with a nanoscale ruler
	to map membranes. Analysis of the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic
	data provides the characteristic time constant for the twisting motion
	of the BADAN label, which is sensitive to the local flexibility of
	the protein-lipid environment. In addition, we obtain information
	about the mobility of water molecules at the membrane-water interface.
	The results provide an unprecedented nanoscale profiling of the dynamics
	and distribution of water in membrane systems. This information gives
	clear evidence that the actual barrier of membranes for ions and
	aqueous solvents is located at the region of carbonyl groups of the
	acyl chains.}

	CP47. We have used time-resolved visible pump/midinfrared probe spectroscopy
	in the region between 1600 and 1800 cm1 to study the energy transfer
	and charge separation events within PSII cores. The absorption difference
	spectra in the region of the keto and ester chlorophyll modes show
	spectral evolution with time constants of 3 ps, 27 ps, 200 ps, and
	2 ns. Comparison of infrared (IR) difference spectra obtained for
	the isolated antennas CP43 and CP47 and the D1D2-RC with those measured
	for the PSII core allowed us to identify the features specific for
	each of the PSII core components. From the presence of the CP43 and
	CP47 specific features in the spectra up to time delays of 2030 ps,
	we conclude that the main part of the energy transfer from the antennas
	to the RC occurs on this timescale. Direct excitation of the pigments
	in the RC evolution associated difference spectra to radical pair
	formation of [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"> on the same timescale
	as multi-excitation annihilation and excited state equilibration
	within the antennas CP43 and CP47, which occur within [~]13 ps. The

	BORDER="0"> as identified in isolated D1D2 complexes with time-resolved
	mid-IR spectroscopy is not observed in the current data, probably
	because of its relatively low concentration. Relaxation of the state
	[IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"> caused by a drop in free energy,
	occurs in 200 ps in closed cores. We conclude that the kinetic model
	proposed earlier for the energy and electron transfer dynamics within
	the D1D2-RC, plus two slowly energy-transferring antennas C43 and
	CP47 explain the complex excited state and charge separation dynamics
	in the PSII core very well. We further show that the time-resolved
	IR-difference spectrum of [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">
	as observed in PSII cores is virtually identical to that observed
	in the isolated D1D2-RC complex of PSII, demonstrating that the local

  abstract = {Charge separation is an essential step in the conversion of solar
	energy into chemical energy in photosynthesis. To investigate this
	process, we performed transient absorption experiments at 77 K with
	various excitation conditions on the isolated Photosystem II reaction
	center preparations from spinach. The results have been analyzed
	by global and target analysis and demonstrate that at least two different
	excited states, (Chl(D1)Phe(D1))* and (P(D1)P(D2)Chl(D1))*, give
	rise to two different pathways for ultrafast charge separation. We
	propose that the disorder produced by slow protein motions causes
	energetic differentiation among reaction center complexes, leading
	to different charge separation pathways. Because of the low temperature,
	two excitation energy trap states are also present, generating charge-separated
	states on long time scales. We conclude that these slow trap states
	are the same as the excited states that lead to ultrafast charge
	separation, indicating that at 77 K charge separation can be either
	activation-less and last or activated and slow.}

  abstract = {Proteorhodopsin is an ion-translocating member of the microbial rhodopsin
	family. Light absorption by its retinal chromophore initiates a photocycle,
	driven by trans/cis isomerization, leading to transmembrane translocation
	of a proton toward the extracellular side of the cytoplasmic membrane.
	Here we report a study on the photoisomerization dynamics of the
	retinal chromophore of proteorhodopsin, using femtosecond time-resolved
	spectroscopy, by probing in the visible- and in the midinfrared spectral
	regions. Experiments were performed both at pH 9.5 (a physiologically
	relevant pH value in which the primary proton acceptor of the protonated
	Schiff base, Asp97, is deprotonated) and at pH 6.5 (with Asp97 protonated).
	Simultaneous analysis of the data sets recorded in the two spectral
	regions and at both pH values reveals a multiexponential excited
	state decay, with time constants of [~]0.2 ps, [~]2 ps, and [~]20
	ps. From the difference spectra associated with these dynamics, we
	conclude that there are two chromophore-isomerizaton pathways that
	lead to the K-state: one with an effective rate of [~](2 ps)-1 and
	the other with a rate of [~](20 ps)-1. At high pH, both pathways
	are equally effective, with an estimated quantum yield for K-formation
	of [~]0.7. At pH 6.5, the slower pathway is less productive, which
	results in an isomerization quantum yield of 0.5. We further observe
	an ultrafast response of residue Asp227, which forms part of the
	counterion complex, corresponding to a strengthening of its hydrogen
	bond with the Schiff base on K-state formation; and a feature that
	develops on the 0.2 ps and 2 ps timescale and probably reflects a
	response of an amide {II} band in reaction to the isomerization process.

	that Occurs via a set of spectroscopically distinct intermediate
	states and is initiated from the excited state of PChlide. To obtain
	a better understanding of these catalytic events, we characterized
	the excited state dynamics of PChlide in the solvents tetrahydrofuran
	(THF), methanol, and Tris/Triton buffer using ultrafast transient
	absorption in the visible and mid-infrared spectral regions and time-resolved
	fluorescence emission experiments. For comparison, we present time-resolved
	transient absorption measurements of chlorophyll a in THE From the
	combined analysis of these experiments, we derive that during the
	2-3 ns excited state lifetime an extensive multiphasic quenching
	of the emission occurs due to solvation of the excited state, which
	is in agreement with the previously proposed internal charge transfer
	(ICT) character of the S I state (Zhao, G. J.; Han, K. L. Biophys.
	J. 2008, 94, 38). The solvation process in methanol occurs in conjunction
	with a strengthening of a hydrogen bond to the Pchlide keto carbonyl
	group. We demonstrate that the internal conversion from the S2 to
	S1 excited states is remarkably slow and stretches out on to the
	700 fs time scale, causing a rise of blue-shifted signals in the
	transient absorption and a gain of emission in the time-resolved
	fluorescence. A triplet state is populated oil the nanosecond time
	scale with a maximal yield of similar to 23%. The consequences of
	these observations for the catalytic pathway and the role of the
	triplet and ICT state in activation of the enzyme are discussed.}

	were engineered for use as a near-infrared fluorescent marker in
	mammalian tissues (Tsien and co-workers, Science, 2009, 324, 804-807).
	Here, we report the fluorescence quantum yield and photochemistry
	of two highly-related Bphs from Rps. palustris, RpBphP2 (P2) and
	RpBphP3 (P3) with distinct photoconversion and fluorescence properties.
	We applied ultrafast spectroscopy to wild type P3 and P2 PAS-GAF
	proteins and their P3 D216A, Y272F and P2 D202A PAS-GAF-PHY mutant
	proteins. In these mutants hydrogen-bond interactions between a conserved
	aspartate (Asp) which connects the BV chromophore with the PHY domains
	are disrupted. The excited-state lifetime of the truncated P3 and
	P2 PAS-GAF proteins was significantly longer than in their PAS-GAF-PHY

	of the conserved Asp to Ala in the PAS-GAF-PHY protein had a similar

	and similar to the engineered Bph of Tsien and co-workers. We conclude
	that elimination of a key hydrogen-bond interaction between Asp and
	a conserved Arg in the PHY domain is responsible for the excited-state
	lifetime increase in all Bph variants studied here. H/D exchange
	resulted in a 1.4-1.7 fold increase of excited-state lifetime. The
	results support a reaction model in which deactivation of the BV
	chromophore proceeds via excited-state proton transfer from the BV
	pyrrole nitrogens to the backbone of the conserved Asp or to a bound

  abstract = {Phytochromes are red-light photoreceptor proteins that regulate a
	variety of responses and cellular processes in plants, bacteria,
	and fungi. Thephytochromelight activation mechanism involves isomerization
	around the C15=C16 double bond of an open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophore,
	resulting in a flip of its D-ring. In an important new development,
	bacteriophytochrome (Bph) has been engineered for use as a fluorescent
	marker in mammalian tissues. Here we report that an unusual Bph,
	RpBphP3 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, denoted P3, is fluorescent.
	This Bph modulates synthesis of light-harvesting complex in combination
	with a second Bph exhibiting classical photochemistry, RpBphP2, denoted
	P2. We identify the factors that determine the fluorescence and isomerization
	quantum yields through the application of ultrafast spectroscopy
	to wild-type and mutants of P2 and P3. The excited-state lifetime
	of the biliverdin chromophore in P3 was significantly longer at 330-500
	ps than in P2 and other classical phytochromes and accompanied by
	a significantly reduced isomerization quantum yield. H/D exchange
	reduces the rate of decay from the excited state of biliverdin by
	a factor of 1.4 and increases the isomerization quantum yield. Comparison
	of the properties of the P2 and P3 variants shows that the quantum
	yields of fluorescence and isomerization are determined by excited-state
	deprotonation of biliverdin at the pyrrole rings, in competition
	with hydrogen-bond rupture between the D-ring and the apoprotein.
	This work provides a basis for structure-based conversion of Bph
	into an efficient near-IR fluorescent marker.}

  abstract = {The flavoprotein AppA from Rhodobacter sphaeroides contains an N-terminal,
	FAD-binding BLUF photoreceptor domain. Upon illumination, the AppA
	BLUF domain forms a signaling state that is characterized by red-shifted
	absorbance by 10 nm, a state known as AppARED. We have applied ultrafast
	spectroscopy on the photoaccumulated AppARED state to investigate
	the photoreversible properties of the AppA BLUF domain. On light
	absorption by AppARED, the FAD singlet excited state FADRED* decays
	monoexponentially in 7 ps to form the neutral semiquinone radical
	FADH*, which subsequently decays to the original AppARED molecular
	ground state in 60 ps. Thus, FADRED* is deactivated rapidly via electron
	and proton transfer, probably from the conserved tyrosine Tyr-21
	to FAD, followed by radical-pair recombination. We conclude that,
	in contrast to many other photoreceptors, the AppA BLUF domain is
	not photoreversible and does not enter alternative reaction pathways
	upon absorption of a second photon. To explain these properties,
	we propose that a molecular configuration is formed upon excitation
	of AppARED that corresponds to a forward reaction intermediate previously
	identified for the dark-state BLUF photoreaction. Upon excitation
	of AppARED, the BLUF domain therefore enters its forward reaction
	coordinate, readily re-forming the AppARED ground state and suppressing
	reverse or side reactions. The monoexponential decay of FAD* indicates
	that the FAD-binding pocket in AppARED is significantly more rigid
	than in dark-state AppA. Steady-state fluorescence experiments on
	wild-type, W104F, and W64F mutant BLUF domains show tryptophan fluorescence
	maxima that correspond with a buried conformation of Trp-104 in dark
	and light states. We conclude that Trp-104 does not become exposed
	to solvent during the BLUF photocycle. },

	By kinetic modeling of the fluorescence data on chlorophyll and phycocyanin
	645 excitation (at 400 and 582 nm respectively), it has been possible
	to show the excited state energy distribution in the photosynthetic
	antenna of this alga. Excitation energy from phycocyanin 645 is distributed
	nearly equally between photosystem I and photosystem {II} with very
	high efficiency on a 100-ps timescale. The excitation energy trapping
	times for both photosystem I ([~]30 ps) and photosystem I (200 and
	[~]540 ps) correspond well to those obtained from experiments on
	isolated photosystems. The results are compared with previous results
	for another cryptophyte species, Rhodomonas CS24, and suggest a similar

	tightly packed in the thylakoid lumen around the periphery of the

Abstract = {{X-ray structures of the Photosystem II (PSII) core revealed relatively
   large interpigment distances between the CP43 and CP47 antenna compleyes
   and the reaction center (RC) with respect to the interpigment distances
   in a single unit. This finding questions the possibility of fast energy
   equilibration among the antenna and the RC, which has been the basic
   explanation for the measured PSII fluorescence kinetics for more than
   two decades. In this study, we present time-resolved fluorescence
   measurements obtained with a streak-camera setup on PSH core complexes
   from Thermosynechococcus elongatus at room temperature (RT) and at 77 K.
   Kinetic modeling of the RT data obtained with oxidized quinone acceptor
   Q(A) reveals that the kinetics are best described by fast primary charge
   separation at a time scale of 1.5 ps and slow energy transfer from the
   antenna into the RC, which results in an energy equilibration time
   between the antenna and the RC of about 44 ps. This model is consistent
   with structure-based computations. Primary radical pair formation was
   found to be a virtually irreversible process. Energy equilibration
   within the CP43 and CP47 complexes is shown to occur at a time scale of
   8 ps. Kinetic modeling of the 77K data reveals similar energy transfer
   time scales in the antenna units and among the antenna and the RC as at
   RT, respectively, 7 and 37 ps. We conclude that the energy transfer from
   the CP43/CP47 antenna to; the RC is the dominant factor in the total
   charge separation kinetics in intact PSII cores.}},
