		  Maybe surprisingly, many studies show that the brain
		  manipulates these forms of uncertainty in a
		  probabilistically consistent and normative manner, and
		  there is now a rich theoretical literature on the
		  capabilities of populations of neurons to implement
		  computations in the face of uncertainty. However, one major
		  facet of uncertainty has received comparatively little
		  attention: time. In a dynamic, rapidly changing world, data
		  are only temporarily relevant. Here, we analyze the
		  computational consequences of encoding stimulus
		  trajectories in populations of neurons. For the most
		  obvious, simple, instantaneous encoder, the correlations
		  induced by natural, smooth stimuli engender a decoder that
		  requires access to information that is nonlocal both in
		  time and across neurons. This formally amounts to a ruinous
		  representation. We show that there is an alternative
		  encoder that is computationally and representationally
		  powerful in which each spike contributes independent
		  information; it is independently decodable, in other words.
		  We suggest this as an appropriate foundation for
		  understanding time-varying population codes. Furthermore,

  abstract	= {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized
		  macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly
		  from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or
		  patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple,
		  complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very
		  similar to those previously described in the cat. On the
		  average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there
		  is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus
		  orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour
		  coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent
		  systems of columns extending vertically from surface to
		  white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with
		  common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to
		  the orientation columns described in the cat, but are
		  probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second
		  system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye
		  preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than
		  the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries
		  seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to
		  be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement;
		  in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two
		  opposite directions of movement of a line, but other
		  regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction
		  and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization
		  corresponding to the cortical layering can also be
		  discerned. The upper layers {(II} and the upper two-thirds
		  of {III)} contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but
		  simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly
		  binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer
		  {III,} and in {IV} A and {IV} B. In layer {IV} B they form
		  a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells
		  are rare. In layers {IV} A and {IV} B one finds units
		  lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether
		  these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In
		  layer {IV} most cells are driven by one eye only; this
		  layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions
		  responding to one eye only, those of other regions
		  responding to the other eye. Layers V and {VI} contain
		  mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly
		  driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized
		  vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In
		  the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical
		  line in the cortex have common features) stimulus
		  dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation,
		  ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement,
		  are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics.
		  The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by
		  hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells
		  monocularly driven) located in and near layer {IV,} the
		  higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

		  The selectivity of visual cortical neurons to orientation,

		  understood in terms of simple linear filter models, albeit
		  with some minor nonlinearities such as thresholding and

		  such as contrast envelopes, illusory contours, or texture
		  borders. Second-order stimuli constructed from sinusoidal
		  components have been used to analyze the neurophysiological
		  mechanisms of such responses; these experiments demonstrate
		  that the same neuron can exhibit three distinct kinds of
		  tuning to spatial frequency, and also to orientation. These
		  results can be understood in terms of a type of nonlinear

		  Finally, several general issues will be discussed,

		  A significant increase in bursting was observed during

		  specific stimulus events consisting of a prolonged
		  inhibitory stimulus, followed by an excitatory stimulus,

		  {LGN} responses to natural scene movies were predicted

		  model successfully predicted {LGN} responses to natural

		  We investigated whether neural responses carry information
		  about how local features belong to objects. Single-cell
		  activity was recorded in areas V1, V2, and V4 of awake
		  behaving monkeys. Displays were used in which the same
		  local feature (contrast edge or line) could be presented as

		  edge could be the left side of a dark square or the right
		  side of a light square. Each display was also presented
		  with reversed contrast. We found significant modulation of
		  responses as a function of the side of the figure in
		  {\textgreater}50\% of neurons of V2 and V4 and in 18\% of
		  neurons of the top layers of V1. Thus, besides the local
		  contrast border information, neurons were found to encode
		  the side to which the border belongs ("border ownership
		  coding"). A majority of these neurons coded border
		  ownership and the local polarity of luminance-chromaticity
		  contrast. The others were insensitive to contrast polarity.
		  Another 20\% of the neurons of V2 and V4, and 48\% of top
		  layer V1, coded local contrast polarity, but not border

		  be nearly independent of figure size up to the limit set by
		  the size of our display (21 degrees ). Displays that
		  differed only far outside the conventional receptive field
		  could produce markedly different responses. When tested
		  with more complex displays in which figure-ground cues were
		  varied, some neurons produced invariant border ownership
		  signals, others failed to signal border ownership for some
		  of the displays, but neurons that reversed signals were
		  rare. The influence of visual stimulation far from the

		  fit nonlinear receptive field models using each of these

  abstract	= {Neurons in the central auditory system are often described
		  by the spectrotemporal receptive field {(STRF),}
		  conventionally defined as the best linear fit between the
		  spectrogram of a sound and the spike rate it evokes. An
		  {STRF} is often assumed to provide an estimate of the
		  receptive field of a neuron, i.e., the spectral and
		  temporal range of stimuli that affect the response.
		  However, when the true stimulus-response function is
		  nonlinear, the {STRF} will be stimulus dependent, and
		  changes in the stimulus properties can alter estimates of
		  the sign and spectrotemporal extent of receptive field
		  components. We demonstrate analytically and in simulations

		  between simple neuronal nonlinearities and higher-order
		  structure in the stimulus can produce {STRFs} that show
		  contributions from time-frequency combinations to which the

		  independent stimuli are used does the {STRF} reliably
		  indicate features of the underlying receptive field, and

		  consequence of these observations, illustrated using
		  natural stimuli, is that a stimulus-induced change in an
		  {STRF} could arise from a consistent but nonlinear neuronal
		  response to stimulus ensembles with differing higher-order
		  dependencies. Thus, although the responses of higher
		  auditory neurons may well involve adaptation to the
		  statistics of different stimulus ensembles, stimulus
		  dependence of {STRFs} alone, or indeed of any overly
		  constrained stimulus-response mapping, cannot demonstrate

		  criteria for {2D} Gabor image representations are important
		  because of their increasing role in many computer vision

		  recent neurophysiological evidence from the visual cortex
		  of mammalian brains suggests that the filter response

		  neurons (called simple cells) are best modeled as a family
		  of self-similar {2D} Gabor wavelets. We therefore derive
		  the conditions under which a set of continuous {2D} Gabor

		  parameterizations which allow stable reconstruction by
