  abstract = {Architectural description languages (ADLs) are essential means for	
			a system and software design in the large. Their common concepts
			are components, ports, interfaces and connectors. Some of them already
			support the representation and management of variance, a prerequisite
			to support product line engineering, but the support of variability
			often stops on component level. In this paper, a more detailed view
			on the integration of variability into architectural models concerning
			the formal analysis of variability and the related assessment of
			the defined product lines is taken. The focus is set on the support
			of product line engineering within the automotive E/E domain, where
			functionality or its realization is varying according to specific
			customer needs and hardware topologies. In general, the fundamental
			question in this domain is not, if a product line approach is applied,
			but what is the best way to integrate it.},
