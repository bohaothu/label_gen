                 an in-coming stream of electronic documents, including
                 E-mail, newswire stories and NetNews articles. The
                 system implements a novel mechanism for collaborative
                 filtering in which users annotate documents before the
                 documents art filtered. Because annotations are not
                 available at the time a new document arrives, the
                 system supports continuous queries that examine the
                 entire database of documents and take into account
                 newly introduced annotations during the filtering
                 process.",
