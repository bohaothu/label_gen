The objective of this paper is an investigation of the applicability of information extraction techniques in real-world business applications dealing with textual data since business relevant data is mainly transmitted through free-text documents. Further, we demonstrate an enormous indexing potential of lightweight linguistic text processing techniques applied in information extraction systems in other closely related fields of information technology which concern processing vast amounts of textual data.},

   Abstract = {We introduce a facial animation system that produces real-time animation sequences including speech synchronization and non-verbal speech-related facial expressions from plain text input. A state-of-the-art text-to-speech synthesis component performs linguistic analysis of the text input and creates a speech signal from phonetic and intonation information. The phonetic transcription is additionally used to drive a speech synchronization method for the physically based facial animation. Further high-level information from the linguistic analysis such as different types of accents or pauses as well as the type of the sentence is used to generate non-verbal speech-related facial expressions such as movement of head, eyes, and eyebrows or voluntary eye blinks. Moreover, emoticons are translated into XML markup that triggers emotional facial expressions.},

The modularity is made possible by a separation of the parsing strategy from the mechanism of tabulation. The parsing strategy is expressed in terms of the construction of a nondeterministic automaton from a grammar; three distinct types of automaton will be discussed. The mechanism of tabulation leads to the simulation of these nondeterministic automata in polynomial time, independent of the parsing strategy. The proposed application of this work is the design of efficient parsing algorithms for tree-adjoining grammars and related formalisms.},

The work was carried out jointly by SICS and SRI Cambridge. The resulting prototype system (called Bilingual Conversation Interpreter, or BCI) translates between English and Swedish in both directions. The major components of the BCI are two copies of the SRI Core Language Engine, equipped with English and Swedish grammars respectively. These are linked by the transfer and disambiguation components. Translation takes place by analyzing the source-language sentence into Quasi Logical Form (QLF), a linguistically motivated logical representation, transferring this into a target-language QLF, and generating a targetlanguage sentence. When ambiguities occur that cannot be resolved automatically, they are clarified by querying the appropriate user. The clarification dialogue presupposes no knowledge of either linguistics or the other language. The prototype system has a broad grammatical coverage, a initial vocabulary of about 1000 words together with vocabulary expansion tools, and a set of English-Swedish transfer rules. The formalisms developed for coding this linguistic information make it relatively easy to extend the system. We believe that the project was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of using these techniques for interactive translation applications, and provides a sound basis for development of a large scale message translator system with potential for commercial exploitation.},

   Title = {Sentence Mode and Emotional Load in Bulgarian: Economy of Intonational Form?},
   BookTitle = {Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Laboratory Phonology (LabPhon7), June 29 -July 1},
   Address= {Nijmegen, Netherlands},
   Abstract = {An earlier study [1] illuminated the role of F0 contours on the focus accent in differentiating question and sentence mode in the Sofia variety of Bulgarian.The results showed that placement of the low target of the pitch accent at the beginning and the peak at the end of the accented syllable or in the following syllable (L*+H) is critical for the perception of (syntactically and lexically unmarked) checks, which are used to confirm already known information [2]. By shifting the peak leftwards towards the beginning of the accented syllable (H*) the pragmatic category changed from check to statement. Both categories have a L% boundary tone. 

However, subjects' judgements indicated that the strength of the intonational information was not equal for the two utterance types. The situational pre-context had a strong influence on the interpretation of the utterance as a check or statement. In case the intonation contour diverged from the unmarked contour for a particular function, the category judgement was accompanied by a change in the emotional message. 

To examine the general validity of these observations a further experiment was carried out. Three checks, three statements with low terminal boundary tones (L%), and three statements with continuation rises (H%) were selected from Map Task recordings made for a number of male and female speakers [3]. From each of these 9 natural utterances three intonational variants were generated, one for each pragmatic category. Firstly, a stylised resynthesized version of the original (e.g. a check) was produced. Then the intonation contours for the other two pragmatic categories (e.g. statement with terminal fall and continuation rise) were derived from the stylised contour. 

Four repetitions of the stimuli were presented (Roman square design) to 15 native speakers of Sofia Bulgarian in three situational contexts: question, neutral statement and polite statement. The context utterance together with the stimulus form a minimal dialogue. The natural context for the check was a statement, and for the two statement forms it was a question. In the test, each context was offered with each pragmatic category, producing potential tension between context and stimulus. The subjects were required to judge - on a five-point scale - the degree to which each stimulus was suited to its context. 

The results show that all three intonational contours can be accepted as statements in the context of a preceding question, whereas the change of context cannot shift the interpretation of a statement to a check. The following explanation can be offered for this asymmetry of reinterpretation. 

The context plays an extremely important role for the interpretation of checks or statements. The context priming a statement (question-answer sequence) provides enough information to uniquely specify the communicative frame. It is a strong enough speech act marker to relegate function of the intonational form to a minor one. Thus the context weakens the distinctive function that intonation has when word sequence and syntactic structure are identical.This does not, however, mean that the intonational form is irrelevant. The shift in the interpretation of the sentence mode (check to statement) can only occur because a compensatory change of modal meaning accompanies it. The check contour cannot be accepted as a neutral statement, it can only be accepted as an emphatic, impatient or angry statement. The statements with a continuation rise were also accepted in the statement context, but the compensatory modal message was of an exaggeratedly polite speaker. 

Apparently, when a typical (neutral) feature of a particular communicative situation is replaced by a feature typical of another situation, it introduces an additional modal marking. Thus intonation alone, without syntactic and lexical support, can imply a certain shade of modal meaning. This phenomenon is already known at the grammatical level. In Bulgarian, for example, the future tense is the neutral form for referring to events in the future. If the present tense is used, the utterance is immediately modally marked as a firm intention. In English and German the reverse is true.},

   Abstract = {Hybrid languages are extended modal languages which can refer to (or even quantify over) worlds. The use of strong hybrid languages dates back to at least 1967 (in the work of Arthur Prior), but recent work has focussed on more constrained systems. The purpose of the present paper is to examine one such system in detail. We begin by studying its expressivity, and provide both model theoretic characterizations (via a restricted notion of Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game, and an enriched notion of bisimulation) and a syntactic characterization (in terms of bounded formulas). The key result to emerge is that the system corresponds precisely to the first-order fragment which is invariant for generated submodels. We further establish that it has (strong) interpolation, and provide failure results in the finite variable fragments. We also show that weak interpolation holds for an important sublanguage and provide complexity results for this sublanguage and other fragments and variants (the full logic being undecidable).},

The fairly rich verbal conjugation system with complex analytic verb forms, and the well-developed mechanism of "clitic replication" (also referred to in the literature as "pronominal reprise", "clitic doubling", etc.) are specific properties of this language. This paper concentrates on structural distinguishing of two word order domains in the Bulgarian clause - the morphosyntactic one of the verb complex and the syntactic one of the verb and its modifiers within the clause.

We then define a binding theory for Czech which differs from HPSG binding theory in two main points. First, it is based on an ordering (the D-ordering) which is more general than HPSG's obliqueness ordering -- this permits a natural treatment of adjuncts. Second, it distinguishes between reflexives and reciprocals and submits them to different binding constraints. Finally, we provide a semantics for reciprocals with summated antecedents.},

   Abstract = {In this article we wish to concentrate on a non-transformational description of the structure of complex verb forms in Modern Bulgarian, Slavonic language performing some Balkanic features in its morphology and syntax, which makes it differ considerably from other languages of the Slavonic group. Almost no such attempts have been made before, although some of the syntactic problems that arise have been mentioned and treated from different viewpoints in studies concerned with complex tenses, with voice and mood, with the status of pronouns, of negative and interrogative particles etc. The partially free word order of Bulgarian has been mentioned in very few works based on the transformational approach. 

For the sake of description of the Bulgarian verb complex, we felt we had to refrain from some of the standards of the linguistic background of many current non-transformational (as well as other) approaches. The changes we introduced concern the constituent structures used and they consist inriching the established approach with ideas stemming from the works of the Prague Linguistic School, namely with the notion of communicative dynamism. The shape of the structures is briefly sketched in the first part of the work, while the linguistic facts and their description are the main content of its second part; in the closing paragraphs, some phenomena are mentioned which were not examined in detail in the central sections of the work and their incorporation into the description as presented before is considered.},

   Month= {December},
   Abstract = {Our main goal is to propose a unified analysis of the "second position" and Wackernagel phenomena, which would adequately accommodate also certain non-trivial data that seem to be problematic for the currently available approaches: 

1. Correct sentences with multiple syntactic constituents preceding the sentential clitics in Czech, and respectively, multiple syntactic constituency in the German "Vorfeld": 
a. Czech clitics (respectively, the tensed verb in German main clauses) preceded by two or more adverbials describing together a spatial or temporal interval; 
b. Czech clitics (respectively, the tensed verb in German main clauses) preceded by two or more adverbials of the same type, which can be viewed as a repetition of the respective modification; 
c. Czech clitics (respectively, the tensed verb in German main clauses) preceded by a combination of a temporal and a local adverbial; 
d. Czech clitics (respectively, the tensed verb in German main clauses) preceded by more than one contrasted syntactic constituents 
2. Sentences with a single constituent preceding the sentential clitics (respectively, single constituent in the "Vorfeld") but judged to be highly unacceptable . 
We reconsider the Prague School treatment of the communicative structure of the sentence, and assume that, for each particular utterance, it can be determined which of the contained elements are informationally essential (significant) - i.e. informationally indispensable from a communicative perspective - and which of them are informationally unessential (insignificant) - i.e. without actual communicative contribution - and occur in the utterance for other, e.g., structural, pleonastic etc., reasons only. On such a basis we (re)introduce the notion of communicative importance. We further assume that not all elements of an utterance can be assigned a degree of communicative dynamism - i.e. that there are items for which the feature communicative importance is inappropriate. Another assumption is that in an utterance there might exist two or more syntactically distinguishable constituents which are of equal communicative importance. 
After these modifications, we introduce a structuring of an utterance into communicative units which we tentatively call communicative segments. A substantial communicative segment is defined as a contiguous sequence of adjacent syntactic units (i.e. words or phrases) of equal communicative importance, while an auxiliary communicative segment is a contiguous sequence of informationally insignificant items for which communicative importance is inappropriate as a feature. From such a perspective the Wackernagel's clitic cluster in Czech is regarded as an instance of an auxiliary communicative segment. We further define the "second" / Wackernagel position as the position delimiting the first (leftmost) substantial communicative segment in an utterance, and thus propose an alternative treatment also of the German "Vorfeld". 

Inasmuch as there are language-specific constraints on what can form a substantial communicative segment, our analysis allows for a natural explanation also of, e.g., the "constituent-second" / "word-second" position of Serbo-Croatian clitics.},

   Abstract = {Sharing portions of grammars across languages greatly reduces the costs of multilingual grammar engineering. Related languages share a much wider range of linguistic information than typically assumed in standard multilingual grammar architectures. Taking grammatical relatedness seriously, we are particularly interested in designing linguistically motivated grammatical resources for Slavic languages to be used in applied and theoretical computational linguistics. In order to gain the perspective of a languagefamily oriented grammar design, we consider an array of systematic relations that can hold between syntactical units. While the categorisation of primitive linguistic entities tends to be languagespecific or even constructionspecific, the relations holding between them allow various degrees of abstraction. On the basis of Slavic data, we show how a domain ontology conceptualising morphosyntactic "building blocks" can serve as a basis of a shared grammar of Slavic.},

   Abstract = {In der Entwicklung der Informationstechnologie wird die natürliche Sprache zu einem unentbehrlichen Medium für die Kommunikation zwischen Menschen und ihren autonomen maschinellen Partnern (Agenten). Im Projekt DISCO wurde ein Dialogsystem entwickelt, das maschinelle Dialogpartner in die Lage versetzt, mit ihren menschlichen Partnern in natürlicher Sprache zu kommunizieren. Während existierende Dialogsysteme zur Kommunikation zwischen der Maschine und einem einzigen menschlichen Benutzer gedacht sind, nimmt das DISCO-System an Dialogen zwischen mehr als zwei Teilnehmern teil. Die autonomen kooperierenden Agenten, für die das DISCO-System geschaffen wurde, sind KISoftwaresysteme auf vernetzten Computern.
DlSCO führte Forschung sowohl in Computerlinguistik als auch in anderen Gebieten der KI durch. Frühere Arbeiten an natürlichsprachlichen Dialogsystemen konzentrierten sich entweder auf moderne Methoden für die linguistische Spezifikation und die Sprachverarbeitung oder auf fortgeschrittene Dialogverarbeitung. Im Unterschied dazu konnte DISCO erfolgreich Resultate aus beiden Gebieten integrieren. Als Ergebnis erhielt das DFKI ein auf modernsten Technologien aufbauendes, umfangreiches, flexibles, erweiterbares natürlichsprachliches Kernsystem, das für eine Vielzahl von Anwendungsentwicklungen eingesetzt werden kann und bereits in mehreren anderen Projekten eingesetzt wird.},

   Abstract = {TDL is a typed feature-based language specifically designed to support highly lexicalized grammar theories like HPSG, FUG, or CUG. TDL offers the possibility to define (possibly recursive) types, consisting of type constraints and feature constraints over the standard connectives AND, OR, and NOT, where the types are arranged in a subsumption hierarchy. TDL distinguishes between AVM types (open-world reasoning) and SORT types (closed-world reasoning) and allows the declaration of partitions and incompatible types. Working with partially as well as with fully expanded types is possible, both at definition and at run time. TDL is incremental, i.e., it allows the redefinition of types and the use of undefined types.},

Starting with some notes on the Working Group, we will describe objectives, organization, and results of the workshop. We also summarize some relevant general findings as they emerged from the final discussion. The system demonstrated are described in a detailed synopsis. In order to facilitate comparison, a standardized questionnaire was used for the individual descriptions. The questionnaires were filled out by the developers. Since there might always be relevant pieces of information that do not fit well in such a questionnaire, the developers could also provide a short prose description. Most developers took advantage of this opportunity and attached a brief summary of their system.},

The tsnlp (Test Suites for Natural Language Processing) project (1) has investigated various aspects of the construction, maintenance and application of systematic test suites as diagnostic and evaluation tools for NLP applications. The paper summarizes the motivation and main results of tsnlp: besides the solid methodological foundation of the project, tsnlp has produced substantial (i.e. larger than any existing general test suites) multi-purpose and multi-user test suites for three European languages together with a set of specialized tools that facilitate the construction, extension, maintenance, retrieval, and customization of the test data. The publicly available results of tsnlp represent a valuable linguistic resource that has the potential of providing a wide-spread pre-standard diagnostic and evaluation tool for both developers and users of NLP applications.},

   Abstract = {Speech production behaviour for cases where, in German, the assumed syllable structure demands of the Maximum Onset Principle (MOP) and the shortstressed vowel Compulsory Coda Principle (CCP) are in conflict, is compared with cases where there is no conflict. The results of two word manipulation tasks are presented in which subjects were required to divide firstsyllablestressed disyllabic words into two parts, in one case ("scanning") introducing a pause between the first and second part, in the other case ("swapping") speaking the parts in reverse order. Production of an intervocalic single consonant both as a coda to the (original) first syllable and as an onset to the (original) second syllable is seen as behavioural evidence for the psychological reality of ambisyllabicity, which, as a theoretical construct, resolves the conflict in syllable structure demands. We also discuss the relation of the results to orthographic and taskrelated factors and their implication for the phonological status of the syllable.},

Eine  Untersuchung  der  Produktion  dieser Opposition bei den Plosiven und ein Perzeptionstest mit manipulierten Stimuli aus dem Produktionskorpus wurden mit Dialektsprechern und -hörern aus zwei moselfränkischen  und  zwei  rheinfränkischen  Orten  durchgeführt.  Die  Ergebnisse zeigen, daß trotz gruppenmäßig- und individuell systematischer Produktionsunterschiede für beide Gruppen die Plosivlösung das stärkste Signal für die perzeptorische Unterscheidung ist. Eine unterschiedliche Tendenz bei den Hörergruppen  bezüglich  der  Gewichtung  unterschiedlicher  Lösungsintensitäten bei  kurzer  Lösungsdauer  entspricht  der  in  der  Dialektliteratur  gefundenen Transkriptionsvariation.},

Of particular interest is the question whether there is a correspondence between the phonetic form of an accent a speaker assigns to a constituent (low or high pitch accent) and the constituent's assumed activation state in the addressee's consciousness (given or new) at the time of utterance.},

   Abstract = {We present a new approach to topological parsing for German which is corpus-based, and built on a simple model of probabilistic CFG parsing. The topological field model is a theory-neutral model of clausal syntax that provides a linguistically motivated, but flat macro structure for complex sentences. Topological structures are highly compatible with deep syntactic analysis, thus perfectly suited for seamless integration of shallow and deep NLP. Besides the practical aspect of developing a robust and accurate topological parser, we investigate to what extent topological structures can be handled by context-free probabilistic models, while trying to detect specific phenomena that require more sophisticated models. We discuss experiments with systematic variants of a topological treebank grammar, which yield competitive results.},

   Abstract = {This workshop is, to our knowledge, the first one topicalizing the relation between application tasks and technologies used. It aims at exploring the tension between more general and more specific approaches to NLG, thereby clarifying what NLG technology is suited best for which task. It is intended to be an opportunity to get an overview over existing state-of-the-art technology and its optimal usage. It will be relevant for both developers and users of NLG systems. Exploring conditions for successful NLG applications is a step that should be taken jointly by technology providers and current and potential users of NLG software. The invited speaker, Paul Heisterkamp of DaimlerChrysler AG, will focus on the industrial usage of NLG software, and we appreciate his contribution to this volume. 
The workshop is embedded into the German Annual AI conference KI'99, following its tradition of hosting small hot-topic workshops. At the same time it is an activity of the Special Interest Group for Natural Language Systems (Fachgruppe 1.3.1) of the German association for computer science, Gesellschaft für Informatik (GI). 
The ten contributions to this volume are unpublished research reports reviewed by the workshop organizers. The authors agreed to make available to each other the submitted papers before preparing the final versions.

Grammar and formalism features which make the experiment feasible are described. Successive models are evaluated on precision and recall of phrase markup consisting of labels for noun chunks and subcategorization frames. Our approach to parsing is a blend of symbolic and stochastic methods where we use evaluation results in both incremental grammar development and validation of selected output to be used in lexical semantic clustering. Our results are that (i) scrambling-style free phrase order, case morphology, subcategorization, and NP-internal gender, number and case agreement can be dealt within a lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar formalism, and (ii) inside-outside estimation appears to be beneficial, however relies on a carefully built grammar and an evaluation based on carefully selected linguistic criteria. Additionally, we report experiments on overtraining with inside-outside estimation, especially focusing on comparison of the results of mathematical and linguistic evaluations.},

   Abstract = {In der Sprachausgabe Logox wird SAMPA als Eingabeformat für die Aussprache benutzt. Durch die eher phonetische Orientierung an der Aussprache und einige Eigenschaften der Mikrosegmentsynthese wurden Anpassungen und Erweiterungen eingeführt. Z.B.: [(] als Zeichen für das kurze, ungespannte /E/, Klammerung () von Diphthongen und Affrikaten, "=" für silbische Konsonanten und unsilbische Vokale, [Sb] und [Sd] für unaspirierte Plosive nach /S/ am Wort- bzw. Silbenanfang. Die Aussprache von Wörtern, die auf "-ig" enden wird durch ein "Archiphonem" /G/ geregelt. Für potentiell intervokalische /r/ am Ende des Wortstammes wird [6r] transkribiert. So können durch systeminterne Umwandlungsregeln sowohl intervokalische als auch präkonsonantische /r/ korrekt ausgesprochen werden. Bezüglich der Realisierung der Phonemfolge /@r/ wurde ein Bewertungsexperiment mit folgendem Ergebnis durchgeführt: [6] wurde in den meisten Kontexten besser bewertet als [@]. Insbesondere im Folgen von unbetonten Silben, wenn der Wortstamm auf /@r/ endet (unabhängig von Betontheit der Folgesilbe) und in den Vorsilben "ver-", "zer-" und "er-". [@] wird eher erwartet in den Vorsilben "be-" und "ge-" und vor betonten Silben innerhalb eines Wortstamms. 

In the Logox Text-to-Speech system SAMPA is used as input format for the extension of the pronunciation lexicon. Due to certain features of the microsegment synthesis some adaptations and deviations from other SAMPA standards were necessary. The most important are: [\{]} as symbol for short, lax /E/, diphthongs and affricates are enclosed in brackets (), "=" is used for syllabic consonants and non-syllabic vowels, [Sb] and [Sd] for unaspirated plosives after /S/ word or syllable-initially. An "archiphoneme" /G/ controls the pronunciation of morphemes ending in "-ig". By transcribing [6r] system internal rules can be used to account for the different realisation of /r/ stem-finally in intervocalic and preconsonantal position. A perception experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the realisation of /@/ before /r/. Results indicate, that [6] is prefered over [@] especially in unstressed syllable sequences, in a stem ending in /@r/ regardless of stress of the following syllable, and in the prefixes "ver-", "zer-" and "er-". [@] is mostly preferred in the prefixes "be-" and "ge-" and in word stems before stressed syllables.},

Moreover, internalized labeled deduction links neatly with the Gabbay-style rules now widely used in modal Hilbert-systems, completeness results for a wide range of first-order definable frame classes can be obtained automatically, and the method extends straightforwardly to richer languages. The paper discusses related work by Jerry Seligman and Miroslava Tzakova and concludes with some reflections on the status of labeling in modal logic.},

   Abstract = {Combining logics has become a rapidly expanding enterprise that is inspired mainly by concerns about modularity and the wish to join together tailored made logical tools into more powerful but still manageable ones. 
A natural question is whether it offers anything new over and above existing standard languages. By analysing a number of applications where combined logics arise, we argue that combined logics are a potentially valuable tool in applied logic, and that endorsements of standard languages often miss the point. 
Using the history of quantified modal logic as our main example, we also show that the use of combined structures and logics is a recurring theme in the analysis of existing logical systems.},

   Abstract = {Our main aim is to review the frame semantics and axiomatics of modal logic from the perspective of the duality between (Kripke) frames and boolean algebras with operators as defined by Jónsson and Tarski. 

To this end, we introduce modal languages and their interpretation in models and frames in Part II. We define and discuss the notion of a modal formula characterizing a class of frames or models, and give the Sahlqvist algorithm which yields, given a suitable modal formula as input, the corresponding first-order condition on the class of frames characterized by the formula. We define the concept of a normal modal logic and explain the canonical frame method for proving completeness of a logic with respect to classes of frames. 

In Part III we develop the algebraic perspective on modal logic. We introduce boolean algebras with operators and show how they arise naturally in both the semantic and the axiomatic approach towards algebraizing modal logic. We discuss in detail how the category of boolean algebras with operators and homomorphisms links up with the category of frames with so-called bounded morphisms. Finally, we apply this duality to give easy proofs for some important and well-known results from modal logic.},

   Abstract = {Hybrid languages exhibit two kinds of hybridisation. First, they combine the distinguishing features of modal logic and classical logic: although they have a Kripke semantics, they also make use of explicit variables and quantifiers that bind them. Second, they don't draw a syntactic distinction between terms and formulas: terms are part of the formula algebra, thus enabling the free combination of two different types of information. 
The goals of this paper are to introduce a number of hybrid languages, to discuss some of their fundamental logical properties (expressivity, decidability, and undecidability), and then, brie to indicate why such systems deserve further attention. 
Although hybrid languages have a long and varied history, it is quite likely that most readers will know little, if anything, about them. This dictates the structure of this paper: before we can explain why we're interested in hybrid languages, we're going to have to explain what they are and give some insight into their capabilities, for only then will a discussion of broader motivational issues make much sense.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we discuss two hybrid languages, and provide them with complete axiomatizations. Both languages combine features of modal and classical logic. Like modal languages, they contain modal operators and have a Kripke semantics. Unlike modal languages, in these systems it is possible to 'label' states by using binders to bind special state variables. This paper explores the consequences of hybridization for completeness. As we shall show, the challenge is to blend the modal idea of canonical models with the classical idea of witnessed maximal consistent sets. The languages discussed provide us with two extreme examples of the issues involved. In the one case we can combine these ideas relatively straightforwardly with the aid of analogs of the Barcan axioms coupled with a modal theory of labeling. In the other case, although we can still formulate a theory of labeling, the Barcan analogs are not valid. We show how to overcome this difficulty by using COV, an infinite collection of additional rules of proof which has been used in a number of investigations of extended modal logic.},

Although developed in interesting ways by Robert Bull, and the Sofia school (notably, George Gargov, Valentin Goranko, Solomon Passy and Tinko Tinchev), the method remains little known. In our view this has deprived temporal logic of a valuable tool. The aim of the paper is to explain why hybridization is useful in temporal logic. We make two major points, the first technical, the second conceptual. Technically, we show that hybridization gives rise to well-behaved logics that exhibit an interesting synergy between modal and classical ideas. This synergy, obvious for hybrid languages with full first-order expressive strength, is demonstrated for three weaker local languages, all of which are capable of defining the Until operator; we provide simple minimal axiomatizations for all three systems, and show that in a wide range of temporally interesting cases, extended completeness results can be obtained automatically. Conceptually, we argue that the idea of sorted atomic symbols which underpins the hybrid enterprise can be developed much further. To illustrate this, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a simple hybrid language which can quantify over paths. This is the original version of a paper which was accepted for publication in a special issue of the Journal of the IGPL on temporal logic. Unfortunately, the length of the article meant that it had to be drastically cut, and only a shorter version will appear. While the short version covers one of the most elegant results (@-driven completeness results) and is slightly more up to date in certain respects, the long version is probably the most detailed discussion of the completeness theory of local hybrid languages around. The long version also contains many lengthy footnotes. These outline the history of hybrid languages in considerable detail, and contain many remarks on philosophical, methodological, and technical issues.},

   Abstract = {This paper shows how to increase the expressivity of concept languages using a strategy called hybridization. Building on the well-known correspondences between modal and description logics, two hybrid languages are defined. These languages are called 'hybrid' because, as well as the familiar propositional variables and modal operators, they also contain variables across individuals and a binder that binds these variables. As is shown, combining aspects of modal and first-order logic in this manner allows the expressivity of concept languages to be boosted in a natural way, making it possible to define number restrictions, collections of individuals, irreflexivity of roles, and TBox- and ABox-statements. Subsequent addition of the universal modality allows the notion of subsumption to internalized, and enables the representation of queries to arbitrary first-order knowledge bases. The paper notes themes shared by the hybrid and concept language literatures, and draws attention to a little-known body of work by the late Arthur Prior.},

   Abstract = {This paper combines insights from Pustejovsky's GL theory with Van der Sandt's anaphora resolution algorithm. The phenomenon of bridging is accounted for in terms of linking anaphoric expressions to information that can be inferred from the lexical semantic knowledge that is stored in lexical entries. In doing so, we can distinguish between the normal linking cases as in (1), the special cases of coercive accommodation as in (2) and the bottom cases of accommodation as in (3).

   Abstract = {This paper reports on the TIGER Treebank, a corpus of currently 35.000 syntactically annotated German newspaper sentences. We describe what kind of information is encoded in the treebank and introduce the different representation formats that are used for the annotation and exploitation of the treebank. We explain the different methods used for the annotation: interactive annotation, using the tool (\em Annotate), and LFG parsing. Furthermore, we give an account of the annotation scheme used for the TIGER treebank. This scheme is an extended and improved version of the NEGRA annotation scheme and we illustrate in detail the linguistic extensions that were made concerning the annotation in the TIGER project. The main differences are concerned with coordination, verb-subcategorization, expletives as well as proper nouns. In addition, the paper also presents the query tool TIGERSearch that was developed in the project to exploit the treebank in an adequate way. We describe the query language which was designed to facilitate a simple formulation of complex queries; furthermore, we shortly introduce TIGERin, a graphical user interface for query input. The paper concludes with a summary and some directions for future work.},

Within this context, the annotation tool ANNOTATE, the export and XML formats of the TIGER Treebank and the TIGER search tool are briefly introduced. Secondly, the developments of the TIGER annotation scheme and their realization in the corpus are introduced focussing on the differences between the underlying NEGRA annotation scheme and the further developed TIGER annotation scheme. The main differences are concerned with verb-subcategorization, coordination, appositions and parentheses as well as proper nouns. Thirdly, the annotation scheme is assessed through an evaluation and a problem discussion of the above mentioned changes. For this purpose, inter- annotator agreement in the TIGER project has been analyzed focussing on exactly these changes. This analysis shows where the annotators' decision problems are. These difficulties are discussed in greater detail on the basis of annotation examples. The paper concludes with some suggestions for the improvement of the TIGER annotation scheme.},

   Abstract = {This thesis presents new techniques for parsing natural language. They are based on Markov Models, which are commonly used in part-of-speech tagging for sequential processing on the word level. We show that Markov Models can be successfully applied to other levels of syntactic processing. First, two classification tasks are handled: the assignment of grammatical functions and the labeling of non-terminal nodes. Then, Markov Models are used to recognize hierarchical syntactic structures. Each layer of a structure is represented by a separate Markov Model. The output of a lower layer is passed as input to a higher layer, hence the name: Cascaded Markov Models. Instead of simple symbols, the states emit partial context-free structures. The new techniques are applied to corpus annotation and partial parsing and are evaluated using corpora of different languages and domains.},

In particular, we investigate the performance of standard stochastic parsers when they are revised to operate incrementally, and with reduced memory resources. We present techniques for ranking and filtering analyses, together with experimental results. Our results confirm that stochastic parsers which adhere to these psychologically motivated constraints achieve good performance. Memory can be reduced down to 1% (compared to exhausitve search) without reducing recall and precision. Additionally, these models exhibit substantially faster performance. Finally, we argue that this general result is likely to hold for more sophisticated, and psycholinguistically plausible, probabilistic parsing models.},

   Abstract = {This paper will discuss the corpus annotation effort in the FLAG project and its application for assisting in the development of controlled language and grammar checking applications.
The main aim of theGerman government funded FLAGproject1 is to develop technologies for controlled language (CL) and grammar checking applications for German. The project work has therefore been divided into two separate but complementary streams of activity. Firstly, the aim was to develop an modular NLP software architecture for quickly developing different kinds of CL and grammar checking applications. Secondly, to validate the first activity, it was seen as important to build up an empirical base for testing and formally evaluating checking components. Given the lack of existing annotated corpora of errors for German (or indeed for any language as far as the authors know), the construction of such a corpus was a high priority task. This would enable us not only to perform quantitative tests, but also to derive an empirically based typology of errors which the project could use for orientation.
The corpus was particularly important given the approach which the FLAG project was taking to the task of grammar and controlled language checking, which relies on a phenomenonoriented approach to the problem of identifying errors, using shallow processing techniques. In order to finetune the heuristics which are central to such an approach, i.e. one based on identifying candidate errors of increasing probability, it is essential to have good test suites annotated with respect to the phenomena under investigation.
The annotation of the corpus was to be carried out in such a way that we could easily access and quantify snapshots of the data, for producing test suites for testing purposes and for producing statistics on the frequency of particular error types.
The research community not only lacked an annotated corpus of errors, there was no existing ontology of errors which could be easily translated into an annotation schema. The definition of such a schema based on traditional descriptions of errors (such as Luik, 1993a; Luik, 1993b) thus formed the first major workpackage. Fortunately, tools for the annotation of corpora, and the management thereof are becoming increasingly sophisticated; it was therefore necessary to evaluate a number of tools in the light of our specific needs.},

Readings of two German scripted dialogues were examined to ascertain characteristic features of the F0 contour for each utterance type. Final boundary tone, nuclear pitch accent, F0 offset, F0 onset, F0 range, and the slopes of a topline and a bottomline were determined for each utterance and compared for the four utterance types. Results show that for an average speaker, the final boundary tone, the F0 range, and the slope of the topline can be used to distinguish between the four utterance types. However, speakers may deviate from this pattern and exploit other intonational means to distinguish certain utterance types or choose not to mark a syntactic difference at all.},

In perception experiments using German speech synthesis, two standard duration models (Klatt rules and CART) were tested.  The input to these models consisted of symbolic strings which were either derived from a database or a text-to-speech system. Results of the perception experiments show that different duration models can only be distinguished when the symbolic string is appropriate.  Considering the relative importance of the symbolic representation, ``post-lexical'' segmental rules were investigated with the outcome that listeners differ in their preferences regarding the degree of segmental reduction.  As a conclusion, before fine-tuning the duration prediction, it is important to calculate an appropriate phonological symbolic representation in order to improve timing in synthetic speech.},

This leads to a new type of semantic lexicon (CoreLex ) that supports underspecified semantic tagging through a design based on systematic polysemous classes and a class-based acquisition of lexical knowledge for specific domains.},

In general, information extraction (IE) is a rather scaled down version of natural language understanding, in which there is little room for the processing of deep (i.e. lexical semantic) knowledge. However, in obvious ways, underspecified lexical semantic representations can be seen as shallow lexical meanings that have a similar status as chunks in syntactic processing. Therefore, the use of such representations in IE seems an attractive option to extend the semantic capabilities of these systems, although it is not entirely clear where underspecification will be useful and where not. It is the topic of this paper to investigate this into some respect.},

   Abstract = {This paper is concerned with a unified approach to the systematic polysemy and underspecification of nouns. Systematic polysemy -- senses that are systematically related and therefore predictable over classes of lexical items -- is fundamentally different from homonymy -- senses that are unrelated, non-systematic and therefore not predictable. At the same time, studies in discourse analysis show that lexical items are often left underspecified for a number of related senses. Clearly, there is a correspondence between these phenomena, the investigation of which is the topic of this paper. Acknowledging the systematic nature of polysemy and its relation to underspecified representations, allows one to structure ontologies for lexical semantic processing more efficiently, generating more appropriate interpretations within context. In order to achieve this, one needs a thorough analysis of systematic polysemy and underspecification on a large and useful scale. The paper establishes an ontology and semantic database (CoreLex) of 126 semantic types, covering around 40,000 nouns and defining a large number of systematic polysemous classes that are derived by a careful analysis of sense distributions in WordNet. The semantic types are underspecified representations based on generative lexicon theory.},

   Abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for finding systematic polysemous classes in WordNet and similar semantic databases, based on a definition in (Apresjan 1973). The introduction of systematic polysemous classes can reduce the amount of lexical semantic processing, because the number of disambiguation decisions can be restricted more clearly to those cases that involve real ambiguity (homonymy). In many applications, for instance in document categorization, information retrieval, and information extraction, it may be sufficient to know if a given word belongs to a certain class (underspecified sense) rather than to know which of its (related) senses exactly to pick. The approach for finding systematic polysemous classes is based on that of (Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), while addressing some previous shortcomings.},

   Abstract = {An important aspect of sense disambiguation is the wider semantic space (domain, topic) in which the ambiguous word occurs. This may be most clearly illustrated by some cross-lingual examples, as they would appear in (machine) translation. Consider for instance the English word housing. In a more general 'sense', this translates in German into "Wohnung". In an engineering setting however it translates into "Gehaeuse". Also verbs may be translated differently (i.e. have a different sense) according to the semantic space in which they occur. For instance, English "warming" up translates into "erhitzen" in a more general sense, but into "aufwaermen" in the sports domain. Because of the apparent relevance then of domains or topics on sense disambiguation, a panel was organized at SENSEVAL-2 to discuss some current and previous work in this area. The paper presents a more extended overview based on the relevant literature, besides giving a summary of the discussion that developed after the panel presentations.},

   Abstract = {SEMANTIC ANNOTATION is augmentation of data to facilitate automatic recognition of the underlying semantic structure. A common practice in this respect is labeling of documents with thesaurus classes for the sake of document classification and management. In the medical domain, for instance, there is a long-standing tradition in terminology maintenance and annotation/classification of documents using standard coding systems such as ICD, MeSH and the UMLS meta-thesaurus. Semantic annotation in a broader sense also addresses document structure (title, section, paragraph, etc.), linguistic structure (dependency, coordination, thematic role, co-reference, etc.), and so forth. In NLP, semantic annotation has been used in connection with machine-learning software trainable on annotated corpora for parsing, word-sense disambiguation, co-reference resolution, summarization, information extraction, and other tasks. A still unexplored but important potential of semantic annotation is that it can provide a common I/O format through which to integrate various component technologies in NLP and AI such as speech recognition, parsing, generation, inference, and so on.
INTELLIGENT CONTENT is semantically structured data that is used for a wide range of content-oriented applications such as classification, retrieval, extraction, translation, presentation, and question-answering, as the organization of such data provides machines with accurate semantic input to those technologies. Semantically annotated resources as described above are typical examples of intelligent content, whereas another major class includes electronic dictionaries and inter-lingual or knowledge-representation data. Some ongoing projects along these lines are GDA (Global Document Annotation), UNL (Universal Networking Language) and SHOE (Simple HTML Ontology Extension), all of which aim at motivating people to semantically organize electronic documents in machine-understandable formats, and at developing and spreading content-oriented application technologies aware of such formats. Along similar lines, MPEG-7 is a framework for semantically annotating audiovisual data for the sake of content-based retrieval and browsing, among others. Incorporation of linguistic annotation into MPEG-7 is in the agenda, because linguistic descriptions already constitute a main part of existing metadata. In short, semantic annotation is a central, basic technology for intelligent content, which in turn is a key notion in systematically coordinating various applications of semantic annotation. In the hope of fueling some of the developments mentioned above and thus promoting the linkage between basic researches and practical applications, the workshop invites researchers and practitioners from such fields as computational linguistics, document processing, terminology, information science, and multimedia content, among others, to discuss various aspects of semantic annotation and intelligent content in an interdisciplinary way.},

   Abstract = {A new approach to structure-driven generation is presented that is based on a separate semantics as input structure. For the first time, a GPSGbased formalism is complemented with a system of pattern-action rules that relate the parts of a semantics to appropriate syntactic rules. This way a front end generator can be adapted to some application system (such as a machine translation system) more easily than would be possible with many previous generators based on modern grammar formalisms.},

   Abstract = {Recently the problem of choosing communicatively adequate lexemes has attracted much interest in the NL generation community, in general, the task amounts to deciding for a given representation of an intended meaning, which words will most appropriately convey that meaning to the addressee.
Whether lexical choice must be exact in the sense that all and only the intended meaning is verbalized, depends on the respective communication situation. In a multimodal discourse, where language is supplemented by gestures or graphics, the linguistic device need not convey everything to the partner. In written discourse without a predefined context, as in DISCO, exact verbalization seems much more in order.
In all theories of lexical choice, the convergence problem has to be solved: there is always a decision for exactly one lexical item. We may distinguish the following subtasks of lexical choice:
Definite reference, proforms: Events and objects must often be described using words that allow for an unambiguous identification of the referent. The problem subdivides in finding appropriate words for the referents and in describing the relations between them, as deictic and intrinsic readings of "The ball is infront of the car" suggest.
Social jugdement: Some words carry social jugdements with them. German Putzfrau and Raumpflegerin mean both cleaning woman, but only the latter is now used officially.1 The former has a pejorative connotation. See [6].
Collocations: There are different kinds of cooccurrence restrictions between lexemes. Some words cannot be used together with others, some tend to be used together with others and some yield a different meaning when used with certain others (idioms).
Choice of open class words: Given a conceptual representation of the intended meaning, an appropriate word for each concept must be identified.
In this paper, we assume that for lexical selection the following kinds of knowledge are necessary:
 the concepts of the meaning representation language
 lexical entries (lemmata and/or phrasal items including semantic and syntactic in formation, among other things )
 knowledge about the reader (including the reader's goals ans beliefs)
 knowledge about the linguistic, situational, and social context
We will show that lexical choice requires a domain model based on linguistic considerations, and that standard KL-ONE techniques are insufficient for parts of the task at hand.},

   Abstract = {Constraint-based grammars can, in principle, serve as the major linguistic knowledge source for both parsing and generation. Surface generation starts from input semantics representations that may vary across grammars. For many declarative grammars, the concept of derivation implicitly built in is that of parsing. They may thus not be interpretable by a generation algorithm. We show that linguistically plausible semantic analyses can cause severe problems for semantic-head-driven approaches for generation (SHDG). We use SeReal, a variant of SHDG and the DISCO grammar of German as our source of examples. We propose a new, general approach that explicitly accounts for the interface between the grammar and the generation algorithm by adding a control-oriented layer to the linguistic knowledge base that reorganizes the semantics in a way suitable for generation.},

In contrast, cross-lingual generation is based on a language-neutral content representation which is the result of a linguistic analysis process. Non-linguistic representations do not reflect the structure of the text. Quite differently, language-neutral representations express functor-argument relationships and other semantic properties found by the underlying analysis process. These differences imply diverse generation tasks. In this contribution, we relate multi-lingual to cross-lingual generation and discuss emergent problems for the definition of an interlingua.},

   Abstract = {Die "Konferenz zur Verarbeitung natürlicher Sprache" (KONVENS) wird seit 1992 in zweijährigem Turnus von den wissenschaftlichen Fachgesellschaften DEGA, DGfS, GI, GLDV, ITG und ÖGAI ausgerichtet. Die KONVENS stellt einen wichtigen Kristallisationspunkt für die Veröffentlichung wissenschaftlicher Ergebnisse in der Sprachverarbeitung dar. 

Im Jahr 2002 wird die nunmehr sechste KONVENS von der GI, Fachgruppe "Natürlichsprachliche Systeme'', in Saarbrücken veranstaltet. Themen der wissenschaftlichen Konferenz sind alle Bereiche der maschinellen Verarbeitung von natürlicher Sprache in gesprochener als auch in geschriebener Form. Die Tagung verfolgt das Ziel, einen breiten Querschnitt durch die aktuelle Forschung und Entwicklung im Gebiet der Sprachverarbeitung zu bieten - unter Einschluss aller relevanten Disziplinen wie Computerlinguistik, Sprachtechnologie, Kognitions-Psychologie, Informatik, Akustik und Nachrichtentechnik. 

Beiträge aus der gesamten Bandbreite zwischen Forschung, Entwicklung, Anwendung und Evaluation von natürlichsprachlichen Ressourcen, Komponenten und Systemen waren in Form unveröffentlichter Forschungs- und Entwicklungsergebnisse oder innovativer industrieller Anwendungen willkommen. 44 Papiere wurden eingereicht und von je zwei Mitgliedern des Programmkomitees begutachtet, die teilweise weitere Gutachter hinzuzogen. In diesem Begutachtungsverfahren wählte das Programmkomitee 22 Beiträge als Vorträge und 11 als Poster zur Präsentation während der Tagung und zur Veröffentlichung aus. 

Zudem konnten zwei hochrangige Wissenschaftler gewonnen werden, ihre aktuellen Arbeiten in Form eingeladener Vorträge vorzustellen. Christiane Fellbaum (Princeton University und Berlin-Brandenburgische Akadamie der Wissenschaften) beschreibt Arbeiten zur Repräsentation idiomatischer Wendungen im Lexikon und lexikalischen Datenbanken (WordNet). Matthew Crocker (Universität des Saarlandes) zieht Verbindungen zwischen Psycholinguistik und statistischer Computerlinguistik. 
Der vorliegende Tagungsband enthält Kurzfassungen der eingeladenen Vorträge sowie die angenommenen Vorträge und Poster. 

Im Namen des Programmkomitees danke ich herzlich allen Autorinnen und Autoren, die durch ihre Einreichung ein interessantes und anspruchsvolles Tagungsprogramm ermöglichten. Besonders möchte ich den beiden eingeladenen Vortragenden, Christiane Fellbaum und Matthew Crocker, für ihre Beiträge danken. Dem Gastgeber der Konferenz, der DFKI GmbH, gebührt Dank für die Bereitstellung der Räumlichkeiten, der Infrastruktur sowie von Arbeitskraft. Bei der Erstellung der Webseite http://konvens2002.dfki.de und des vorliegenden Tagungsbandes haben Carmen Görl und Matthias Rinck wesentlich mitgewirkt. Das Konferenz-Sekretariat wurde von Corinna Johanns geleitet, die nicht nur die finanzielle Seite der Konferenz betreute, sondern sich auch um die lukullischen und touristischen Aspekte kümmerte: der halbtägige Ausflug nach Nennig und zur Villa Borg mit abendlichem Bankett führt uns in beiderlei Hinsicht auf römische Spuren im Saarland. 

Allen Mitwirkenden danke ich sehr herzlich für ihr besonderes Engangement, ohne das diese Tagung nicht möglich gewesen wäre. 

Ausdrücklich möchte ich allen Mitgliedern des Programmkomitees für die effiziente und reibungslose Zusammenarbeit beim Zustandekommen des Tagungsprogramms danken.},

   Abstract = {In order to support the efficient development of NL generation systems, two orthogonal methods are currently pursued with emphasis: (1) reusable, general, and linguistically motivated surface realization components, and (2) simple, task-oriented template-based techniques. In this paper we argue that, from an application-oriented perspective, the benefits of both are still limited. In order to improve this situation, we suggest and evaluate shallow generation methods associated with increased flexibility. We advise a close connection between domain-motivated and linguistic ontologies that supports the quick adaptation to new tasks and domains, rather than the reuse of general resources. Our method is especially designed for generating reports with limited linguistic variations.},

   Abstract = {In the field of multimodal presentation of information on a computer screen normally the modes Text and (statical) Graphics are used [Feiner'89, Wahlster'90 + '93]. But especially the computer screen yields the possibility to present informations in the form of animated graphics, i.e. animations. [Badler'90, Karp'90]. One advantage of animations is, that the dimension Time (succession, duration) can immediately be expressed. Another advantage is, that in an animation it is much easier to (virtually) cross the border to the third spatial dimension than it is in statical graphics. The problem of synthesizing an animation was regarded in this work as a planning problem and the result is an animation planner that, starting from an visualization goal, plans the whole script for an animation including all low-level camera and object motions. The system takes all decisions about camera positions, zooms, moves and cuts considering the actual context as well as some fundamental filmmaking rules [Karp'90]. The script is then realized by a given animation system which computes the single frames and does the playback. BETTY is part of the multimodal user interface WIP (Knowledge-based Presentation of Information, [Wahlster'93]), that generates instructions for technical devices. At the moment BETTY is able to compute animations to demonstrate movements, to localize parts of a device and to explode constructive groups.},

   Abstract = {This paper presents the structure and activitities of the recently established Competence Center in Speech and Language Technology in Saarbrücken. The objectives of the Competence Center are to provide a comprehensive information service about speech and language technologies, including live demonstrations of the most important language technology (LT) systems, and to advance the state of the art in the evaluation of LT systems for realworld applications. The Competence Center comprises the following components: 
1. the Virtual Information Center "Language Technology World" (www.ltworld.org), the world's most comprehensive information resource about speech and language technology, 
2. the Demonstration Center in Saarbrücken, which offers interested parties the possibility to play and experiment with different speech and language technologies, or to attend guided demonstrations, 3. the Evaluation Center, which conducts evaluations of the overall usability of language technology systems and advances knowledge of relevant usability issues and evaluation methods. The work presented in this paper was carried out by the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in collaboration with Saarland University in the context of the project COLLATE (COmputational Linguistics and LAnguage TEchnology for Real Life Applications), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (www.bmbf.de).},

   Abstract = {FEELTRACE is an instrument developed to let observers track the emotional content of a stimulus as they perceive it over time, allowing the emotional dynamics of speech episodes to be examined. It is based on activation-evaluation space, a representation derived from psychology. The activation dimension measures how dynamic the emotional state is; the evaluation dimension is a global measure of the positive or negative feeling associated with the state. Research suggests that the space is naturally circular, i.e. states which are at the limit of emotional intensity define a circle, with alert neutrality at the centre.
To turn those ideas into a recording tool, the space was represented by a circle on a computer screen, and observers described perceived emotional state by moving a pointer (in the form of a disc) to the appropriate point in the circle, using a mouse. Prototypes were tested, and in the light of results, refinements were made to ensure that outputs were as consistent and meaningful as possible. They include colour coding the pointer in a way that users readily associate with the relevant emotional state; presenting key emotion words as landmarks at the strategic points in the space; and developing an induction procedure to introduce observers to the system.
An experiment assessed the reliability of the developed system. Stimuli were 16 clips from TV programs, two showing relatively strong emotions in each quadrant of activationevaluation space, each paired with one of the same person in a relatively neural state. 24 raters took part.
Differences between clips chosen to contrast were statistically robust. Results were plotted in activation-evaluation space as ellipses, each with its centre at the mean co-ordinates for the clip, and its width proportional to standard deviation across raters. The size of the ellipses meant that about 25 could be fitted into the space, i.e. FEELTRACE has resolving power comparable to an emotion vocabulary of 20 non-overlapping words, with the advantage of allowing intermediate ratings, and above all, the ability to track impressions continuously.},

   Address= {Edinburgh, Scotland},
   Abstract = {Models of human language processing increasingly advocate probabilistic mechanisms for parsing and disambiguation (e.g. Jurafsky, 1996; MacDonald et al 1994; Crocker and Corley; to appear). These models resolve local syntactic and lexical ambiguity by promoting the analysis which has the greatest probability of being correct. In this talk we will outline a new probabilistic parsing model which is a generalisation of the Hidden Markov Models which have previously been defended as pschological models of lexical category disambiguation (Corley and Crocker, in press). The model uses layered, or cascaded, markov models (CMMs) to build up a syntactic analysis (Brants, 1999).

In contrast with many probabilisic parsing models, CMMs can easily be implemented to parse incrementally. Incremental CMMs have the property of generating partial structures including hypothetical continuations after receiving each new word in the input. New material is incorporated into the existing structure and ambiguities are resolved based on local context. Alternative hypotheses are assigned probabilities which are used for ranking, and only a bounded number of parallel alternatives are pursued. Simple bounds on the model straightforwardly predict the recency effects often attributed only to connectionist-based models (Stevenson, 1994; Macdonald et al, 1884; Kempen and Vosse, 1987).

In contrast with several current models, the combination of weights in CMMs is motivated directly by probability theory. The parameters of the model are acquired automatically from a corpus, and there are relatively few stipulations about how probabilities are combined (contra Jurafsky, 1996; Tanenhaus et al, in press). An important cognitive parameter concerns the number of analyses which are maintained in parallel. We will present results of experiments which evaluate the performance of the model for both general language processing, and on several critical ambiguities where human performance is well understood.

The model is a first step in exploring the role of optimal models of human linguistic performance, as motivated by Chater, Crocker, and Pickering (1998). Recently, Pickering, Traxler and Crocker (to appear) have provided experimental evidence which challenges a pure maximum likelihood model of syntactic ambiguity resolution. As an alternative, they propose a measure, termed Informativity, which they derive from a rational analysis of the parsing and interpretation problem. In the final part of the talk we will outline how the presented model can be adapted to implement Informativity, which combines probability with a newly proposed measure termed Specificity.},

In this paper, I shall discuss an apparent paradox in the morphology and syntax of Fox (Mesquakie) complex verbs. In Fox, verbs can be modified by one or more of a variety of preverbs including modals, aspectuals, manner adverbials, numerals, quantifiers, as well as preverbs which increase the valence of the main verb (Dahlstrom, 1997a). While preverb and verb can be separated by words, phrases, or even embedded sentences, suggesting a status as syntactically independent words, in ection (cf. Dahlstrom, 1997a) and derivation (cf. Ackerman and LeSourd, 1994) appear to treat preverb-verb complexes as a single morphological unit.

Following the basic assumptions of lexicalist syntax, I claim that Fox preverb-verb combinations are indeed morphologically derived and that inflectional affixes are attached to complex morphological objects in the word-formation component already. In order to account for the syntactic effects, I propose an analysis in Linearisation HPSG (Reape, 1994, Kathol, 1995), which builds on the assumption that Fox preverb-verb complexes introduce more than one domain object into syntax (cf. Kathol, 1996 for German, Crysmann, 1997 for European Portuguese). Further morphological material will then be distributed across preverb and verb by imposing partial morphological (order) constraints on PHON-values.},

More specifically, I will argue that the class of proclisis licensors is best described in semantic terms (i.e. in terms of logical entailment), whereas the relation between proclisis licensor and licensee should be conceived of as entirely surface-syntactic. It will be shown that approches which mediate the licensing relation by means of syntactic movement (Barbosa, 1996; Duarte, 1983; Madeira, 1992, cf. e.g.) are faced with both motivational and empirical problems. Instead, I claim that surface-syntactic linearisation constraints will relate clitic placement directly to a class of lexical items, which in turn is defined on the basis of semantic properties. Therefore, an integrated model of syntax and semantics is called for which builds on highly articulate lexical information. The analysis will, thus, be carried out in the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1987; 1994), using multiple inheritance type hierarchies and linearisation constraints.

The paper is organised as follows: in the first section, I shall briefly describe the basic empirical observations regarding EP proclisis. In section two, I shall review the empirical problems faced by previous (mostly syntactic) approaches. Section three provides the details of the proposal, starting with a semantic typology of proclisis licensors. In the remainder of the section, I outline the surface-syntactic constraints which define the phenogrammatical relation between licensor and licensee, analysing EP proclisis in an essentially similar way to English negative polarity items (NPI) (cf. Ladusaw, 1996, and reference cited there).},

Motivated by the rigorous application of the diagnostic criteria suggested in Zwicky and Pullum (1983) and Miller (1992), clitics in Romance languages are treated as lexical afixes, whose morphological and morphosyntactic properties are derived entirely within the lexicon (Miller and Sag 1997; Monachesi (1996). Weak pronominals in Polish (Kupsc 1999) and second position clitics in Serbo-Croat (Penn 1999), however, enjoy a much higher degree of syntactic transparency, favouring an analysis in terms of linearisation approaches. In this paper, I will suggest that European Portuguese (EP) represents a transitional type, where clitics have already acquired the morphological properties of lexical affixes, yet, ``the rules governing clitic placement seem to relate more to syntax than to prosody or morphology'' (Spencer 1991, p. 365). I will argue that the distinction between constituent structure and order domains, as drawn in linearisation-based variants of HPSG, provides the necessary tools to model the syntax of transparent affixes, relating EP clitics to both their Romance and Slavic counterparts.},

   Abstract = {In the context of lexicalist studies of Romance cliticisation, the development and rigorous application of diagnostic criteria (Zwicky and Pullum, 1983; Miller, 1992) as to their lexical or syntactic status has always enjoyed a central role. As a result, there is a vast body of evidence in French and Italian (Miller 1992; Miller and Sag, 1997; Monachesi, 1996) that weak pronominals in these languages resemble ordinary bound affixes much more than true postlexical clitics. In particular, syntactic, semantic, morphological, and phonological criteria jointly militate against the view of Romance clitics as proper inhabitants of the syntactic world. As a side effect, the distinction between lexical affixes and postlexical clitics (Halpern, 1995) is seen as a strict dichotomy, with little or no room for true morpho-syntactic hybrids.

I will argue in this paper that transitional types do indeed occur, which are characterised by the fact that one group of criteria (e.g. morphological criteria) positively suggest syntactic opacity, while almost all syntactic criteria demand a degree of transparency. Based on data from clitic placement and coordination, however, I will suggest that the syntactic transparency is highly superficial in nature, and thus favours an account in terms of word order variation. This perspective will also prove to make appropriate predictions in the context of semantic idiosyncrasies.},

The traditional assumption is that German in this respect behaves parallel to English in the sense that extraction from subjects is be ungrammatical, while extraction out of objects is grammatical. In this paper we show that one can account for all those cases where extraction from subjects is ungrammatical without having to postulate subject-object asymmetries for German. Instead, we argue that mainly lexical properties of the governing head determine the possibility of extraction from its arguments. Finally, we show how lexical constraints in HPSG can capture the observed generalizations.},

It is then shown that there is clear empirical evidence for a UDC approach.

   Abstract = {Linear precedence in so-called free word order languages remains challenging for modern grammar formalisms. To address this issue, we describe a new framework for dependency grammar, with a modular decomposition of immediate dependency and linear precedence. Our approach distinguishes two orthogonal yet mutually constraining structures: a syntactic dependency tree (ID tree) and a topological dependency tree (LP tree). The ID tree is non-projective, and even non-ordered, and its edges are labeled by syntactic roles. The LP tree is projective, partially ordered, and its edges are labeled by topological fields. The shape of the LP tree is a flattening of the ID tree's obtained by allowing nodes to 'climb up'. Our theory of ID/LP trees is formulated in terms of (a) lexicalized constraints and (b) principles governing e.g. climbing conditions. We illustrate it with a detailed account of word order phenomena in the verbal complex of German verb final sentences.},

In GB, movement is carried out by tree transformations. In DD, it is the effect of well-formedness conditions on dependency trees and does not involve transformations. We illustrate both kinds of movement by showing how both theories analyze German verb-second clauses. Then, we point out the similarities between GB and DD, and raise the question whether GB's transformational notion of movement could be replaced by DD's constraint-based account of movement.},

   Abstract = {Beginning with the groundbreaking work of Chomsky in the 1950s, syntactians have concentrated mostly on the English language. But English is not a typical natural language: in particular, its word order is very rigid, as opposed to most other languages which exhibit freer word order. The phrase structure-based approach employed for the analysis of English runs into severe problems when confronted with freer word order languages. Aside from the mainstream, linguists in Eastern Europe and Japan have pursued an approach to syntax which seemed better suited for the analysis of freer word order languages: dependency grammar. The key asset of dependency grammar is that it allows for a clean separation of syntactic dependency and surface word order. Unfortunately, none of the frameworks for dependency grammar has really caught on. We suggest two reasons for their failure: 1. many of the dependency-based frameworks lack proper formalization and, perhaps surprisingly, 2. most of them lack a realistic and workable account of word order. In this thesis, we try to remedy these problems in the setting of a constraint-based approach to dependency grammar based on (Duchier 1999). We present a new account of word order for dependency grammar couched in a declarative grammatical formalism called Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG). TDG allows to cleanly separate the two levels of syntactic dependency and surface word order, which greatly facilitates the conception of grammars for freer word order languages. In addition, we can efficiently parse with TDG grammars: using a reduction described in (Duchier 2000), we achieved an efficient parser implementation using modern constraint programming techniques.},

But in order to deal with such texts, it is also necessary to process linguistic units which are larger than sentences. The resolution of crosssentential anaphora is one of the problems we have to deal with, when we switch towards the analysis of such larger linguistic units. In order to propose an analysis of the crosssentential anaphora, one has to be able to refer back to an antecedent, which is to be found in a preceding sentence. This will be done on the basis of an informationpassing framework. Using also the simple unification technique a resolution of the pronoun can then be tried out: parts of the content information of the pronoun are going to be compared (unified) with specific parts of the content information of the (possible) antecedent.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes various uses of the Text Handling to Linguistic Structure (TH-LS) component of the Advanced Linguistic Engineering Platform (ALEP). Basically, the Text Handling (TH) subsystem of ALEP performs a conversion of the input string to a SGML text. The TH-LS component consists in a set of so-called 'tsls' rules defining a mapping between textual structures (TS) and (partial) linguistic descriptions (PLS). The instantiated PLS are the input for the linguistic parser, dealing with linguistic structures (LS). I show how an adequate use of the TH-LS interface permits the modularization of the lingware and the definition of subgrammars, from morpheme level to the whole text, taking into consideration both processing steps and levels of grammar descritpion. The TH subsystem of ALEP also foresees the +tag for user-supplied markup. An intensive use of this possibility and also the integration of information delivered by a PoS tagger into the TH component allowed both a substantial extension of the coverage and a significant improvement of the efficiency of the ALEP-based grammars, the parser getting as an input linguistically enriched PLS.},

For this we extended an approach described within the LS-GRAM project, which consisted in defining the Text Handling component of ALEP in such a way that so-called "messy details" are handled within this subsystem, hence keeping the (linguistic) parser free from such tasks. We just extended the tagging strategy used for this purpose to normal words and modified the default tagging of words proposed by the ALEP system in order to incorporate information delivered by the part-of-speech tagger. The resulting tagging is converted by means of "lift" rules into partial linguistic descriptions, which provide the direct input to the grammatical analysis. We show that this procedure substantially reduces the parse times of the system.},

Applicationoriented grammar development has to take into account the following parameters: 
Efficiency: The project chose a so called 'lean' formalism, a termencodable language providing efficient term unification, ALEP. 
Coverage: The project adopted a corpusbased approach. 
Completeness: All modules needed from text handling to semantics must be there. 
The paper reports on a text handling component, Two Level morphology, word structure, phrase structure, semantics and the interfaces between these components. Mainstream approach: The approach claims to be mainstream, very much indebted to HPSG, thus based on the currently most prominent and recent linguistic theory. The relation (and tension) between these parameters are described in this paper.},

Because the well known \textit{append} program matches this pattern, we will denote such programs "\textit{append}-like''. In spite of their simple appearance, we prove in this paper that termination and satisfiability (i.e the existence of answer-substitutions, called the \textit{emptiness problem}) for are undecidable. We also study some subcases depending on the number of occurrences of variables in \textit{fact}, \textit{goal}, \textit{left} or \textit{right}. Moreover, we prove that the computational power of \textit{append}-like programs is equivalent to the one of Turing machines ; we show that there exists an \textit{append}-like universal program. Thus, we propose an equivalent of the Böhm-Jacopini theorem for logic programming. This result confirms the expressiveness of logic programming. The proofs are based on program transformations and encoding of problems, unpredictable iterations within number theory defined by J.H. Conway or the Post correspondence problem.},

   Abstract = {Research on the expression of emotion is underpinned by databases. Reviewing available resources persuaded us of the need to develop one that prioritised ecological validity. The basic unit of the database is a clip, which is an audiovisual recording of an episode that appears to be reasonably selfcontained. Clips range from 10 -- 60 secs, and are captured as MPEG files. They were drawn from two main sources. People were recorded discussing emotive subjects either with each other, or with one of the research team. We also recorded extracts from television programs where members of the public interact in a way that at least appears essentially spontaneous. Associated with each clip are two additional types of file. An audio file (.wav format) contains speech alone, edited to remove sounds other than the main speaker. An interpretation file describes the emotional state that observers attribute to the main speaker, using the FEELTRACE system to provide a continuous record of the perceived ebb and flow of emotion. Clips have been extracted for 100 speakers, with at least two for each speaker (one relatively neutral and others showing marked emotions of different kinds).},

   Abstract = {Tree descriptions are widely used in computational linguistics for talking and reasoning about trees. For practical applications, it is essential to be able to decide satisfiability and enumerate solutions efficiently. This challenge cannot realistically be met by brute force enumeration. However it can be addressed very effectively by constraint propagation as provided by modern constraint technology. Previously, we studied the conjunctive fragment of tree descriptions and showed how the problem of finding minimal models of a conjunctive tree description could be transformed into a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on finite set variables. In this paper, we extend our account to the fragment that admits both negation and disjunction, but still leaves out quantification. Again we provide a reduction to a CSP. While our previous encoding introduced the reader to set constraints and disjunctive propagators, we now extend our arsenal with selection propagators.},

   Abstract = {This course demonstrates how constraint programming can be used effectively in practice, for linguistic applications. It shows how many forms of ambiguity arising in linguistic can be represented compactly and elegantly, and processed efficiently with constraints. A key idea to derive the most benefit from constraint propagation is that intended models should be characterized as solutions of \emph{Constraint Satisfaction Problems} (CSPs) rather than defined inductively or in a generative fashion. We examine several topics in detail: encodings of finite domains, tree descriptions using dominance constraints, and parsing with dependency grammars. In each case, we present a formal characterization of the problem as a CSP and illustrate how to derive a corresponding constraint program. The course includes 4 complete interactive applications written in Oz, with full code supplied. Through these programmatic vignettes the reader is exposed to the practice of constraint programming with \emph{finite domain} and \emph{finite set} variables, and introduced to some of the more powerful types of constraints available today, such as reified constraints, disjunctive propagators, and selection constraints.},

Our module discipline is based on functors, which are annotated functions that are applied to modules and return modules. Pickled computed functors can be used interchangeably with compiled functors. In contrast to compiled functors, pickled computed functors can carry computed data structures with them, which has significant practical applications.},

The book is structured in the way people learn: Examples and immediate practice in the spoken and written medium illustrate and consolidate newly acquired linguistic knowledge, improving and strengthening listening and pronunciation skills, and raising language awareness. Since hard work without motivating support is difficult to sustain, the relative importance and usefulness of the different phonetic phenomena are explained, and pictures, cartoons, jokes, old and new limericks and dialogues are used to raise and maintain students' interest and help them to remember important distinctions in a complex subject matter which is not always immediately accessible to the uninitiated. As the table of contents reveals, the book has a highly modularized structure, which is suited to selective remedial practice, and helps in the revision of particular problem areas. There is a great variety of exercises  ear-training, discrimination exercises, problem solving, phonetic transcription, etc.  for beginners and advanced students. Solutions are provided at the end of the book, and there is an index for quick reference to technical terms. The file structure of the CD-ROM facilitates quick access to any exercise in any order.},

   Abstract = {Frequently an utterance can only be understood if one integrates additional material into its meaning, which mediates between semantically conflicting parts of the utterance. This process is known as reinterpretation. From a synchronic viewpoint, it is a 'creative' or 'dynamic' aspect of natural language, to be described and integrated in a formal description of natural language semantics. But reinterpretation phenomena can also be regarded as a gateway for linguistic change, since they may get conventionalized and thus enlarge the domain of compositional semantics. Analyzing reinterpretation will therefore also provide insights into mechanisms of linguistic change. The proposed account of reinterpretation goes as follows. Semantic construction yields ambiguous structures for reinterpretation cases, which are then monotonically enriched with information from extralinguistic sources (e.g. world knowledge). Semantic ambiguities are described in the framework of underspecification. This account of reinterpretation allows a straightforward modelling of its synchronic and diachronic aspects.},

   Abstract = {We present an approach to VP ellipsis that allows the direct derivation of source and target sentences (the former need not be unique) during semantic construction.  Specific syntactic constituent structures are associated with ellipsis potential, which can then be discharged by pro-verbs like 'did (too)'. The determination of source and target sentence, which is done with semantic features in an HPSG framework, is coupled with a comprehensive analysis of ellipsis, which also handles its interaction with scope and anaphora.},

CLLS features constraints for dominance, lambda binding, parallelism, and anaphoric links. In the case of antecedent contained deletion (ACD), the definition of parallelism in the original version of CLLS is slightly too restrictive due to an overly weak notion of quantifier identity. We show how to extend CLLS with an appropriate notion of quantifier identity such that ACD can be naturally analysed. This sheds some light on conflicting requirements on quantifier representations as needed for ACD and Hirschbühler sentences.},

The sentence with the unknown word is parsed. There are no special requirements for the parsing algorithm, but the lexical lookup procedure needs to be modified. 
Based on the syntactic structure of the parse, information about the unknown word can be extracted. 
The information obtained in step 2 may be too fully specified for a lexical entry. Therefore a filter is applied to it to create a new lexical entry. 
An application of the method is illustrated with examples from Categorial Unification Grammar. The problem of using the extracted information for lexical knowledge acquisition is discussed.},

   Abstract = {We describe the parser of LEU/2, the Linguistic Experimentation Environment of the LILOG project. The parser is designed to support and encourage experimentation with different grammars, different styles of writing grammar, and with different parsing strategies. 

Unlike the parser of the first LILOG prototype, which was designed specifically for Categorial Unification Grammars, the present parser places hardly any restrictions on the format of the grammar, and also supports rules in ID/LP-format under two interpretations of LP statements. Empty categories can be processed. The parser includes a mechanism for processing unknown words, and for determining sentence boundaries in continuous text. The parser is a bottom-up chart parser for grammars encoded in STUF. Although the emphasis of the parser is on experimentation with different grammars rather than efficient analysis of texts, we have tried to make the parser as efficient as possible to make it a powerful experimentation tool for the grammar designer. In order to implement parsing strategies, the parsing process is decomposed into individual parsing tasks, which are placed onto an agenda according to their priority. 

This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we discuss various choices in parser design, and motivate our design decisions by the use of the parser in a linguistic development environment. In the second part, the parser is described in more detail. Some familiarity with chart parsing is assumed.},

   Abstract = {Attempting to treat ambiguities in typed feature formalisms presents a dilemma. The exploitation of linguistic knowledge for adding additional constraints (e.g. word order, selectional restrictions) to the grammar may indeed help disambiguation, but it also rules out some perfectly grammatical non-ambiguous strings. Ways out of this dilemma are discussed in this paper. They include 
- reliance on processin g strategies without addition of additional knowledge 
- processing guided by statistical probability 
- leaving desambiguation to external knowledge sources 
- using additional constraints only if they are needed for disambiguation. 
We propose the addition of preference values to typed ferature structures. Using preference values has the effect that violation of the additional constraints needed for disambiguation only decreases the preference value, but does not make the sentence unacceptable. Disambiguation is achieved by selecting the reading with the highest preference value. We think that it is possible to define a processing strategy (preference-driven linguistic deduction) that finds the preferred reading first.},

   Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the lexical representation of idioms. We distinguish idioms from other kinds of multiple-word expressions like collocations, support-verb constructions, and lexicalized metaphors. A lexical representation for idioms in Head-driven Phrease Structure Grammar (HPSG) is proposed, which can account for the syntactic variability found in idiomatic constructions, and for the non-compositional semantics of idioms. Since all idioms, which are not completely fixed, consist of a lexical head and "frozen" complements, the information about an idiomatic expression can be encoded in the subcategorization list of the idiom's lexical head. Since idioms in volve selection for particular lexemes, a feature is added to HPSG signs to encode this lexemic information. It will be argued that the Locality Principle of HPSG is too strong because it prohibits the representation of idioms proposed in this paper, and that the Semantics Principle must be modified. We explain the fact that some idioms do not passivize by the fact that no thematic role is assigned to accusative objects like "the bucket" in "kick the bucket".},

We discuss the adequacy of different grammatical formalisms for dealing with grammar errors, and show that context-free grammars are not expressive enough, but that constraint-based grammars are more suitable, if absolute and non-absolute constraints are distinguished.

ProFIT programs are compiled into Prolog programs, so that no meta-interpreter is needed for their execution. ProFIT thus provides a direct step from grammars developed with typed feature terms to Prolog programs usable for applications.},

   Abstract = {We propose a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction. Bottom-up deduction is preferable to top-down deduction because it allows incremental processing (even for head-driven grammars), it is data-driven, no subsumption check is needed, and preference values attached to lexical items can be used to guide best-first search. We discuss the scanning step for bottom-up Earley deduction and indexing schemes that help avoid useless deduction steps.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, we present an alternative approach to multiple inheritance for typed feature structures. In our approach, a feature structure can be associated with several types coming from different hierarchies (dimensions). In case of multiple inheritance, a type has supertypes from different hierarchies. We contrast this approach with approaches based on a single type hierarchy where a feature structure has only one unique most general type, and multiple inheritance involves computation of greatest lower bounds in the hierarchy. The proposed approach supports current linguistic analyses in constraint-based formalisms like HPSG, inheritance in the lexicon, and knowledge representation for NLP systems. Finally, we show that multi-dimensional inheritance hierarchies can be compiled into a Prolog term representation, which allows to compute the conjunction of two types efficiently by Prolog term unification.},

ProFIT allows the programmer or grammar developer to declare an inheritance hierarchy, features and templates. Typed feature terms can be used in ProFIT programs together with Prolog terms to provide a clearer description language for linguistic structures. ProFIT compiles all typed feature terms into a Prolog term representation, so that the built-in Prolog term unification can be used for the unification of typed feature structures, and no special unification algorithm is needed. ProFIT programs are compiled into Prolog programs, so that no meta-interpreter is needed for their execution. ProFIT thus provides a direct step from grammars developed with typed feature terms to Prolog programs usable for applications.},

   Abstract = {The thesis discusses the processing of principle-based grammars such as HPSG, with an application to best-first processing for disambiguation, selection of paraphrases and possibly also handling ill-formed input. Grammars are treated as a definite clause programs, to which program transformation and deduction techniques can be applied. In particular, the view of constraint logic programming is adopted, which abstracts away from the handling of constraints (which is regarded as a service provided by the constraint solver) and concentrates on resolution strategies. The contributions of the thesis are the following: 

A constraint language supporting sorted feature terms, Prolog terms, multi-dimensional inheritance, finite domains, by compilation to Prolog terms. The constraint language has been extended with external constraint solvers for set constraints, LP constraints, guarded constraints. 
A partial deduction system for compiling a principle-based grammar into a set of grammar rules. Partial deduction can be applied selectively through control information in the program, which makes it possible to do experimental work in order to determine the selection of goals to which partial deduction is best applied in order to bring the greatest performance improvement. 
Bottom-Up Earley deduction as a deduction system which generalises bottom-up chart parsing to a wider class of grammars/programs than just those with a context-free backbone. Bottom-up Earley deduction is better suited for handling discontinuous constituency than its top-down counterpart, it allows best-first search based on bottom-up information (e.g. tag probabilities), and provides different indexing schemes for different modes of combination of items. The correctness, completeness and termination properties of the algorithm have been shown. 
A generalised linguistic deduction system, which allows combination of different deduction strategies via control annotations, and which is tightly integrated with the underlying programming language in order to achieve efficiency. 
A fully incremental algorithm for bottom-up Earley deduction has been specified, which can cope efficiently with a change in the query by re-using intermediate deduction results as much as possible. 
Augmentation of a definite clause language with preference values. We have discussed how preference values from a variety of sources can be combined.},

   Abstract = {The paper presents a description and analysis of two kinds of collocational phenomena of German: idioms and support verb constructions (Funktionsverbgefüge). Collocational phenomena in general are characterized by restricted lexical selection of the collocation partners. 

First a characterization of idioms and support verb constructions is given, and idioms and support verb constructions are differentiated from "compositional collocations''. "Compositional collocations" differ from idioms and support verb constructions as the meaning of a "compositional collocation" is derived by the usual compositional semantic functions from the meanings of its constituents, and their syntactic properties are similar to non collocational constructions. 

Further syntactic and semantic properties of idioms and support verb constructions are described. Unanalyzable and metaphorical idioms are distinguished. While unanalyzable idioms are diachronical often derived from metaphors, a metaphorical interpretation is no longer possible, and their meaning must be listed in the lexicon. In case of metaphorical idioms, where each part must be assigned a (metaphorical) meaning, the meaning of the parts either must be assigned in the lexicon or metaphorization rules must be stated in the grammar. 

Support verb constructions, which consist of a verb (the support verb) and a noun phrase including the nominal collocation partner (the predicative noun) of the verb, function as predicates and differ from idioms in the ability to express different phases of a process via Aktionsart, and the ability to express causative as well as non causative variation. 

Both idioms and support verb constructions allow for different degrees of syntactic variation and internal modification. There are some idioms and support verb constructions which are completely fixed. The majority, however, allows for considerably more flexibility such as passivisation, or flexibility in word order, heads and complements need not be adjacent. Due to this simmilarity, we have made an attempt to treat idioms and support verb constructions in a simmilar way. 

HPSG, as it stands, is not well equipped to handle lexical selection. We have argued that in case of totally fixed idioms a representation of multi-word lexemes with the specification of the PHON feature is appropriate. For idioms which consist of a head and a "frozen" complement and support verb constructions we proposed to handle the relationship between the head and the "frozen" complement or predicative noun, respectively, by subcategorization. Depending on how fixed the "frozen" complement or predicative noun is, either the PHON feature, the DAUGHTERS feature or the newly introduced INDEX feature LEXEME is specified. As a consequence, we subcategorize for feature structures of type SIGN instead of SYNSEM. 

We have specified the semantics of idioms in the syntactic head of the construction. The semantics of the "frozen" complement is ignored, and the Quantifier Inheritance Principle is modified so that quantification over the "frozen" complement is avoided. 

The semantic core of the support verb construction is inherited from the predicative noun; in general the support verb adds the Aktionsart and possibly information about the causative relation. The support verb fills one of its argument positions with the predicative noun, and its other argument positions with arguments of the predicative noun. Any remaining arguments of the predicative noun are appended to the SUBCAT list of the support verb. In case of causative support verb constructions, one argument position of the support verb is filled by the cause(r).},

Simulations in concrete biochemical computing settings have been given by [Ogihara/Ray 96] and [Amos/Dunne97]. In this paper, we show how to simulate Boolean circuits by finite splicing systems, an abstract model of enzymatic recombination. We argue that using an abstract model of DNA computation as a basis leads to simulations of greater clarity and generality. In our construction, the running time of the simulating system is proportional to the depth, and the use of material is proportional to the size of the Boolean circuit simulated. However, the rules of the simulating splicing system depend on the size of the Boolean circuit, but not on the connectives used.},

The traditional approach to parsing with such grammars is based on generate & test and cannot avoid this high worst-case complexity. This paper proposes an alternative approach, based on constraint programming: Given a grammar, constraints formulated on an abstract interpretation of the grammar's logical structure are used to prune the search space during parsing. The approach is provably sound and complete, and reduces the search space in steps that are mostly linear or low-polynomial.},

   Title = {Robust Processing for Constraint-based Grammar Formalisms},
   School = {Department of Language and Linguistics, University of Essex},
   Month = {April},
   Abstract = {This thesis addresses the issue of how Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems using "constraint-based" grammar formalisms can be made robust, i.e. able to deal with input which is in some way ill-formed or extragrammatical. In NLP systems which use constraint-based grammars the operation of unification typically plays a central role. Accordingly, the central concern of this thesis is to propose an approach to robust unification.

The first part of the thesis underlines the importance of robustness in NLP, provides an overview of the sort of phenomena that require it, and reviews the state of the art. From this, it appears that no methods currently exist for robust processing with grammars of any real linguistic sophistication.

The class of constraint-based grammars studied here is that based on Typed Feature Logic (TFL), of which Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar is the instance chosen for exemplification. The formalism is described in the second part of the thesis.

Grammars based on TFL involve the notion of a signature, which defines the kinds of objects (types) assumed to exist in the grammar. Processing typically involves combining information about pieces of the input by unification. From this perspective, the need for robustness can be seen as arising because pieces of the input provide information which is inconsistent with information from other pieces of the input and/or from the grammar. The first inconsistency is tolerated --- it does not violate the grammar --- and processed using "robust types" which are created by extending the signature to a lattice. Inconsistency with the grammar on the other hand is punished by stripping away the offending information. Weights, added to it on the basis of the grammar, also disappear, thus making the ungrammaticality measurable. The conceptual and formal apparatus for this is developed and exemplified in the third part of the dissertation.},

We apply this method to the NEGRA treebank to derive an LTAG grammar of German. We describe the methodology and tools for structure conversion and LTAG extraction. The conversion and grammar extraction process imports linguistic generalisations that are missing the in original treebank. This supports the extraction of a linguistically sound grammar with maximal generalisation, as well as grammar induction techniques to capture unseen data in stochastic parsing. We further illustrate the flexibility of our conversion method by deriving an alternative representation in terms of topological field marking from the NEGRA treebank, which can be used as input for stochastic topological parsing approaches. On a broader perspective our approach contributes to a better understanding on where corpuslinguistics and theoretical linguistics can meet and enrich each other.},

   Address= {Athens, Greece},
   Note  = {in October},
   Abstract = {A long-standing puzzle in coordination is the so-called SGF-coordination (Subject Gap in Finite/Fronted constructions) in German (1), first discussed b y (Hoehle 1983). Its syntactic analysis is challenging, since the subject (Jaeger, man) is realised in the middle field in the left conjunct, and is thus - under standard analyses of constituent coordination - not accessible from within the second conjunct, which is missing a subject (hence "subject gap").

Takes one the cover off and stirrs the stuffing, steam rises. 
If one takes the cover off and stirrs the stuffing, steam will rise. 

SGF constructions have been analysed in terms of asymmetrically embedded conjuncts (Wunderlich 1988, Hoehle 1990, Heycock and Kroch 1993, Buering und Hartmann 1998) or symmetric conjuncts (Steedman 
1990, Kathol 1995,1999). Asymmetric embedding is problematic as it involves extraction asymmetries, or a doubtful analysis of coordination as adjunction. Symmetric analyses assume special licensing conditions which are not independently motivated. Especially the word order conditions of Kathol's analysis lack any independent syntactic motivation, and fail to account for related asymmetric coordinations of verb-last and verb-fronted (VL/VF) sentences (2).

If you enter a shop and (you) don't have any money, you can't buy anything. 

We present a multi-factorial LFG analysis of asymmetric constructions (1) and (2), which relies on independently motivated principles of the correspondences between c-structure, f-structure, and i-structure (information structure). 
SGF coordination is analysed as symmetric coordination in c-structure. Binding of the (prima facie) inaccessible subject of the first conjunct is enabled, at the level of f-structure, by asymmetric projection of a "grammaticalised discourse function GDF", a topic or subject function (Bresnan, 2001). "Asymmetric GDF projection" is motivated by relating the semantic and discourse-functional properties of asymmetric coordination to well-known discourse subordination effects of modal subordination. In conjunction with 
word order constraints in the optimality model of (Choi 1999, 2001), our analysis explains some mysterious word order constraints as well as some puzzling scoping properties.},

Grammar) based on the notion of derivation (tree)s. We argue that derivation structures in
LTAG are not appropriate to guide semantic composition, due to a non-isomorphism, in LTAG,
between the syntactic operation of adjunction on the one hand, and the semantic operations of complementation and modifcation, on the other.
Linear Logic based "glue semantics", as developed within the LFG framework (cf. Dalrymple
(1999)), allows for flexible coupling of syntactic and semantic structure. We investigate application of glue semantics to LTAG syntax, using as underlying structure the derived tree, which is more appropriate for principle-based semantics construction. We show how Linear Logic based semantics construction helps to bridge the non-isomorphism between syntactic and semantic operations in LTAG. The glue approach captures non-tree local dependencies in control and modifcation structures, and extends to the treatment of scope ambiguity with quantified NPs and VP modifers. Finally, glue semantics applies successfully to the adjunction-based analysis of long-distance dependencies in LTAG, which differs signifcantly from the f-structure based analysis in LFG.},

[Mann/Thompson 1988, Scha/Polanyi 1988, Webber 1991, Gardent 1991, Pruest 1992]) that discourse has a tree structure which reflects the semantic structure of discourse. In this paper, I argue that this claim is problematic in cases of discourse multiple dependencies i.e. cases where one discourse segment is semantically related to two discourse segments. I develop a discourse framework which is based on [Scha/Polanyi 1988] but integrates ideas from Feature-based Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAGs). I then show that this new framework adequately captures multiple dependencies whilst retaining the precise linguistic predictions made by the discourse grammar. In particular, I show how it permits a simple modelling of discourse semantics, discourse coherence and discourse based constraints on anaphora resolution.},

We start by presenting the specific framework being used (discourse grammar), and we argue that it provides a natural setting for a computational analysis of intersentential phenomena such as ellipsis, anaphora and focus. We then show that it is possible for a discourse grammar to be neither monotonic nor declarative and further, that a discourse grammar is not guaranteed to terminate even when the set of solutions to be found is finite. Finally, we argue that despite these non properties, a generator can be developed which both preserves the intended meaning of the grammar and terminates.},

When applied to deaccenting, the analysis makes a strong prediction, namely that all anaphors occurring in the deaccented part of a deaccented utterance are parallel anaphors that is, anaphors that resolve to their parallel counterpart in the source. I argue that this prediction is supported by the data and show that it correctly captures the interaction of deaccenting with anaphora, (in)definiteness and focus.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we describe a reversible framework for discourse processing, a framework in which contextual constraints can be specified independently of the processing algorithm. We take as a starting point Scha and Polanyi's discourse grammar ([Scha/Polanyi 1988]) which is in essence a unification based grammar extended with arbitrary relations. Although such a framework can be shown to have many non properties (e.g. non monotonicity and non declarativity), we argue that it is inherently finitely reversible in the sense of [Dymetman 1991] - that is, there is a parsing/generation program for this grammar such that for any string/semantics, the program enumerates all associated semantics/strings and terminates. We show by means of examples that one and the same specification can be used both for analysis and for generation.},

In this paper, we extend the unification-based approach to cases which are often seen as a test-bed for focus theory: utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions. We then show that the resulting analysis favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus (namely, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory) in that it correctly generates interpretations which these alternative theories cannot yield. Finally, we discuss the formal properties of the approach and argue that even though HOU need not terminate, for the class of unification-problems dealt with in this paper, HOU avoids this shortcoming and is in fact computationally tractable.},

   Abstract = {The performance of first-order automated reasoning systems has been steadily improving, stimulated in part by the availability of test suites of mathematical problems on which the systems can be tested, tuned and compared. But discourse understanding in Natural Language poses different inference problems than mathematics. In order to tailor automated reasoning systems to the needs of Natural Language understanding, similar test suites need to be developed. In this paper, we claim that several kinds of ambiguity in discourse can be resolved through automated reasoning checks for consistency, informativity and minimality. Future test suites should therefore include problems of these sorts. The overall goal then is to characterise the range of inference problems that discourse understanding gives rise to and that test suites should include.},

The 'questioning' pitch accent identified in Grice and Savino (1995) is found in QUERIES, most ALIGNS, tentative and reasonably confident CHECKS, and OBJECTS. It is absent from very confident CHECKS or ALIGNS, in which cases the intonation pattern used is indistinguishable from that used in statements. A tripartite subcategorisation of CHECKS, according to the degree of confidence of the speaker, is reflected in the intonation by differences not only in accent type, but also in phrasing, and presence  or  absence  of  deaccenting.},

We compare the intonation of tokens produced in task-oriented dialogues with those read aloud, both from sentence-lists and from paragraph-length texts in which the target question was integrated. Results show that although all questions have a rising pitch accent, L+H* (already shown to be the marker of interrogation in Bari Italian by Grice and Savino 1995), they differ in their phrase-final F0 contour. A final rise to a high endpoint was found in 78% of read but only in 13% of spontaneous tokens. These data indicate that care should be taken when extending results from reading intonation to that of spontaneous speech.},

   Abstract = {Ten MAP Task dialogues for Sofia Bulgarian (SB) and six for Hamburg German (HG) are recorded and analyzed by means of X-Waves Software Package. The discourse intonation features focused on are denial and convergence. It has been observed that for German denial can be integrated into discourse-listing through intonation: Ja-acknowledge and Nein-/Ne-denial moves are both manifested by intonation rises. For Bulgarian, intonation rises in answering moves occur only in the acknowledge subtype: rises in denials (Ne-) are associated with uncertainty and surprise. The HG Ne- and SB Ne-moves are resynthesized by means of PSOLA, twelve stimuli being obtained for SB and sixteen for HG. Two appropriate contexts marked for discourse-listing and follow-up moves are excerpted from the MAP Task and are included in perceptual tests whereby native speakers are asked to determine the appropriateness of each stimulus in relation to each context. 'The results for Bulgarian contradict our preliminary observations. 
Convergence is defined as the matching of corresponding movements in pitch ranges and signals sympathetic agreement with the other speakers point of view. The check: answer move sequence can be viewed as instantiating convergence and exemplifies both lexical and Fo movement repetition, especially where ellipted moves are concerned. The two resynthesized sequences for HG and SB respectively are Im Westen and Pravo nagore as manifested in check and answering contexts. As above, native speakers are expected to determine the appropriateness of each stimulus in relation to each context. It has been observed that the differences between checks and answering moves for both HG and SB are phonetically manifested and are also established as being relevant by the perceptual tests, yet they cannot be accounted for phonologically by tone alignment: convergence seems to attenuate the phonological differentiation between checks and answering moves.},

   Abstract = {While in many branches of linguistics monolingual reference corpora are widely used, e.g., in lexicography, in the construction of grammars and generally in empirical linguistic studies, in translation research as well as translation practice the concept of a parallel refernce corpus has not yet assumed a similarly important role. In our view, this is partly due to a lack of interaction of researchers involved in the development of corpus tools (computational linguistics, humanities computing) and the potential users of such tools in the area of translation (translatology, translation practice). The goal of the present paper is to initiate such an interaction. We present the design of an German-English and French-English translation corpus and explore its use as a reference corpus for translatologists as well as translators. First, we introduce the the basic computational techniques needed to build such a translation reference corpus. These techniques cover the preparation of the corpus as well as its linguistic annotation. In the preparatory step the corpus has to be aligned and encoded. To enrich the corpus with linguistic information, part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing have to be carried out for the different languages. Furthermore, to make the parallel reference corpus usable for translation scholars and translators, it has to be searchable, i.e., appropriate query facilities must be provided. We show how to extract instances of linguistic phenomena that are of interest from a translation point of view using a multilingual English-German-French corpus. We explain possible translation procedures for perfect aspect, reduced relative clauses and cleft constructions from English into German and French on the basis of parallel concordances extracted from the translation reference corpus. Finally, we specify some additional requirements to improve the usability of translation corpora in both translation studies and translation practice.},

   Abstract = {We define a practical algorithm for distributed rational tree unification and prove its correctness in both the off-line and on-line cases. We derive the distributed algorithm from a centralized one, showing clearly the trade-offs between local and distributed execution. The algorithm is used to realize logic variables in the Mozart Programming System, which implements the Oz language (see http://www.mozart-oz.org/). Oz appears to the programmer as a concurrent object-oriented language with dataflow synchronization. Logic variables implement the dataflow behavior. We show that logic variables can easily be added to the more restricted models of Java and ML, thus providing an alternative way to do concurrent programming in these languages. We present common distributed programming idioms in a network-transparent way using logic variables. We show that in common cases the algorithm maintains the same message latency as explicit message passing. In addition, it is able to handle uncommon cases that arise from the properties of latency tolerance and third-party independence. This is evidence that using logic variables in distributed computing is beneficial at both the system and language levels. At the system level, they improve latency tolerance and third-party independence. At the language level, they help make network-transparent distribution practical.},

   Abstract = {Much progress has been made in distributed computing in the areas of distribution structure, open computing, fault tolerance, and security. Yet, writing distributed applications remains difficult because the programmer has to manage models of these areas explicitly. A major challenge is to integrate the four models into a coherent development platform. Such a platform should make it possible to cleanly separate an application's functionality from the other four concerns. Concurrent constraint programming, an evolution of concurrent logic programming, has both the expressiveness and the formal foundation needed to attempt this integration. As a first step, we have designed and built a platform that separates an application's functionality from its distribution structure. We have prototyped several collaborative tools with this platform, including a shared graphic editor whose design is presented in detail. The platform efficiently implements Distributed Oz, which extends the Oz language with constructs to express the distribution structure and with basic primitives for open computing, failure detection and handling, and resource control. Oz appears to the programmer as a concurrent object-oriented language with dataflow synchronization. Oz is based on a higher-order, state-aware, concurrent constraint computation model.},

   Abstract = {We present a design for a distributed programming system, Distributed Oz, that abstracts away the network. This means that all network operations are invoked implicitly by the system as an incidental result of using particular language constructs. However, since network operations are expensive, the programmer must retain control over network communication patterns. This control is provided through the language constructs. While retaining their centralized semantics, they are extended with a distributed semantics. Distributed Oz is an extension of Oz, a concurrent state-aware language with first-class procedures. Distributed Oz extends Oz with just two concepts: mobility control and asynchronous ordered communication. Mobility control provides for truly mobile objects in a simple and clean way. Asynchronous ordered communication allows to conveniently build servers. These two concepts give the programmer a control over network communications that is both simple and predictable. We give scenarios to show how common distributed programming tasks can be implemented efficiently. There are two reasons for the simplicity of Distributed Oz. First, Oz has a simple formal semantics. Second, the distributed extension is built using network protocols that are natural extensions to the centralized language operations. We discuss the operational semantics of Oz and Distributed Oz and the architecture of the distributed implementation. We give an overview of the basic network protocols for communication and mobility.},

   Abstract = {This paper is about how to solve a class of puzzles, called self-referential quizzes (\textit{srq}), with constraint programming. An \textit{srq} is a sequence of multiple choice questions that are about the puzzle itself. \textit{srq}s are an attractive pastime, when they provide the possibility of drawing non-trivial conclusions on the way to the solution. We introduce a typical \textit{srq}, and represent it as a propositional satisfiability problem. Its straightforward clausal representation is too big for effective treatment using standard methods. Instead, we solve it with finite domain constraint programming. For this application of constraint programming, support of logic connectives such as conjunction and disjunction is crucial. With their small problem descriptions, \textit{srq}s are ideal candidates for benchmarks covering the implementation of 0/1 variables in constraint programming languages.},

   Abstract = {The programming language Oz integrates the paradigms of imperative, functional and concurrent constraint programming in a computational framework of unprecedented breadth, featuring stateful programming through cells, lexically scoped higher-order programming, and explicit concurrency synchronized by logic variables. Object-oriented programming is another paradigm that provides a set of concepts useful in software practice. In this thesis we address the question how object-oriented programming can be suitably supported in Oz. As a lexically scoped higher-order language, Oz can express a wide range of object-oriented concepts. We present a simple yet expressive object system, demonstrate its usability and outline an efficient implementation. A central aspect of Oz is its support for concurrent computation. We examine the impact of concurrency on the design of an object system and explore the use of objects in concurrent programming.},

   Abstract = {Nemhauser and Trick presented the problem of finding a timetable for the 1997/98 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in basketball. Their solution, found with a combination of integer programming and exhaustive enumeration, was accepted by the ACC. Finite-domain constraint programming is another programming technique that can be used for solving combinatorial search problems such as sport timetabling. This paper presents a solution of round robin tournament planning based on finite-domain constraint programming. The approach yields a dramatic performance improvement, which makes an integrated interactive software solution feasible.},

We argue that constraint programming provides a suitable technology for this task and that the libraries and tools available for the constraint programming system Oz effectively support the implementation of COMPOzE.

Exceptions are the languages CLAIRE and Oz, which support the programming of different search algorithms through special purpose programming language constructs. The goal of this work is to make abstractions for programming search algorithms available in a language-independent setting by using the concept of a room. Figaro is an experimentation platform being designed to study non-standard search algorithms, different memory policies for search (trailing vs copying), consistency algorithms, failure handling and support for modeling. Figaro is conceived as a C++ library providing abstractions based on the concept of a room. This paper focuses on the use and implementation of such abstractions for investigating programmable search algorithms and memory policies in a C++ constraint programming library.},

Yet it is of great importance, since unintended ambiguities arising from underrestricted rules or interactions haveto be distinguished from linguistically warranted ambiguities. In this paper we report on various tools in the XLE grammar development platform which can be used for ambiguity managementin grammar writing. In particular, we look at packed representations of ambiguities that allow the grammar writer to view sorted descriptions of ambiguity sources. Also discussed are tools forspecifying desired tree structures and for cutting down the solution space prior to parsing.},

   Abstract = {Although research in natural language generation has led to the development of numerous methods and reusable software tools, we feel that building comparably simple application systems still involves more hand-crafted skills than systematic methodology. In our view, this is due to the fact that most available tools are oriented towards contributing to a general purpose generation system rather than supporting the economic development of dedicated applications. In order to improve this situation, we present a methodology for developing application-oriented report generation with limited effort, emphasizing domain- and user-specific preferences over general-purpose communicative principles. Key parts in our approach comprise building an ontologically minimal initial representation on the basis of user parameters and associated domain data, the successive refinement of this initial representation by making implicit information explicit enough for fleshing out selected text and sentence patterns, and the opportunistic combination of linguistically motivated methods with template-based generation. This methodology should enable system developers to build application-oriented report generators more systematically and with reduced effort.},

   Abstract = {Alshawi and Crouch defined a simple multi-valued truth-conditional semantics for quasi logical form, a representation language for underspecified expressions. We incorporate this so-called monotonic semantics within the setting of plain propositional logic, and investigate the underlying calculi. It turns out that evaluation of ambiguous expressions with respect to a partial disambiguation, that is, possible readings maybe excluded on the moment of interpretation, yields the most attractive notion of validity in this setting. Besides the fact that it satisfies characteristic criteria of 'ambiguous reasoning', the underlying logic is also a suitable candidate as a minimal calculus for this task. Natural extensions of the calculus correspond to intuitive constraints on partial disambiguations. The paper presents this calculus and different extensions in a special Gentzen format, well-equipped for reasoning with 'multiple readings'. Two technical appendices contain the completeness proofs for the various calculi.},

   Abstract = {We present an implemented compilation algorithm that translates HPSG into lexicalized feature-based TAG, relating concepts of the two theories. While HPSG has a more elaborated principle-based theory of possible phrase structures, TAG provides the means to represent lexicalized structures more explicitly. Our objectives are met by giving clear definitions that determine the projection of structures from the lexicon, and identify maximal projections, auxiliary trees and foot nodes.},

   Abstract = {We outline an experimental machine translation system currently under development at the Institute for Computational Linguistics which aims at flexibility with respect to the level of transfer. The core of the system is a bidirectional transfer system using LFG-grammars for source and target languages. If translation is not possible on the basis of the linguistic information provided by the core system, i.e. in the case of translation mismatches, the system makes selective use of contextual and background knowledge. To this end we developed the concept of contextual constraints which are the interface between the core system and a module that we call the contextual resolver which deals among other things with the contextual information provided by the preceding text using Discourse Representation Theory. We concentrate on problems such as the translation of tense and anaphoric expressions between German and French.},

   Abstract = {The semantics of everyday language and the semantics of its naive translation into classical first-order language considerably differ. An important discrepancy that is addressed in this paper is about the implicit assumption what exists. For instance, in the case of universal quantification natural language uses restrictions and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is non-empty. On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak about hypothetical objects in everyday language. These problems have been discussed in philosophical logic and some adequate many-valued logics were developed to model these phenomena much better than classical first-order logic can do. An adequate calculus, however, has not yet been given. Recent years have seen a thorough investigation of the framework of many-valued truth-functional logics. Unfortunately, restricted quantifications are not truth-functional, hence they do not fit the framework directly. We solve this problem by applying recent methods from sorted logics.},

   Abstract = {It is well-known that many relevant aspects of everyday reasoning based on natural language cannot be adequately expressed in classical first-order logic. In this paper we address two of the problems, firstly that of so-called presuppositions, expressions from which it is possible to draw implicit conclusion, which classical logic normally does not warrant, and secondly the related problem of partiality and the adequate treatment of undefined expressions. In natural language, presuppositions are quite common, they can, however, only insufficiently be modeled in classical first-order logic. For instance, in the case of universal quantification one normally uses restrictions in natural language and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is non-empty. On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak about hypothetical objects in everyday language. Similarly, undefined expressions can be handled in natural language discourses and utterances are not only classified into the two categories 'true' and 'false'. This has led to the development of various better-suited many-valued logics. By combining different approaches we can now give a static description of presuppositions and undefinedness within the same framework. Additionally, we have developed an efficient mechanization of the induced consequence relation (which has been missing in the literature) by combining methods from many-valued truth-functional logics and sort techniques developed for search control in automated theorem proving.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes a tool for supporting grammar development in those linguistic frameworks which employ some constraint-based formalism, such as LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar), HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar), FUG (Functional Unification Grammar) and CUG (Categorial Unification Grammar). These approaches have in common that all or at least a substantial part of the grammar (such as rules, lexical entries, node labels etc.) is represented as sets of attribute-value pairs. 
In LISP or Prolog the structures can be internally represented as lists, but it is much more convenient and sometimes even indispensable to use graphical representations when developing grammars. During grammar processing, feature structures can become quite large (up to several thousand nodes), such that a customized view of the feature structure, which allows to selectively focus on relevant parts, becomes essential. Fegramed provides a fully interactive editor for developing, maintaining and viewing feature structures. It is a tool that is built to cope with the complexity of feature structures in grammar development and use.},

In an experiment for a midsize UBG, we show that our novel approach is feasible. Using unsupervised training, we achieve 88% accuracy on an exactmatch task.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we describe an effort to construct a catalogue of syntactic data, exemplifying the major syntactic patterns of German. The purpose of the corpus is to support the diagnosis of errors in the syntactic components of natural language processing (NLP) systems. Two secondary aims are the evaluation of NLP systems components and the support of theoretical and empirical work on German syntax. The data consist of artificially and systematically constructed expressions, including also negative (ungrammatical) examples. The data are organized into a relational data base and annotated with some basic information about the phenomena illustrated and the internal structure of the sample sentences. The organization of the data supports selected systematic testing of specific areas of syntax, but also serves the purpose of a linguistic data base. The paper first gives some general motivation for the necessity of syntactic precision in some areas of NLP and discusses the potential contribution of a syntactic data base to the field of component evaluation. The second part of the paper describes the set up and control methods applied in the construction of the sentence suite and annotations to the examples. We illustrate the approach with the example of verbal government. The section also contains a description of the abstract data model, the design of the data base and the query language used to access the data. The final sections compare our work to existing approaches and sketch some future extensions. We invite other research groups to participate in our effort, so that the diagnostics tool can eventually become public domain.},

   Abstract = {At all levels of linguistic analysis, natural language can be ambiguous. The numbers of readings of different ambiguous components of a sentence or discourse multiply over all these components, yielding a number of readings that can be exponential in the number of ambiguities. Both from a computational and a cognitive point of view, it seems necessary to find small representations for ambiguities that describe all readings in a compact way. This approach is called underspecification, and it has received increasing attention in the past few years. Lately, two particularly elegant formalisms for the underspecified treatment of scope ambiguities in semantics have been proposed: Context Unification and the Constraint Language for Lambda Structures, CLLS. Common to both is that they regard the term representing the semantics of a sentence as a tree and describe it by imposing tree constraints. Furthermore, both offer the expressive power to describe simple ellipses and their interaction with scope ambiguities. This thesis investigates some formal properties of these two formalisms. It examines their relation and shows that, except for a few additional constructs of CLLS, both languages are equivalent in expressive power. In terms of computational complexity, this gives us the immediate result that the complexity of the satisfiability problem of CLLS is exactly the same as that of context unification, which, unfortunately, is unknown. The thesis further investigates the complexity of the satisfiability problem of dominance constraints, an important sublanguage of CLLS, and shows that it is NP-complete. In the course of the discussion of complexity, it also briefly explains how techniques from concurrent constraint programming can be applied to implement solution algorithms for these formalisms.},

As scope underspecification is at least partially motivated by computational issues, we will pay particular attention to processing aspects. We're going to show how dominance constraints can be used for scope underspecification and how they can be processed efficiently by using concurrent constraint programming technology.},

The main idea is to derive sufficiently relaxed underspecified semantic representations; addition of reinterpretation operators then simply is further specialization. But in principle, relaxing underspecified representations bears the danger of overgeneration. In this paper, we investigate this problem in the framework of CLLS, where underspecified representations are expressed by tree descriptions subsuming dominance constraints. We introduce some novel properties of dominance constraints and present a safety criterion that ensures that an underspecified description can be relaxed without adding unwanted readings. We then apply this criterion systematically to Egg's analysis and show why its relaxation operation does not lead to overgeneration.},

We elaborate on the foundations of a recent approach to reinterpretation within a framework for semantic underspecification. In this approach, relaxed underspecified semantic representations are inferred from the syntactic structure, leaving space for subsequent addition of reinterpretation operators. Unfortunately, a structural danger of overgeneration is inherent to the relaxation of underspecified semantic representations. We identify the problem and distinguish structural properties that avoid it. We furthermore develop techniques for proving these properties and apply them to prove the safety of relaxation in a prototypical syntax/semantics interface. In doing so, we present some novel properties of tree descriptions in the constraint language over lambda structures (CLLS).},

MG ESPVCs include verbs like miso (hate), agapo (love), or latrevo (adore), which feature a nominative experiencer in agreement with the verb and an accusative theme (see examples (1)-(3)). MG ESPVCs include also predicates like fovame (fear), which feature an experiencer-subject in agreement with the verb and either an accusative theme (example (4)), or a theme as the object of a prepositional phrase (example (5)). We should underline here that examples (4) and (5) below convey the same meaning. That is, they do NOT differ semantically.
1. O   Gianis   misi    to  sholio.
2. the Gianis.N hate.3S the school.A
3. "John hates school."

The challenge that constructions like the ones in (4) and (5) pose lies on the split syntactic realization of the "experienced" (hence EXPD) semantic role (i.e., the theme), which in constructions like (4) is syntactically realized as the object of the sentence, while in constructions like (5) it is syntactically realized as the object of a prepositional phrase.
Our aim is to propose a unified linking account of the MG ESPVCs. This unified account 
1. is based on the assumption that the individual denoted by the object NP (or PP) of the MG ESPVCs is entailed to be semantically underspecified, and 
2. makes use of Wechsler's (1995) Notion Rule, Davis and Koenig's (2000) linking theory, as well as Markantonatou and Sadler's (1996) proposal for the linking of indirect arguments.},

We account for the semantic and syntactic properties of the constructions in (1)-(4) by relying on the linking architecture that Butt, Dalrymple, and Frank (1997) have proposed as an alternative to the fully deterministic principles of standard LMT. We show that the "optimal linking" theory makes the correct predictions for the linking of the EXPR ("experiencer") and the EXPD ("experienced") semantic arguments of Modern Greek (MG) Experiencer-Subject Psych Verb Constructions (ESPVCs) and predicts that the variant of MG ESPVCs which realizes syntactically the EXPD ("experienced") semantic argument as an accusative NP (examples (1) and (3)) ranks higher (is "more optimal") than the variant which realizes syntactically the EXPD ("experienced") semantic argument as the complement of a PP phrase (examples (2) and (4)). This ranking reflects in a way the fact that in order to express the meaning Mary is afraid of the storms native speakers prefer the construction in (1), rather than the one in (2), which is also mirrored in the rate of the marked variant of MG ESPVCs ((2) and (4)) in the Greek ECI corpus (5,568%).},

   Title = {Phonetic features in ASR: A linguistic solution to acoustic variation?},
   BookTitle = {Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Laboratory Phonology (LabPhon7), June 29 -July 1},
   Address= {Nijmegen, Netherlands},
   Abstract = {In most phonological theories, phonemes are considered as a set (or hierarchy) of (possibly underspecified) phonetic features, which are the minimal number of formal properties needed to distinguish the phonemes in the language system from each other. 

In most state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, however, phonetic features do not play any role. The statistical models for each phone or phoneme are based on a spectral parameterisation of the signals, like mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC's) and energy. 

Three questions are dealt with in this paper: 


Can we successfully bridge this gap between phonological theory and ASR by using phonetic features in ASR? 
Which phonetic feature set is most appropriate for ASR? 
Can we attain the same result by using more complex non-linguistic modelling? 
1. PHONETIC FEATURES IN ASR
To bridge the gap between phonologists' formal representation of the phoneme and the almost purely acoustic description of the signal used in ASR systems, we have used phonetic features to create statistical phone models for automatic speech recognition. The phonetic features were derived from the spectral representation of the signal used in most standard ASR systems (MFCC's + energy) by means of a neural network. 
Not only do we find a clear increase in the phoneme identification rate (see under 2 below) [1], the confusions between phonemes are also much easier to interpret, since phonemes which are confused are usually very similar in terms of the phonetic features they are made up of. This is not the case when acoustic parameters are used to create phoneme models [2]. 

2. DIFFERENT PHONETIC FEATURE SETS
It is not self-evident which set of phonetic features is most appropriate to describe phonological categories and the processes that operate on them, since the various feature theories have different phonological implications. To evaluate how appropriate the different feature sets are for application in an ASR system, we have used several different feature sets, both articulatory-phonetic (IPA) and phonological (SPE) [3]. We have so far compared the phoneme identification results for both underspecified and fully specified SPE features with those for the set of features used in the IPA to distinguish all phonemes. In addition, the results were compared to those in a standard ASR system using acoustic parameters (MFCC's) directly to create phone models. We found a clear improvement in the phoneme identification rate when phonetic features were used to model the phones, in comparison to directly using acoustic parameters. Underspecified SPE features led to the best performance (for multi-language Eurom0 data, without the use of a lexicon or language model) of all: 
acoustic parameters: 15.6% 
IPA features: 42.6% 
SPE features: 36.2% 
Underspecified SPE features: 46.1% 


In addition to the features sets reported so far, the phoneme identification results for articulatory features [4] will be reported and their relative merits will be discussed. 

3. VARIATION MODELLING VERSUS LINGUISTIC MODELLING
The acoustic-phonetic mapping in a neural network combines two advantages, namely 
1) variation modelling: different acoustic realisations of the same phoneme (e.g. allophonic variants) can be discerned by the neural network 

2) linguistic modelling: these different realisations are mapped onto more homogeneous, distinctive features 

Even if the neural network can reduce the variation in the input parameters for statistical modelling by mapping different acoustic realisations of a phoneme onto phonetic features, the question remains whether the same result can be reached by using a non-linguistic approach. Variation modelling can also be achieved by using more complex acoustic phoneme models (multiple mixtures per state in HMM), so that we do not necessarily have to make a mapping onto phonetic features to achieve this goal. A comparison of the performance of a standard system which does not use phonetic features with the performance of a system in which phonetic features are used to train the phoneme models shows the merits of using a signal representation derived from phonological theory.},

   Abstract = {In this article we discuss implementation of some fundamental phonetic ideas related to what we shall call "relational processing" in a cross-language consonant identification system. The term relational processing refers to the way vowel transitions play a role in the identification of neighbouring consonants. Two experiments are described: first, consonant identification results from a hidden Markov modelling experiment are presented for consonants plus the preceding and following vowel transitions, if present. The results are compared to a baseline experiment, in which the vowel transitions are not used in the identification of the consonants. In the second experiment, the acoustic parameters are first mapped onto phonetic features; this mapping is performed by a Kohonen network1. Since vowel transitions are considered to be particularly important for identification of the place of articulation of the neighbouring consonant, only the place features (and not the consonants' manner features or the phonetic features of the vowel to which the transitions belong) are derived for the vowel transitions. Separate hidden Markov models are trained for the consonants, for the vowel offset and vowel onset transitions which share all consonantal place-of-articulation features. Concatenations of these models form the phone-like recognition units (comparable to the concatenation of phone models for the recognition of words in a conventional ASR system) which are later used for consonant identification. The results are compared with a baseline experiment in which no acoustic-phonetic mapping is performed. The experiments show that relational processing improves the consonant identification results.},

   Abstract = {This article discusses the use of phonetic features in automatic speech recognition. The phonetic features are derived from acoustic parameters by means of Kohonen networks. Behind the use of phonetic features instead of standard acoustic parameters lies the assumption that it is useful to help the system to focus on linguistically relevant signal properties. Previous experiments using very simple hidden Markov models to represent the phones (with only one mixture for each state and without a lexicon or language model) have indeed shown that the phoneme identification rates on the basis of phonetic features were considerably higher than on the basis of acoustic parameters. When eight mixtures per state are used in hidden Markov modelling, the phoneme identification rates for three different sets of phonetic features were found to be lower than those obtained from a system in which the acoustic parameters are modelled directly. It is suggested that the results are still good enough, however, to further explore the use of phonetic features in a complete automatic speech recognition system: if each phone sequence representing a word in the lexicon is replaced by a sequence of underspecified phonetic feature vectors, the use of phonetic features in the acoustic decoding may have certain advantages.},

   Abstract = {By mapping acoustic parameters onto phonetic features, it is possible to explicitly address the linguistic information in the signal. For the experiments presented in this paper, we mapped cepstral parameters onto two sets of phonetic features, one based on the IPA chart and the other on SPE. As a result, the phoneme identification rates in a hidden Markov modelling framework increase from 15.6% for the cepstral parameters to 42.3% and 31.7% for the IPA and SPE features, respectively. Furthermore, for phonetic features the resulting confusions between phonemes are often less severe from a phonetic point of view. The theoretical implications of the differences are addressed.},

   Abstract = {This paper presents first results from a pilot study in which a set of voice parameters are computed from the EGG and microphone signals. It is investigated which of the voice parameters can distinguish between 5 speaker groups. The speaker groups are divided into normal speakers, breathy speakers and speakers with an organic pathology. Some of the parameters can distinguish between (some of) the 5 groups regardless of speaker sex, whereas other parameter do so only for male or female voices. The results of this study can be useful for the derivation of parameters which can be used for instance for the evaluation of voice therapy; the results can also indicate parameters which should be given special attention in a pre-screening of speakers with a high risk of developing a voice pathology, since a change in these parameters between consultations at the ENT clinic may indicate a development towards a pathological voice. The main goal of this pilot study is not so much the derivation of these parameters, though, as the development of a methodology to find parameters which distinguish between the 5 speaker groups. The method is immediately applicable to the investigation of distinctions between other pathological groups.},

   Abstract = {Typed feature formalisms (TFF) play an increasingly important role in CL and NLP.
Many of these systems are inspired by Pollard and Sag's work on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), which has shown that a great deal of syntax and semantics can be neatly encoded within TFF. However, syntax and semantics are not the only areas in which TFF can be beneficially employed.
In this paper, I will show that TFF can also be used as a means to model finite automata (FA) and to perform certain types of logical inferencing. In particular, I will (i) describe how FA can be defined and processed within TFF and (ii) propose a conservative extension to HPSG, which allows for a restricted form of semantic processing within TFF, so that the construction of syntax and semantics can be intertwined with the simplification of the logical form of an utterance.
The approach which I propose provides a uniform, HPSG-oriented framework for different levels of linguistic processing, including allomorphy and morphotactics, syntax, semantics, and logical form simplification.},

   Abstract = {This paper presents TDL, a typed feature-based representation language and inference system. Type definitions in TDL consist of type and feature constraints over the boolean connectives. TDL supports open- and closed-world reasoning over types and allows for partitions and incompatible types. Working with partially as well as with fully expanded types is possible. Efficient reasoning in TDL is accomplished through specialized modules.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we present a corpus-based study involving the linear order of subject, indirect object and direct object in German. The aim was to examine several hypotheses derived from Hawkins' (1994) performance theory. In this context it was crucial to examine whether and to which extend length influences the order of subject and objects. The analysis was based on data extracted from the annotated NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1998) and the untagged Frankfurter Rundschau corpus. We developed an analysis system operating on the untagged corpus that facilitates the acquisition of data and subsequent statistical analysis. We describe this system and discuss the results drawn from the analysis of the data. These results do not support the theoretical assumptions made by Hawkins. Furthermore, they suggest the investigation of other factors than length.},

Mis à part une méthodologie élaborée pour la construction de matériel de test, TSNLP a créé la plus grand base de données de jeux de phrases-test actuellement disponible pour le français, l'anglais et l'allemand.  En outre, ce projet a développé des outils qui facilitent la construction, le stockage et l'accès aux données. Les résultats de TSNLP seront publiques.

   Abstract = {Man kann die VP-Ellipse als rein semantisches Phänomen auffassen. Das bedeutet, daß man für die elidierte VP ein Denotat durch Zugriff auf die Bedeutung des Antezedens-Satzes bekommt. Einer zweiten Auffassung zufolge ist eine elliptische Konstruktion eine syntaktische Struktur, die implizites, d.h. phonetisch nicht realisiertes Material enthält. 
Unsere Arbeit besteht aus einem kritischen und einem konstruktiven Teil. Im kritischen Teil erläutern wir an konkreten Problemen die Lösungen, die bestimmte Theorien bieten können. Im konstruktiven Teil entwickeln wir eine Theorie, die die Idee aufgibt, daß Sätze mit VP-Ellipse Strukturen enthalten, die bis auf phonetisch nicht realisiertes Material vollständig sind. Wir nehmen an, daß diese Sätze interpretiert werden müssen. Der Rekonstruktionsprozeß findet sowohl auf der syntaktischen als auch auf der semantischen Ebene statt. Zuerst wird eine syntaktische Struktur rekonstruiert, die bezüglich der Skopushierarchie zwischen Quantoren und bezüglich der Koreferenz-Beziehungen nicht determiniert ist. Daraus wird eine semantische Proto-Repräsentation abgeleitet, die semantisch unterspezifiziert ist. Die semantische Ergänzung dieser Struktur erfolgt durch Regeln, die Parallelität zwischen dem Antezedens-Satz und dem elidierten Satz gewährleisten. Unsere Theorie ist auch auf Sachverhaltsanaphorik und auf Konstruktionen mit fokussierenden Gradpartikeln anwendbar.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the question whether phrasal comparatives should be given a direct interpretation, or require an analysis as elliptic constructions, and answer it with Yes and No. The most adequate analysis of wide reading attributive (WRA) comparatives seems to be as cases of ellipsis, while a direct (but asymmetric) analysis fits the data for narrow scope attributive comparatives. The question whether it is a syntactic or a semantic process which provides the missing linguistic material in the complement of WRA comparatives is also given a complex answer: Linguistic context is accessed by combining a reconstruction operation and a mechanism of anaphoric reference. The analysis makes only few and straightforward syntactic assumptions. In part, this is made possible because the use of Generalized Functional Application as a semantic operation allows us to model semantic composition in a flexible way.},

The major bottleneck for this, however, lies in the so far difficult and expensive modeling of lexical knowledge, extraction rules, and an ontology that together define the information extraction system. In this paper we present a bootstrapping approach that allows for the fast creation of an ontologybased information extracting system relying on several basic components, viz. a core information extraction system, an ontology engineering environment and an inference engine. We make extensive use of machine learning techniques to support the semi-automatic, incremental bootstrapping of the domain-specific target information extraction system.},

Oz is a concurrent, dynamically typed, functional language with logic variables, futures, by-need synchronization, records, feature constraints, and deep guard conditionals. The LVM supports light-weight threads, first-class procedures, exception handling, transients as generalization of logic variables, futures, and constraint variables, records and open records, and multiple computation spaces to implement the deep guard conditional. We discuss the modular, open, and extensible design of the LVM. Techniques for the efficient implementation of the store on standard hardware are shown. The LVM subsumes well-known virtual machines for functional, logic, and imperative languages.},

By-need synchronization makes it possible to synchronize a thread on the event that a thread blocks on a future. It is used to express dynamic linking and lazy functions.},

   Abstract = {Für die Darstellung syntaktischer Strukturen und der Art des Zugriffs darauf gibt es im wesentlichen zwei Modelle: Einerseits die integrativen Modelle, in denen eine einheitliche Datenstruktur für die Repräsentation und Manipulation der verschiedenen Ebenen bereitgestellt wird, andererseits die modularen Modelle, die verschiedene, auf die speziellen Anforderungen der Ebenen abgestimmte Formalismen bieten. In diesem Papier werden die beiden Arten von Modellen diskutiert. Es wird eine modulare Architektur vorgestellt, in der von einer genuin semantischen Ebene gezielt und in kontrollierter Weise auf semantisch relevante syntaktische Information zugegriffen wird. Die Syntax wird als abstrakter Datentyp realisiert, so daß die Semantikkonstruktion unabhängig von der konkreten Darstellung syntaktischer Information beschrieben werden kann. Für drei verschiedene Grammatikformalismen (GB, LFG, HPSG) wird die Syntax-Semantik-Schnittstelle betrachtet. Die allgemeinen Grundsätze der beschriebenen Architektur sind auf den Entwurf weiterer Schnittstellen zwischen linguistischen Teilsystemen anwendbar. Schließlich wird der Kompositionalitätsbegriff im Kontext dieses Modells problematisiert.},

The result is a dynamic semantics in which contexts consist of the parts of a scenario which have been brought to a hearer's attention. The contexts are structured by meta-level disjunction, corresponding to a set of situations where one is in attention but the hearer doesn't know which one, and meta-level conjunction corresponding to a set of situations which are simultaneously in attention. Data from bridging reference, disjunction, and telescoping is used to motivate the account, together with some of the data which has been used in the past to argue for and against situation based accounts of anaphora.},

   Abstract = {We discuss the extension of the standard logical rules (functional application and abstraction) in Categorial Grammar, in order to deal with some specific cases of polysemy. We borrow from Generative Lexicon theory which proposes the mechanism of coercion next to a rich nominal lexical semantic structure called qualia structure. 

In a previous paper we introduced coercion into the framework of sign-based Categorial Grammar and investigated its impact on traditional Fregean compositionality. In this paper we will elaborate on this idea, mostly working towards the introduction of a new semantic dimension. Where in current versions of sign-based Categorial Grammar only two representations are derived: a prosodic one (form) and a logical one (modelling), here we introduce also a more detailed representation of the lexical semantics. This extra knowledge will serve to account for linguistic phenomena like metonymy.},

The algorithm is based on a simple transformation that applies to any context-free grammar and guarantees that the result can be compiled into a finite automaton. The resulting grammar contains at most one new nonterminal for any nonterminal symbol of the input grammar. The result thus remains readable and if necessary modifiable. We extend the approximation algorithm to the case of weighted context-free grammars. We also report experiments with several grammars showing that the size of the minimal deterministic automata accepting the resulting approximations is of practical use for applications such as speech recognition.},

   Abstract = {We formulate a sequent calculus K and prove that it is sound and complete in a strong sense with respect to a class of feature structures. The proof of completeness involves proving, first, a general characterization of the conditions under which any sequent calculus (that permits unrestricted use of Gentzen's structural rules) is strongly complete with respect to a semantical interpretation. With this general characterization, we prove completeness of the sequent calculus as well as a uniform relativization of strong completeness under appropriateness conditions. This establishes various completeness theorems from the literature as applications of the results here. To demonstrate the generality of our result, we also prove, by exactly the same technique, the completeness of an intuitionistic version of the calculus with respect to a class of Kripke structures. We next turn to a proof theoretic result that is intimately related to completeness: cut elimination. We prove a version of cut elimination for the classical calculus under appropriateness conditions, and as a corollary that various fragments of the calculus are also sound and strongly complete. Finally, completeness of the fragments allows us to investigate a correspondence between certain information systems and certain calculi. With this, we show that Pereira and Shieber's Domain of Descriptions is sound and complete, but only in a weak sense, with respect to its intended semantics.},

In our experiments, we investigate various phonological grammars, which strongly differ in structure. A simple evaluation metric "word accuracy" supports grammar development by denoting an increasing performance for grammars enriched with linguistic structure. This evaluation, judging one single category shared by all grammars, is in strong contrast to PARSEVAL, which is designed for a single grammar evaluating (almost) all categories. Using a toytreebank, we show that the PARSEVAL measures are hard to interpret, since the results are inconsistent with one another. It turns out that evaluating only a limited number of categories (here only one single category) is a harder evaluation measure than measuring the precision of all occurring substructures of a grammar.},

We define a new system of set constraints over feature trees that is appropriate for the analysis of record structures, and we investigate its satisfiability, emptiness, and entailment problem. We present a set-based diagnosis for constraint logic programming and concurrent constraint programming as first-order fragments of Oz, and we prove that it correctly detects inevitable run-time errors. We also propose an analysis for a larger sublanguage of Oz. Complementarily, we define an Oz-style language called Plain that allows an expressive strong type system. We present such a type system and prove its soundness.},

At the lower end of the expressiveness scale there are atomic set constraints and Ines constraints (inclusions over non-empty sets) for both of which a cubic time satisfiability test is known. Recently, there has been increasing interest in entailment tests for set constraints. We prove that the entailment problem of atomic set constraints is coNP-hard. We also show that the entailment problem of Ines constraints is coNP-hard. This corrects a claim of polynomial complexity presented at CP'96. Our results suggest that a complete entailment test is not feasible even for simple classes of set constraints.},

We investigate decidability and complexity questions for fragments of the first-order theory of FT$_\lt$. It is well-known that the first-order theory of FT$_\lt$ is decidable and that several of its fragments can be decided in quasi-linear time, including the satisfiability problem of FT$_\lt$ and its entailment problem with existential quantification $$\phi\models E\ x1 ...

The satisfiability problem of FT$_\lt$ can be decided in cubic time, as well as its entailment problem without existential quantification. Our main result is that the entailment problem of FT$_\lt$ with existential quantifiers is decidable but PSPACE-hard. Our decidability proof is based on a new technique where feature constraints are expressed in second-order monadic logic with countably many successors SwS. We thereby reduce the entailment problem of FT$_\lt$ with existential quantification to Rabin's famous theorem on tree automata.},

Our relationship implies a new decidability result for feature logics, namely that the entailment problem of FT${}_\leq$ with existential quantifiers $\phi_1\models \exists x_1\ldots\exists x_n\ \phi_2$ is decidable. We also show that this problem is PSPACE-hard even though the quantifier-free case can be solved in cubic time.

We investigate the satisfiability problem of OF and show that it can be solved in polynomial time, and even in quadratic time in an important special case. We compare OF with Treinen's constraint system EF of feature constraints with first-class features, which has an NP-complete satisfiability problem. This comparison yields that the satisfiability problem for OF with negation is NP-hard. Based on OF we give a simple account of type inference for first-class messages in the spirit of Nishimura's recent proposal, and show that it has polynomial time complexity: We also highlight an immediate extension that is desirable but makes type inference NP-hard.},

   Abstract = {Dieser Artikel behandelt die Programmiersprache Oz und das ihr zugrundeliegende Programmiermodell. Oz ist eine nebenläufige Programmiersprache, die Constraintprogrammierung mit funktionaler und objektorientierter Programmierung verbindet. Oz ist als Nachfolger von Hochsprachen wie Lisp, Prolog und Smalltalk entworfen; diese Sprachen sind nur unzureichend für Anwendungen geeignet, die sowohl Problemlösungskomponenten enthalten, als auch Nebenläufigkeit und Reaktivität. Im Vergleich zu Prolog gibt Oz die Idee auf, dass Programme stets auch logische Spezifikationen sein müssen. Andererseits erlaubt Oz die flexible Programmierung von Inferenzmaschinen, deren Leistungsfähigkeit weit über das in Prolog Machbare hinausgeht. Damit steht insbesondere die Funktionalität von CLP-Sprachen wie CHIP bereit.},

   Abstract = {Aus der GB-Literatur (Bausewein, 1990) über freie Relativsätze ist bekannt, daß sich diese teilweise wie ihre Relativphrasen verhalten. Sie können Argumentpositionen des Verbs füllen. 

(1) a. Was er nicht kennt, ißt er nicht.
    b. Die da stehen, kennen wir nicht.
    c. Ich denke nach, über was ich nachdenken will.

Obwohl freie Relativsätze finite Sätze sind, werden sie entsprechend der syntaktischen Eigenschaften ihrer Relativphrase im Mittelfeld angeordnet. 
(2) Er hat, was er geschenkt bekommen hat, sofort in den Schrank gestellt. 

Freie Relativsätze können nicht nur wie in (1)-(2) als Komplemente auftreten. In Abhängigkeit von den Eigenschaften der Relativphrase können sie auch - wie in (3) - als Modifikator fungieren. 
(3) Wo du schläfst, ist es laut.

Ich zeige, daß freie Relativsätze zu einer Kategorie projizieren, die in einer engen Beziehung zu den lokalen Eigenschaften der Relativphrase steht. Diese Beziehung wird durch eine Relation, die im wesentlichen einer komplexen Disjunktion entspricht, implementiert. Die Relation beschreibt sowohl die syntaktischen als auch die semantischen Regelmäßigkeiten, die sich bei freien Relativsätzen beobachten lassen. Entsprechend bestimmter Argumenthierarchien können auch Argumentpositionen gefüllt werden, die von der syntaktischen Kategorie der Relativphrase abweichen. 
(4) Wen solche Lehren nicht erfreun, verdienet nicht, ein Mensch zu sein. (Zauberflöte)

Wie Ingria (1990) gezeigt hat, stellt die unterschiedliche Kasuszuweisung im Relativsatz und im Matrixsatz, wie sie z.B. in (1b) vorliegt, ein Problem für Unifikationsgrammatiken dar. Ich zeige, daß Ingrias Ansatz nicht mit anderen Annahmen innerhalb der HPSG-Theorie vereinbar ist und schlage eine andere Lösung für das Problem vor. 

Im Allgemeinen gibt es drei Möglichkeiten, Sätze wie (1)-(3) zu analysieren: einen leeren Kopf, ein unäres Schema und eine lexikalische Regel. Im Aufsatz wird gezeigt, daß die Daten gegen die lexikalische Regel sprechen und es wird erklärt, wo die Vorteile des unären Schemas gegenüber dem leeren Kopf liegen. 


Zum Abschluß noch ein Beispielsatz, der auch in Deutsche Syntax Deklarativ vorkommt: 

(5) Was bei Ingria ein Subsumptionstest ist, ist bei Dalrymple und Kaplan ein Enthaltenseinstest.},

In this paper I discuss several possibile analyses for constituent order in German. Approaches that assume continuous constituents are compared with an approach that assumes discontinuous constituents. I will show that certain proposals that have been made to analyze constituent order are either not adequate or cannot be implemented with currently availible systems. For the proposals that can be implementd I will discuss the amount of work a parser has to do. I then compare two implementations of larger fragments of German: the Verbmobil grammar and the Babel grammar. It is shown that the amount of work to be done to parse the Verbmobil grammar is significantly higher then the work that has to be done parsing with the Babel grammar.},

   Abstract = {In German there is a class of verbs that can appear discontinuously (1). 
The part that appears to the left of the main verb in verb final position and that is stranded when the finite verb is in initial position is traditionally called a separable prefix. Since prefixes are by definition not separable, the terms particle and preverb are used in more recent work. 
(1) a. Setzt der Fährmann Karl über? 
takes the ferryman Karl across 
'Does the ferryman take Karl across?' 
b. daß der Fährmann Karl übersetzt. 
that the ferryman Karl across.takes 
In (1a), where the verb is in initial position, the preverb is stranded. 
Below I will argue that separable verbs in German behave like other elements in the predicate complex. This view is supported by the following facts: Preverbs are serialized like verbal or predicative adjectival complements in the right sentence bracket (the right periphery of a clause that does not contain extraposed elements), they can be fronted as can be done with single verbs or predicative adjectives. If preverbs are analyzed as part of the predicate complex, the fronting data can be accounted for as an instance of complex fronting (Partial Verb Phrase Fronting (PVP)). The inability of particles and predicates in resultative constructions to co-occur and the non-iterability of preverbs will be explained by the fact that particles and resultative predicates occupy a designated valance position that does not allow more than one particle Grammatical Interfaces in HPSG.},

   Abstract = {In dem Buch entwickle ich eine Theorie der komplexen Prädikate, die normale Kopulakonstruktionen, kohärente Infinitive einschließich der AcI-Konstruktionen, Subjekt- und Objektprädikative, Resultativkonstruktionen und Partikelverben erfaßt. 

(1) Er fährt das Auto kaputt / zu Schrott.

(2) Er ißt das Fleisch roh.

Zur Abgrenzung der Resultativkonstruktionen (1) von anderen sekundäre Prädikaten wird auch auf depiktive Prädikate (2) eingegangen und eine entsprechende Analyse für diese entwickelt. Ich zeige, daß depiktive Prädikate als Adjunkte zu behandeln sind, die mit einem Element in der Argumentstruktur des Verbs, das sie modifizieren, koindiziert sind. Ich zeige auch, daß die Elemente in der Argumentstruktur des Verbs je nach ihrer Obliqueness als Antezedenten unterschiedlich gut geeignet sind. 
Im Teil, der sich mit Partikelverben beschäftigt, argumentiere ich, daß sich Verbzusätze wie andere Teile das Prädikatskomplexes verhalten. Sie werden wie Verben in der rechten Satzklammer angeordnet (3)-(4), können wie Adjektive oder Verben einzeln im Vorfeld stehen (5) oder bei Fokussierung wie Adjektive auch im Mittelfeld links vom Verbalkomplex angeordnet werden. 

(3) Karl kommt abends in Berlin an.

(4) Karl kommt abends in der Stadt an, in der ich wohne.

(5) Fest steht, daß Karl nicht der Mörder war.

Es scheint also angebracht zu sein, die Verbzusatz-Verb-Konstruktionen syntaktisch wie Verbalkomplexe, also in der Syntax, zu behandeln. Wenn Verbzusätze analog zu anderen Elementen des Verbalkomplexes behandelt werden, kann (5) als Falle von (Partial) Verb Phrase Fronting behandelt werden. Für nicht-transparente Partikelverben nehme ich Lexikoneinträge an, die denen von verbalkomplexbildenden Verben ähneln. Lexikoneinträge, die in transparente Partikelverbkombinationen verwendet werden, werden durch Lexikonregeln lizensiert. 

Bei Behandlung der Partikeln als eigenständige syntaktische Einheiten stellt sich natürlich die Frage, wie die morphologischen Fakten, insbesondere die Derivation erklärt werden kann. In einer breiten empirischen Untersuchung werden Ähnlichkeiten zur Derivation mit Resultativkonstruktionen aufgezeigt und es wird deutlich gemacht, daß weder bei Resultativkonstruktionen noch bei Partikelverben Listedness für die Derivation entscheidend ist. Produktive Partikel-Verb-Verbindungen und die eindeutig syntaktischen Resultativkonstruktionen treten z.B. in ähnlicher Weise in vielen Nominalisierungsformen auf. Zur Beschreibung von Flexion und Derivation nehme ich Lexikonregeln an, die Stämme auf flektierte Formen bzw. Stämme auf andere Stämme abbilden. Im Fall der Partikelverben wird ein Stamm, der für eine Partikel subkategorisiert ist, durch Flexionsregeln auf ein Wort abgebildet, das dann in der Syntax mit der Partikel kombiniert werden kann. Alternativ kann der Stamm aber auch durch eine Derivationsregel auf einen anderen Stamm abgebildet werden, dieser Stamm muß dann natürlich auch flektiert werden. Da der Stamm für die Partikel subkategorisiert ist, haben Derivationsregeln Zugriff auf Information, die von der Partikel begesteuert wird (z.B. semantische Information bzw. Information über zusätzliche Komplemente zusätzliche Komplemente). Die vieldiskutierten Klammerparadoxa existieren für diesen Ansatz nicht. Mächtig Mittel wie Umklammerung (Rebrackating) werden nicht benötigt. 

Die Daten aus dem in diesem Buch enthaltenen Kapitel über Partikelverben wurden teilweise auf der HPSG 99 und dem Partikelverbworkshop in Leipzig präsentiert. Die Passivanalyse mit Lexikonregeln wurde auf der HPSG 2000 in Berkeley vorgestellt. Über komplexe Prädikate und Partikelverben habe ich auf der GGS 2000 in Potsdam vorgetragen. Über eine Lösung der Klammerparadoxa in der morphologischen Analyse der Partikelverben habe ich auf der HPSG 2001 in Trondheim gesprochen und die Analyse für depiktive Prädikate wurde auf der FG 2001 in Helsinki vorgestellt.},

The case theory that is developed in the paper builds on work done by Heinz and Matiasek (1994). Their approach is improved in such a way that case assignent in coherent constructions like (1) works properly. 

(1) Er sieht den Mann  den Wagen reparieren.

In the paper, I propose a more structured case feature and appropriate lexical entries to analyze these sentences. 
Apart from that it is explained how the case assignment in adjectival and participal environments works and the case assignment to non-realized subjects as in (4) will be explaind.

   Abstract = {Inflectional affixes are sensitive to morphological properties of the elements they attachto. Therefore Bierwisch (1987) suggested that the inflectional material is combinedwith both the verbal stem of simplex verbs and the verbal stem of particle verbs. Heargued that this leads to the bracketing paradox in the case of particle verbs since thesemantic contribution of the inflectional information scopes over the semantic contri-bution of the complete particle verb. This paradox will be discussed in section 2.1.In section 2.2, I will discuss nominalizations and adjective derivation, which are alsoproblematic because of various bracketing paradoxes. In section 3 I will suggest a solu-tion to these apparent paradoxes that assumes that inflectional and derivational prefixesand suffixes always attach to a form of a stem that contains the information about a pos-sible particle already, but without containing a phonological realization of the particle.The particle is a dependent of the verb and is combined with its head after inflectionand derivation. With such an approach no rebracketing for the analysis of particle verbsmechanisms are necessary.},

   Abstract = {Combinatorial problems can be efficiently tackled with constraint programming systems. The main tasks of the development of a constraint-based application are modeling the problem at hand and subsequently implementing that model. Typically, erroneous behavior of a constraint-based application is caused by either the model or the implementation (or both of them). Current constraint programming systems provide limited debugging support for modeling and implementing a problem. This paper proposes the Constraint Investigator, an interactive tool for debugging the model and the implementation of a constraint-based application. In particular, the Investigator is targeted at problems like wrong, void, or partial solutions. A graph metaphor is used to reflect the constraints in the solver and to present them to the user. The paper shows that this metaphor is intuitive and that it scales up to real-life problem sizes. The Constraint Investigator has been implemented in Mozart Oz. It complements other constraint debugging tools as an interactive search tree visualizer, forming the base for an integrated constraint debugging environment.},

   Abstract = {This paper proposes to promote constraints to first-class status. In contrast to constraint propagation, which performs inference on values of variables, first-class constraints allow reasoning about the constraints themselves. This lets the programmer access the current state of a constraint and control a constraint's behavior directly, thus making powerful new programming and inference techniques possible, as the combination of constraint propagation and rewriting constraints à la term rewriting. First-class constraints allow for meta constraint programming. Promising applications in the field of combinatorial optimization include early unsatisfiability detection, constraint reformulation to improve propagation, garbage collection of redundant but not yet entailed constraints, and finding minimal inconsistent subsets of a given set of constraints for debugging immediately failing constraint programs. We demonstrate the above-mentioned applications by means of examples. The experiments were done with Mozart Oz but can be easily ported to other constraint solvers.},

   Abstract = {We report on the extension of the concurrent constraint language Oz by constraints over finite sets of integers. Set constraints are an important addition to the constraint programming system Oz and are very employable in natural language processing and general problem solving. This extension profits much from its integration with the existing constraint systems over finite domains and feature trees, as well as from the availability of first-class procedures. This combination of features is unique to Oz. This paper focuses on the expressiveness gained by set constraints and on the benefits of the integration with finite domain constraints. A number of case studies demonstrates programming techniques exploring these advantages.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes a C++ interface for the concurrent constraint language Oz to implement non-basic constraints as propagators. The programmer benefits from the advantages of a high-level language, like elegant and concise coding, in conjunction with efficiency. For the user it is transparent whether a constraint is implemented by an Oz procedure or through the interface. The interface is completely separated from the underlying Oz implementation. Moreover, it frees the user from tedious tasks like suspending and waking up constraints. The overall efficiency of the resulting system is comparable to existing finite domain systems. For scheduling applications we demonstrate how algorithms from Operations Research can be incorporated, which allows to obtain results comparable to commercially available systems.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes the extension of a concurrent constraint programming (CCP) language with an interface to define new finite domain constraints efficiently. While the extension is implemented for the CCP language Oz, the described interface is well-suited to be also applied to other CCP languages and even to Prolog-based implementations with coroutining. The interface is easily extendable to other constraint systems as done for set constraints. Constraints are implemented as instances of C++ classes, so-called propagators. Propagators are completely separated from the runtime system. The supplied abstractions are as high-level as to hide away issues like suspension handling but provide an expressiveness adequate to implement global constraints employing advanced algorithmic techniques. This allows to solve demanding combinatorial problems, as for instance scheduling problems. The presented interface exploits specific features of Oz, like equality constraints and local computation spaces, but avoids to bother the programmer with implementation details of these features.},

   Abstract = {Solving large and hard discrete combinatorial problems often requires the design of new constraints. Current constraint systems focus on either high-level modeling or efficient implementation technology. While each approach lacks the advantages of the other one, this paper describes the combination of them in the high-level concurrent constraint language Oz. We describe an interface to Oz providing abstractions to program new efficient constraints in CPP, preserving the benefits of Oz for problem modeling. While constraints and the Oz runtime system are linked through the interface, and adequate interface abstractions are supplied to implement advanced algorithmic techniques. In particular, it provides the means to reflect the validity of a constraint and to control and inspect the state of a constraint. This allows the user to solve demanding combinatorial problems, such as hard scheduling problems. It is desirable to execute concurrent constraint programs in parallel to profit from multiprocessor architectures. We discuss how the proposed interface can be adapted to parallel execution, avoiding the recoding of constraint implementations for sequential solvers.},

For the bulk of programming constructs, however, working with reflexive domains is an unnecessary complication. In this paper we shall use the domains of ordinary classical type logic to provide the semantics of a simple programming language containing choice and recursion. We prove that the rule of Scott Induction holds in this new setting, prove soundness of a Hoare calculus relative to our semantics, give a direct calculus C on programs, and prove that the denotation of any program P in our semantics is equal to the union of the denotations of all those programs L such that P follows from L in our calculus and L does not contain recursion or choice.},

We present empirical data comparing the respective methods. The methods are relevant for systems in which wordgraphs form the input to kinds of syntactic analysis that are very time consuming, such as unification parsing.},

Our evidence is based on complexity results for the representation of regular languages.},

In natural language processing, this problem arises in several areas of application, including natural language generation, speech recognition and machine translation. We present two tabular algorithms for parsing of nonrecursive contextfree grammars, and show that they perform well in practical settings, despite the fact that this problem is PSPACE complete.},

Through this exercise we attempt to gain further insights into the nature of the two theories and to identify correlating concepts. While HPSG has a more elaborated lexicalized and principle-based theory of functor argument structures, TAG provides the means to represent lexical-based structural information more explicitly and to factor out recursion. Our objectives are met by giving clear and simple definitions for projecting structure from the lexicon, for determining "maximal" projections, and for identifying potential auxiliary trees and foot nodes.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes the Disco DEVELOPMENT SHELL, which serves as a basic tool for the integration of natural language components in the Disco project, and its application in the COSMA system, a Cooperative Schedule Management Agent. Following an object oriented architectural model we introduce a two-step approach, where in the first phase the architecture is developed independently of specific components to be used and of a particular flow of control. In the second phase the "frame system" is instantiated by the integration of existing components as well as by defining the particular flow of control between these components. Because of the object-oriented paradigm it is easy to augment the frame system, which increases the flexibility of the whole system with respect to new applications. The development of the COSMA system will serve as an example of this claim.},

In situations of communication where the generation of ambiguous utterances should be avoided our method is able to compute an unambiguous utterance for a given semantic input. The proposed method is based on a very strict integration of parsing and generation. During the monitored generation step, a previously generated (possibly) ambiguous utterance is parsed and the obtained alternative derivation trees are used as a "guide" for re-generating the utterance. To achieve such an integrated approach the underlying grammar should be reversible.},

   Abstract = {Many different constraint programming (CP) systems exist today. For each CP system, there are many different filtering algorithms. Researchers and developers usually choose a CP system of their choice to implement their filtering algorithms. To use these filtering algorithms on another system, we have to port the code over. This situation is clearly not desirable. In this paper, we propose a generic C++ interface for writing filtering algorithms called GIFT (Generic Interface for FilTers). By providing the generic interface on different CP systems, we can reuse any filtering algorithms easily. A case study on reusing scheduling filtering algorithms between Mozart and Figaro further highlights the feasibility of this approach.},

   Abstract = {We investigate functional computation as a special form of concurrent computation. As formal basis, we use a uniformly confluent core of the pi-calculus, which is also contained in models of higher-order concurrent constraint programming. We embed the call-by-need and the call-by-value lambda-calculus into the pi-calculus. We prove that call-by-need complexity is dominated by call-by-value complexity. In contrast to the recently proposed call-by-need lambda-calculus, our concurrent call-by-need model incorporates mutual recursion and can be extended to cyclic data structures by means of constraints.},

If several concurrent actors compete for the same resource then at most one of them may succeed, whereby the choice of the successful actor is indeterministic.

A functional program is uniformly confluent in the sense that all its possible executions coincide modulo reordering of execution steps. In this paper, we investigate concurrent programs that are uniformly confluent and their relation to eager and lazy functional programs. We study uniform confluence in concurrent computation within the applicative core of the $\pi$-calculus which is widely used in different models of concurrent programming (with interleaving semantics). In particular, the applicative core of the $\pi$-calculus serves as a kernel in foundations of concurrent constraint programming with first-class procedures (as provided by the programming language Oz). We model eager functional programming in the $\lambda$-calculus with weak call-by-value reduction and lazy functional programming in the call-by-need amming in the $\lambda$-calculus with standard reduction. As a measure of time complexity, we count application steps. We encode the $\lambda$-calculus with both above reduction strategies into the applicative core of the $\pi$-calculus and show that time complexity is preserved. Our correctness proofs employs a new technique based on uniform confluence and simulations. The strength of our technique is illustrated by proving a folk theorem, namely that the call-by-need complexity of a functional program is smaller than its call-by-value complexity.},

   Abstract = {Tree descriptions based on dominance constraints are popular in several areas of computational linguistics including syntax, semantics, and discourse. Tree descriptions in the language of context unification have attracted some interest in unification and rewriting theory. Recently, dominance constraints and context unification have both been used in different underspecified approaches to the semantics of scope, parallelism, and their interaction. This raises the question whether both description languages are related. In this paper, we show for a first time that dominance constraints can be expressed in context unification. We also prove that dominance constraints extended with parallelism constraints are equal in expressive power to context unification.},

Context unification subsumes string unification and is subsumed by linear second-order unification. We obtain the following three new results. The satisfiability problem of equality up-to constraints is equivalent to context unification, which is an open problem. The positive existential fragment of the theory of one-step rewriting is decidable. The $\exists^*\forall^*\exists^*$ fragment of the theory of context unification is undecidable.},

   Abstract = {Subtype entailment is the entailment problem of subtype constraints for some type language. Understanding the algorithmic properties of subtype entailment is relevant to several subtype inference systems. For simple types, subtype entailment is coNP complete; when extended with recursive types it becomes PSPACE complete. Adding the least and greatest type renders subtyping non-structural. Whether non-structural subtype entailment is decidable is a prominent open problem. We characterize subtype entailment in automata theory. This yields a uniform proof method by which all known complexity results on subtype entailment in the literature can be derived. The main contribution of the paper is an equivalent characterization of non-structural subtype entailment in automata theory (by so called P-automata). On the one hand side, our characterization implies that several variants of non-structural subtype entailment are polynomial time equivalent (with or without contravariant function types or recursive types). This robustness result is new and nontrivial. On the other hand side, we believe that our characterization contributes an important and necessary step towards answering the open question on decidability of non-structural subtype entailment.},

   Abstract = {Entailment of subtype constraints was introduced for constraint simplification in subtype inference systems. Designing an efficient algorithm for subtype entailment turned out to be surprisingly difficult. The situation was clarified by Rehof and Henglein who proved entailment of structural subtype constraints to be coNP-complete for simple types and PSPACE-complete for recursive types. For entailment of non-structural subtype constraints of both simple and recursive types they proved PSPACE-hardness and conjectured PSPACE-completeness but failed in finding a complete algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the source of complications and isolate a natural subproblem of non-structural subtype entailment that we prove PSPACE-complete. We conjecture (but this is left open) that the presented approach can be extended to the general case.},

   Abstract = {Over the past few years significant progress was accomplished in efficient processing with wide-coverage HPSG grammars. HPSG-based parsing systems are now available that can process medium-complexity sentences (of ten to twenty words, say) in average parse times equivalent to real (i.e. human reading) time. A large number of engineering improvements in current HPSG systems were achieved through collaboration of multiple research centers and mutual exchange of experience, encoding techniques, algorithms, and even pieces of software. 
This article presents an approach to grammar and system engineering, termed competence & performance profiling, that makes systematic experimentation and the precise empirical study of system properties a focal point in development. Adapting the profiling metaphor familiar from software engineering to constraint-based grammars and parsers, enables developers to maintain an accurate record of system evolution, identify grammar and system deficiencies quickly, and compare to earlier versions or between different systems. 
We discuss a number of exemplary problems that motivate the experimental approach, and apply the empirical methodology in a fairly detailed discussion of what was achieved during a development period of three years. Given the collaborative nature in setup, the empirical results we present involve research and achievements of a large group of people.},

   Abstract = {Following high hopes and subsequent disillusionment in the late 1980s, the past decade of work in language engineering has seen a dramatic increase in the power and sophistication of statistical approaches to natural language processing, along with a growing recognition that these methods alone cannot meet the full range of demands for applications of NLP. While statistical methods, often described as 'shallow' processing techniques, can bring real advantages in robustness and efficiency, they do not provide the precise, reliable representations of meaning which more conventional symbolic grammars can supply for natural language. A consistent, fine-grained mapping between form and meaning is of critical importance in some NLP applications, including machine translation, speech prosthesis, and automated email response. Recent advances in grammar development and processing implementations offer hope of meeting these demands for precision. 

This volume provides an update on the state of the art in the development and application of broad-coverage declarative grammars built on sound linguistic foundations -- the 'deep' processing paradigm -- and presents several aspects of an international research effort to produce comprehensive, re-usable grammars and efficient technology for parsing and generating with such grammars.},

   Abstract = {The main stress of this paper will be put on description and explanation of certain phenomena concerning the "crossing dependencies" ("non-projective" constructions), but some more general implications of the proposals contained will be mentioned as well. To this end, two recent approaches to the problem will be reviewed and compared, which comparison creates actually the very core of the paper. 

The first of the appraches to description of crossing dependencies is presented in the paper "On Head Non-Movement" by Pollard. This approach tries to implant the "crossing" into the (syntactic) structure. To achieve this goal, it uses means resulting in changing the intuitive subcategorization requirements of words and phrases involved - actually a non-transformational analog of "raising". 

The second approach, put forward in the paper by Reape "A Theory of Word Order And Discontinuous Constituency in West Continental Germanic", keeps the immediate dominance relations (expressing subcategorization, among other) intact, and aims at describing the "crossing" phenomena by means of non-concatenative phonology. 

Unsurprisingly, it can be shown that, in the general case, neither of them is to be considered satisfactory alone, and that only a reasonable combination of the two can be hoped to cover the full range of data. Nevertheless, one of the approaches will be shown to be superior to the other as to description of their syntactically interesting part. Later some refinements and changes of this approach will be proposed (together with their motivations), with the aim of making the theory fit better the empirical data. 

The sketched approach is illustrated on certain constructions from German and Czech.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes a possibility of expressing ordering constraints among non-sister constituents in binary branching syntactic structures on a local basis, supported by viewing the binary branching structure as a list (rather than a tree) of constituents within HPSG-style grammars. The core idea of such a description of ordering is constituted by creating a type hierarchy for lists. The possibilities of expressing different approaches to word order in the framework are briefly discussed, exemplified and compared to other methods.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, we review the traditional term "word order freedom" and show that it can be understood in two ways: first, as the freedom of order of elements within a continuous head domain, and second, as the freedom of extraction out of a finite head domain, that is, as the freedom of making head domain(s) discontinuous. Further on, we concentrate on the more linguistical aspects of the latter understanding. In particular, we compare the pair of languages Czech and English, whose considerably different status as to the severity of constraints on ordering of elements within a continuous head domain of the finite verb is notorious, and aim this comparison at the possibilities which these languages offer for discontinuity of head domains. In this respect, we demonstrate that the two possible ways of understanding of word order freedom correlate, that is to say that English with its rather fixed order freedom within a continuos head domain also imposes severe constraints on extraction out of these domains, while Czech with its almost free order within a domain is also much more liberal as to extraction. The paper contains a longer discussion of this issue, together with a number of relevant examples from both languages.},

   Abstract = {The prevailing current view of a (symbolic, computational) grammar is basically that of a set of rewriting rules using featurestructured categories. However, whenever such a grammar is aimed at development of a real world applied project, at least two disadvantages become clear. First, it breaks with the traditional understanding of a grammar as a network of phenomena (such as agreement, subcategorization, etc.), thus impeding the (direct) incorporation of this knowledge into such grammars. Second, a realistic grammar is inevitably huge and simultaneously contains very complex interdependencies among rules. This makes any modularization of grammar engineering (aka division of labour within a team) and 
above all maintaining and debugging realistic grammars a virtually impossible task. 
This paper presents an alternative view of formal (computational) grammars of natural language allowing for smooth modularization of the grammarwriting process and hence for meeting the pressing task of distributed grammardevelopment. The examples of both problems and their solutions are related to 
grammars in HPSG style, however, the problems discussed are in no way HPSG specific, just on the contrary, they indeed concern any approach making use of feature structured categories.},

   Abstract = {Many of the methods developed for Western European languages and used widespread to produce annotated language resources cannot readily be applied to Central and Eastern European languages, due to the large number of novel phenomena exhibited in the syntax and morphology of these languages, which  these methods have to handle but have not been designed to cope with. The process of morphological  tagging when applied to Hungarian data to produce corpora annotated at least at the morphosyntactic level is most indicative of this problem: several of the algorithms (either rule-based or statistical) that have been used very successfully in other domains cannot readily be applied to a language exhibiting such a varied morphology and huge number of wordforms as Hungarian. The paper will describe a robust tagging scenario for Hungarian using a relatively simple stochastic system augmented with external morphological processing, which can overcome the two most conspcicuous problems: the complexity of morphosyntactic descriptions and most importantly the huge number of possible wordforms.},

In contrast to former approaches which assume that a coordinated structure is either a headless or a multi-headed structure, we take the position that the conjunction is a functional category which functions as the head of the coordinate phrase. Under this assumption, the internal structure of ordinary and complex coordinate constitiuents can be described with the existing inventory of principles and rules in HPSG. Coordination of unsaturated conjuncts is controlled by the lexical entry for the conjunction and without any additional rules or modifications.},

   Abstract = {This paper deals with linearization of complements of German verbs. In German all permutations of the subject, the indirect, and the direct object do occur. Yet, they are supposed to differ regarding their degree of acceptability. Uszkoreit (1987) proposed a set of rules which aimed at representing such preferences as the product of different factors. This theoretical account leads to a predicted ranking of the possible syntactic forms. In a set of experiments we tested some of these predictions by application of different methods for tapping into the actual processing of the sentences. In particular, the predictions were (a) that sentences are more acceptable if subjects precede objects than vice versa and (b) that sentences are more acceptable if indirect objects precede direct objects than vice versa. Both comprehension and production experiments were carried out. The methods we used included a ranking task, delayed sentence matching, delayed articulation, rapid serial visual presentation and a sentence generation task. The findings yielded a very consistent picture concerning the position of the subject. Sentences were particularly easy to process if the subject was in initial position and particularly hard to process in subject-final constructions. Furthermore, there is somewhat weaker evidence for the assumption that sentences are easier to process if direct objects are preceded by indirect objects. Since these results were obtained by rather different methods they can be regarded as particularly reliable. Moreover, the data did provide evidence for a gradual increase or decrease of acceptability and no evidence for a jump function, sharply separating grammatical from ungrammatical forms. One of the principal aims of this first phase of our investigations which is reported in the present paper was to find experimental methods which consistently differentiate between the various permutations of verb complements as predicted by theoretical assumptions. This aim could be achieved. The next step will be to include pragmatic factors which are supposed to play a significant role in determining the acceptability of the sentences we are studying.},

I will start with the inspection of specific phenomena and techniques which are usually associated with the notion of underspecification (in Section 1 and 2, respectively). In Sect. 3, I will try to indicate the main motivations for using underspecification techniques. Then, I will point out one important use of the concept in some detail, i.e., direct reasoning with incomplete semantic information, discussing first the appropriate truth-conditional basis (Sect. 4), and second perspectives on efficient reasonig systems (Sect. 5). I will conclude with some remarks about the general status of the semantic underspecification concept, in Sect. 6..},

Experiments were conducted with both types of grammars extracted from the NEGRA corpus. In spite of the much greater complexity of DPSG parsing in terms of the number of (partial) analyses that can be constructed for an input sentence, accuracy results from both experiments are comparable. We also briefly hint at future lines of research aimed at more efficient ways of probabilistic parsing with discontinuous constituents.},

Our technical contributions are (1) the semantical characterization of finite failure of logic programs over infinite trees and (2) the design and soundness proof of the first set-based analysis of logic programs with the greatest-model semantics. Finally, we exhibit the connection between finite failure and the inevitability of the 'inconsistent-store' error in fair executions of concurrent constraint programs where no process suspends forever. This indicates a potential application to error diagnosis for concurrent constraint programs.},

   Abstract = {Testing satisfaction of guards is the essential operation of concurrent constraint programming (CCP) systems. We present and prove correct, for the first time, an incremental algorithm for the simultaneous tests of entailment and disentailment of rational tree constraints to be used in CCP systems with deep guards (e.g., AKL or Oz). The algorithm is presented as the simplification of the constraints which form the (possibly deep) guards and which are situated at different nodes (or, local computation spaces) in a tree (of arbitrary depth). In this algorithm, each variable may have multiple bindings (representing multiple constraints on the same variable in different nodes). These may be realized by re- and de-installation upon each newly resumed check of the guard in the corresponding node (as done, e.g., in AKL or Oz), or by using look-up tables (with entries indexed by the nodes). We give a simple fixed-point algorithm and use it for proving that the tests implemented by another, practical algorithm are correct and complete for entailment and disentailment. We formulate the results in this paper for rational tree constraints; they can be adapted to finite and feature trees.},

Oz is convenient for concurrent programming like modelling multi-agent systems, as well as for solving combinatoric problems. PAMOz models the execution of a sublanguage of Oz without its constraint solving facilities. PAMOz has been implemented in the parallel Oz system, which is derived from the sequential Oz system and inherits its optimizations. PAMOz is targeted to shared-memory multiprocessors. PAMOz executes Oz threads in parallel. PAMOz is derived from AMOz, a sequential abstract machine for Oz. There are two principal differences between PAMOz and AMOz: the architecture of the abstract machine, and the implementation of operations on stateful data. PAMOz can be conservatively extended for full Oz; there is an interface between PAMOz and its constraint solving extension.},

   Abstract = {Teiltyp-Entailment ist die Frage, ob eine Implikation zwischen Teiltyp-Constraints $t_1\sm t_2$ gilt. Algorithmen, die diese Frage lösen, sind für die Vereinfachung von Teiltyp-Constraints relevant. Die Vereinfachung von Teiltyp-Constraints ist hingegen in contraintbasierten Typ-Sytemen dringend erforderlich. Die Komplexität von Teiltyp-Entailment hängt von der gewählten Typsprache ab; schon für ausdrucksschwache Typsprachen ist es überraschend schwierig, einen Algorithmus für Teiltyp-Entailment zu entwerfen. So ist Teiltyp-Entailment für einfache Typen coNP-vollständig und wird durch die Hinzunahme von rekursiven Typen PSPACE-vollständig. Entailment wird durch die Erweiterung um einen kleinsten und größten Typ nicht-strukturell. Henglein und Rehof haben bewiesen, daß nicht-strukturelles Teiltyp-Entailment, sowohl im einfachen wie auch im rekursiven Fall, PSPACE-schwer ist; einen vollständigen Algorithmus konnten sie allerdings nicht angeben. Es ist eine bekannte offene Frage, ob nicht-strukturelles Teiltyp-Entailment überhaupt entscheidbar ist. Ausgehend von dieser Situation untersucht diese Arbeit, worin die Schwierigkeiten liegen. Wir isolieren ein Teilproblem von nicht-strukturellem Teiltyp-Entailment, von dem wir zeigen, dass es PSPACE-vollständig ist. Damit zeigen wir zum ersten Mal Entscheidbarkeit für ein nicht-triviales Fragment von nicht-strukturellem Entailment. Wir charakterisieren Teiltyp-Entailment in der Automaten-Theorie; dazu erweitern wir das Konzept der endlichen Automaten zu sogenannten P-Automaten, deren Eigenschaften wir systematisch analysieren. Im nächsten Schritt reduzieren wir nun Teiltyp-Entailment auf das Universalitätsproblem von eingeschränkten P-Automaten. Für unser ausgezeichnetes Fragment können wir uns in der Tat auf endliche Automaten zurückziehen, deren Universalitätsproblem PSPACE-vollständig ist.},

The first part is a pilot study of the Rhenish Accentuation phenomena. It is an acoustic analysis of Accent 1 (also called "Stoßton") and Accent 2 (also called "Schleifton") words produced under different sentence-accent conditions in different intonation patterns. The second part is concernd with another tonal accent, sometimes called the "neutral accent", which is assumed, on the basis of auditory judgements, to exist in the dialect of Beuren. A pilot experiment tests the perceptual contribution of durational and tonal properties to the acceptability of this accent and of accent 2.},

The focus of this study is the phonetic basis of the plosives /p, t, k/ and /b, d, g/ in initial, medial and final position, i.e.: prevocalic / presonorant, intervocalic and postvocalic / postsonorant position, respectively. Interest in this subject stems from the different transciption conventions traditionally in use in the three Germanophone dialect regions of Lorraine: the Mosel-Franconian, Rhine-Franconian and transitional regions. Both an auditive evaluation and an instrumental analysis of the systematically elicited speech corpus, followed by a statistical analysis, support the choice of the phonetic symbols in phonologically non-relevant positions in the dialect under investigation.},

   Abstract = {Phonus 4, Institute of Phonetics, University of the Saarland, 1999, 103-121. In this paper the course of the therapy after minimally invasive laser surgery for a carcinoma of the vocal cord (T1) is evaluated using acoustic and electroglottographic methods. The evaluation includes preoperative, postoperative and post-rehabilitative conditions. With the help of frequency and amplitude perturbation parameters derived from the acoustic output, and parameters based on electroglottographic properties of single periods (contact and skewing quotient; jitter), respectively, we are able to provide statistical evidence for the effectiveness of the therapeutic measures. Comparisons with the tolerance values given by the producers of the analysis programs and with empirically derived variation ranges from a large sample of normal speakers allow us to quantify the effect. The course of the recovery, also described in this study, provides the anatomical and physiological basis to explain the functional improvement of phonation observed in the acoustic and electroglottographic correlates.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we address aspects of the interaction of global discourse parameters such as text type and subject matter with the selection of local features (e.g., thematic organization in terms of theme-rheme configurations) responsible for the appearance of the individual linguistic units the discourse consists of. Our starting point is the observation that the same propositional content often can be expressed linguistically by different lexical and grammatical means, for instance, by word order alternatives or by using different lexical categories. These alternatives result from the exploitation of a number of linguistic mechanisms (e.g., focussing, thematization) controlling the foregrounding and backgrounding of different parts of information communicated and differ in the pragmatic effects they achieve. Our interest lies in the textual-pragmatic motivations leading to the choice of a certain textual variant; in particular, we investigate the constraints global discourse structure imposes on sentence-level discourse organization. Proceeding from a stratificational model of the language system, our approach aims at the specification of interstratal constraints expressing the interdependency between higher-level discourse organization and lexico-grammatical realization on sentence level. A possible application area would be text generation where a notorious problem is the gap between global-level text planning and lexico-grammatical expression. The choice of grammatical (sentence) theme in German and its text type and domain dependency is taken as a sample phenomenon to illustrate our methodology.},

   Abstract = {Sentences read and imitated by four Korean learners of German, two "advanced" and two "beginners", containing selected two-, three- and four-syllable words were compared with readings of the same sentences by two native speakers of German. The words were also varied systematically in their complexity and in the familiarity of their syllable structure. They combined familiar and unfamiliar sounds with known [CV(son)] and unknown [C(C)VC(C)] syllables. The realisations by the Korean learners were analysed for deviations from the native productions with respect to pause behaviour, articulation rate, the duration of the selected words, and the relative syllable duration within those words. Results show that unfamiliar sounds, syllable structure and Korean syllable-dependent rhythmic patterning combine to interfere with the production of the correct German rhythm. As the length and the syllable complexity of the German target words increases so does the degree of deviation from the native German patterns. Length of exposure to German did not appear to guarantee a closer approximation to the target patterns, but all learners were able to modify their L2-productions in the imitation task.},

This inadequacy stems mainly from the usage of too restrictive and order-independent obliqueness-based hierarchies as constraints on possible binders and bindees. We propose binding constraints to be directly implemented as path equations/path inequations in thematic relation sorts. This allows a more fine-grained description of local binding symmetries and asymmetries via a modular interplay of general binding constraints on thematic arguments together with linear precedence constraints on certain anaphoric elements.},

Our approach is based on using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as the primary source of semantic data, whereby documents and queries are annotated with multiple layers of linguistic information. Linguistic processing includes POS-tagging, morphological analysis, phrase recognition and the identification of medical concepts and semantic relations between them. The paper describes experiments in mono- and bilingual document retrieval, performed on a parallel English-German corpus of medical abstracts. Results show on the one hand that linguistic processing, especially lemmatisation and compound analysis, is a crucial step to achieving good baseline performance. On the other hand we show that semantic information, specifically the combined use of concepts and relations, significantly increases performance in cross-lingual retrieval.},

   Abstract = {A method is given that 'inverts' a logic grammar and displays it from the point of view of the logical form, rather than from that of the word string. LR-compiling techniques are used to allow a recursive-descent generation algorithm to perform 'functor merging' much in the same way as an LR parser performs prefix merging. This is an improvement on the semantic-head-driven generator that results in a much smaller search space. The amount of semantic lookahead can be varied, and appropriate tradeoff points between table size and resulting nondeterminism can be found automatically. This can be done by removing all spurious nondeterminism for input sufficiently close to the examples of a training corpus, and large portions of it for other input, while preserving completeness.},

It has been tested on a part-of-speech tagging task and outperformed linear (deleted) interpolation even when the latter used a globally optimal parameter setting determined a posteriori. An asymptote is derived from Turing's local reestimation formula for population frequencies, and a local reestimation formula is derived from Zipf's law for the asymptotic behavior of population frequencies. The two are shown to be qualitatively different asymptotically, but nevertheless to be instances of a common class of reestimation-formula-asymptote pairs, in which they constitute the upper and lower bounds of the convergence region of the cumulative of the frequency function, as rank tends to infinity. The results demonstrate that Turing's formula is qualitatively different from the various extensions to Zipf's law, and suggest that it smooths the frequency estimates towards a geometric distribution.},

Some people think this shows that those theories are not dynamic enough and have suggested various remedies such as accommodation. In this paper I show how inference can provide for the missing antecedent in those problem cases even within the framework of existing dynamic theories. A natural deduction system working directly with Discourse Representation Structures is used to accomplish this.},

   Abstract = {Over the last few years, unification-based grammar formalisms have become the predominant paradigm in natural language processing systems because of their monotonicity, declarativeness, and reversibility. From the viewpoint of computer science, typed feature structures can be seen as data structures that allow representation of linguistic knowledge in a uniform fashion.
Type expansion is an operation that makes the constraints on a typed feature structure explicit and determines their satisfiability. We describe an efficient expansion algorithm that takes care of recursive type definitions and allows exploration of different expansion strategies through the use of control knowledge. This knowledge is specified in a separate layer, independently of grammatical information. Memoization of the type expansion function drastically reduces the number of unifications.
In the second part, nonmonotonic extensions to TDL and the implementation of well-typedness checks are presented. Both are closely related to the type expansion algorithm. The algorithms have been implemented in Common Lisp and are integrated parts of TDL and a large natural language dialog system.},

We present L for didactic reasons as an extension of a sublanguage of SML. The most important differences between L and SML are: logic variables, threads, synchronization and dynamic typing. Starting from an informal description of the dynamic semantics in terms of a graph model, we develop step by step on various levels of abstraction a virtual machine for L. We begin with a simple basic model. We then propose several optimizations of this model. Afterwards we keep refining our approach by addressing specific aspects of the implementation of the model. Finally we evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques using a set of larger real world applications. Further we show, that the implementation of the language is competitive with the fastest emulators for statically typed functional languages.},

   Abstract = {The paper shows how a recently introduced class of applications can be solved by constraint programming. This new type of application is due to the emergence of special real-time systems, enjoying increasing popularity in such diverse areas as automotive electronics and aerospace industry. These real-time systems are time triggered in the sense that their overall behavior is globally controlled by a recurring clock tick. For this off-line scheduling problem a potentially indefinite, periodic processing has to be mapped onto a single time window of a fixed length. We make this new class of applications amenable to constraint programming. We describe which traditional scheduling and real-time computing techniques led to success and which failed when confronted with a large-scale application of this type. Global constraints were used to reduce memory consumption and to speed up computation. An elaborate heuristic, borrowed from Operations Research, was employed to solve the problem. Furthermore, we show that mere serialization is sufficient to find a valid schedule. The actual implementation was done in the concurrent constraint programming language Oz.},

Efficiency: The project chose a so called 'lean' formalism, a termencodable language providing efficient term unification, ALEP. 
Coverage: The project adopted a corpusbased approach. 
Completeness: All modules needed from text handling to semantics must be there. 
The paper reports on a text handling component, Two Level morphology, word structure, phrase structure, semantics and the interfaces between these components. Mainstream approach: The approach claims to be mainstream, very much indebted to HPSG, thus based on the currently most prominent and recent linguistic theory.

Using copy synthesis, the prosodic structure of one sentence uttered with five emotional expressions (anger, joy, fear, sadness, and neutral) was transferred to synthetic stimuli. Perception tests show that for some synthetic stimuli, the high recognition rates for the corresponding natural stimuli are almost reproduced, while for other stimuli the emotional information is lost. In a free association perception test, a tendency towards the perception of the unintended category "disappointment" was found that only varied to a limited extend across stimuli.

Perzeptionstests zeigen, daß für manche Stimuli die hohen Erkennungsraten der entsprechenden natürlichen Stimuli nahezu reproduziert werden, während für andere Stimuli die emotionale Information verlorengeht.

Affect bursts are defined as short emotional non-speech expressions interrupting speech. This study shows that affect bursts, presented without context, can convey a clearly identifiable emotional meaning. Affect bursts expressing ten emotions were produced by actors. After a pre-selection procedure, good examples for each emotion were presented in a perception test. The mean recognition score of 81% indicates that affect bursts seem to be an effective means of expressing emotions. Affect bursts are grouped into classes on the basis of phonetic similarity. Recognition and confusion patterns are examined for these.

   Abstract = {The amusement expression is both visual and audible in speech. After recording comparable spontaneous, acted, mechanical, reiterated and seduction stimuli, five perceptual experiments were held, mainly based on the hypothesis of prosodically controlled effects of amusement on speech. Results show that audio is partially independant from video, which is as performant as audio-video. Spontaneous speech(unvolontary controlled) can be identified in front of acted speech (volontary controlled). Amusement speech can be distinguished from seduction speech.},

Using computation spaces, the paper covers several inference engines ranging from standard search strategies to techniques new to constraint programming, including limited discrepancy search, visual search, and saturation. Saturation is an inference method for tautology-checking used in industrial practice. Computation spaces have shown their practicability in the constraint programming system Oz.},

It uses the search tree of a constraint problem as its central metaphor. Exploration and visualization of the search tree are user-driven and interactive. The constraints of any node in the tree are available first-class: predefined or user-defined procedures can be used to display or analyze them. The Explorer is a fast and memory efficient tool intended for the development of real-world constraint programs. The Explorer is implemented in Oz using first-class computation spaces. There is no fixed search strategy in Oz. Instead, first-class computation spaces allow to program search engines. The Explorer is one particular example of a user-guided search engine. The use of recomputation to trade space for time makes it possible to solve large real-world problems, which would use too much memory otherwise.},

   Abstract = {A central service of a constraint programming system is search. In almost all constraint programming systems search is based on trailing, which is well understood and known to be efficient. This paper compares trailing to copying. Copying offers more expressiveness as required by parallel and concurrent systems. However, little is known how trailing compares to copying as it comes to implementation effort, runtime efficiency, and memory requirements. This paper discusses these issues. Execution speed of a copying-based system is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art trailing-based systems. For the first time, a detailed analysis and comparison with respect to memory usage is made. It is shown how recomputation decreases memory requirements which can be prohibitive for large problems with copying alone. The paper introduces an adaptive recomputation strategy that is shown to speedup search while keeping memory consumption low. It is demonstrated that copying with recomputation outperforms trailing on large problems with respect to both space and time.},

   Abstract = {Particles fullfill several distinct central roles in the Japanese language. They can mark arguments as well as 
adjuncts, can be functional or have semantic funtions. There is, however, no straightforward matching from 
particles to functions, as, e.g., ga can mark the subject, the object or an adjunct of a sentence. Particles 
can cooccur. Verbal arguments that could be identified by particles can be eliminated in the Japanese 
sentence. And finally, in spoken language particles are often omitted. A proper treatment of particles is 
thus necessary to make an analysis of Japanese sentences possible. Our treatment is based on an empirical investigation of 800 dialogues. We set up a type hierarchy of particles motivated by their subcategorizational and modificational behaviour. This type hierarchy is part of the Japanese syntax in VERBMOBIL.},

Pickling, a mechanism to make higher order values persistent, is provided on top of the Java Object Serialization. Finally, a high-level distributed programming model for DML is implemented based on Java's Remote Method Invocation architecture.

We will address both concurrent and constraint logic programming. As base language we will use a dynamically typed language that is obtained from SML by eliminating type declarations and static type checking. Our approach can be extended to cover all features of Oz. The experience with the development of Oz tells us that the outlined approach is the right base for the practical development of concurrent constraint programming languages. It avoids unnecessary duplication of concepts by reusing functional programming as core technology. Of course, it does not unify the partly incompatible theories behind functional and logic programming. They both contribute at a higher level of abstraction to the understanding of different aspects of the class of programming languages proposed here.},

   Abstract = {The context in which a word appears in natural language often influences its interpretation in such a way that the base meaning of the word is changed or made more specific. Polysemy and metonymy are examples for this phenomenon. These meaning shifts of words can be modeled by augmenting the semantic representation of a natural language utterance with the information that is missing to make the shift in meaning explicit. This information can be provided by linguistic or non-linguistic sources or an interaction of both. Recently, Egg (1999) has suggested an account of meaning shifts which exploits underspecification methods to yield a monotonic augmentation process. The main idea is to have semantic construction derive a sufficiently relaxed (i.e. made less specific) semantic representation, so that adding the missing information is simply further specification of this representation. This thesis will examine a treatment of meaning shifts due to systematic polysemy or metonymy within Egg's framework. We will present a syntax/semantics interface which derives appropriately relaxed semantic representations. To account for meaning shifts these representations can be augmented monotonically with additional information. We will point out a potential problem for this approach: making underspecified semantic representations less specific may cause overgeneration. However, as we will show, for our applications relaxation is safe, i.e. there is no danger of overgeneration. The underspecification formalism that we will use throughout this thesis is in the class of tree description languages subsuming dominance constraints. We will distinguish a novel class of subconstraints with a certain structure which powerfully support the type of inferences on dominance and disjointness which we have to make for proving safety of relaxation.},

   Abstract = {Presupposition triggers, such as e.g. 'the', 'too', 'another', impose constraints on the context they are used in. A violation of these constraints results in an infelicitous utterance. A natural language generation system therefore has to reason on the context to check that they are satisfied. We argue that this kind of contextual reasoning is essentially a model checking task and demonstrate this for a variety of presupposition triggers. To account for the influence of some background knowledge, we propose to embed queries to a description logic knowledge base in a first order model checking algorithm.},

Should different layers of annotation be kept separate, or should and can they be merged? How and at which granularity can we align/integrate multiple layers of annotation? If expressively more powerful data structures than trees/forests are required, then what kinds of mechanisms are needed to query such data structures?, we propose an XML-based approach to the representation and querying of multi-layer corpora.},

Based on a lexicon of morphs, the approach combines two-level morphology and a feature-based unification grammar describing word formation. To overcome the heavy use of diacritics, feature structures are associated with the two-level rules. These feature structures function as filters for the application of the rules. That way information contained in the lexicon and the morphological grammar can guide the application of the two-level rules. Moreover, information can be transmitted from the two-level part to the grammar part. This approach allows for a natural description of some nonconcatenative morphological phenomena as well as morphonological phenomena that are restricted to certain word classes in their applicability. The approach is applied to German inflectional and derivational morphology. The component may easily be incorporated into natural language understanding systems and can be especially useful in medical, scientific, or technical languages where it can be used for the automatic processing of compound words.},

   Abstract = {This paper deals with the effect of tempo on phonological structure. In two production experiments, German speakers were asked to read texts at three self-selected rates, "normal", "fast", and "slow". Different speaker strategies were inspected in terms of pausing, phrasing, pitch accent structure and segmental reductions. The first aim of the study is to describe the reorganisation of the pho-nological structure as a function of the three speech rate categories. The second goal is to discuss the strategies used in speaking faster and slower than normal, considering in particular the homogeneity among speakers and the symmetry within speakers. The differences found between and within speakers provide a basis for modelling individual tempo profiles at the phonological level, which could be exploited e.g. for the synthesis of individual voices and speaking styles.},

Against a common expectation the majority of labelled laughs are speech-laughs. The phonetic characteristics for this type of laughter is an additional aspiration (different for voiced and unvoiced sounds) which is sometimes accompanied by a vibrato voice quality and a duration of two syllables. In a perception test the hypothesis of an acoustic continuum from smile to laugh has been rejected. The results and the problems are discussed in the context of paralinguistic phonetics.},

With the exception of tempo, the auditory impressions were basically confirmed. The examination shows further that the results of the investigated prosodic parameters pause duration, pausing and breathing rate, F0 level and range, intensity, and spectral tilt fit well with other forms of excitement such as anger or elation. Additionally, it is discussed how the specific speaking style of horse race commentators can be classified. Finally, the role of prosodic descriptions for modelling those speaking styles and emotions, especially for speech technology, is considered.},

Energy manipulation was carried out using diphone synthesis as a basis for generating stimuli for perception tests in English and Danish. The results of the listening experiments, in which different versions of a paragraph were ranked for naturalness indicate that amplitude differences can contribute to greater naturalness. However, it is apparent that fine-tuning of amplitude requires good quality synthesis at the more basic prosodic levels.},

   Abstract = {The Grammatical analysis with linguistically designed grammars has always been a central topic of investigation in theoretical computational linguistics. However, deep grammatical analysis has played a negligible role in the development of language technology applications. Deep parsers have been lacking efficiently and robustness. Building up coverage has been slow and costly. The few linguistic grammars that truly exhibit large coverage have caused a constant fight with extensive ambiguity. In my talk I will present recent developments that provide new challenges and opportunities for linguistic methods. Increased efficiency of deep parsing and the embedding of a selective deep analysis into a robust shallow regime for information extraction offer ways to employ deep parsing in an environment where it can improve results without ruining robustness. I will argue that such a selective utilization as we have realized it by an integration of HPSG parsing into a hybrid IE system comprised of statistical and FST components, also provides a promising direction for gradual, measurable controlled progress in the development of deep grammars and lexicons.},

   Abstract = {Manual, large scale (computational) grammar development is time consuming, expensive and requires lots of linguistic expertise. More recently, a number of alternatives based on treebank resources (such as Penn-II, Susanne, AP treebank) have been explored. The idea is to automatically induce or rather read
off (P)CFG grammars from the parse annotated treebank resources and to use the treebank grammars thusobtained in (probabilistic) parsing or as a starting point for further grammar development. The approach is cheap, fast, automatic, large scale, data driven and based on real language resources. Treebankgrammars typically involve large sets of lexical tags and non-lexical categories as syntactic informationtends to be encoded in monadic category symbols. They feature flat rules (trees) that can underspecify attachment possibilities. Treebank grammars do not in general follow Xbar architectural design principles (this is not to say that treebank grammars do not have design principles). As a consequence, treebank grammars tend to have very large CFG rule bases (e.g. Penn-II > 17,000 CFG rules for about 1 million words of text) with often only minimally differing rules. Even though treebank grammars are large, they are still incomplete, exhibiting unabated rule accession rates. From a grammar engineering point of view, the size of the rule base poses problems for maintainability, extendability and, if a treebank grammar is to be used as a CF-base in a LFG grammar, for functional (feature-structure) annotations. From the point of view of theoretical linguistics, flat treebank trees and treebank grammars extracted from such trees do not express linguistic generalisations. From the perspective of empirical and corpus linguistics, flat trees are well-motivated as they allow underspecification of subtle and often time consuming attachment decisions. Indeed, it is sometimes doubted whether highly general Xbar schemata usefully scale to real language. In previous work we developed methodologies for automatic feature-structure annotation of grammars extracted from treebanks. Automatic annotation of raw treebank grammars is difficult as annotation rules often need to identify subsequences in the RHSs of flat treebank rules as they explicitly encode head, complement and modifier relations. Xbar-based CFG rules should substantially facilitate automatic feature-structure annotation of grammar rules. In the present paper we conduct a number of experiments to explore a space of possible grammars based on a small fragment of the AP treebank resource.
Starting with the original treebank fragment we automatically extract a CFG G. We then apply an automatic structure preserving grammar compaction step which generalises categories in the original treebank fragment and reduces the number of rules extracted, resulting in a generalised treebank fragment and in a compacted grammar Gc. The generalised fragment is then manually corrected to catch missed constituents (and the like) resulting in an automatically extracted, compacted and (effectively manually) corrected grammar Gc;m. Manual correction proceeds in the spirit of treebank grammars (we do not introduce Xbar analyses). We then explore how many of the manual correction steps on treebank trees can be achieved automatically. We develop, implement and test an automatic treebank grooming methodology which is applied to the generalised treebank fragment to yield a compacted and automatically corrected grammar Gc;a. Grammars Gc;m and Gc;a are very similar to compiled out flat LFG-82 style grammars. We explore regular expression based compaction (both manual and automatic) to relate Gc;m to a LFG-82 style grammar design. Finally, we manually recode a subsection of the generalised and manually corrected treebank fragment into vanilla-flavour Xbar based trees. From these we extract a compacted, manually corrected, Xbar-based grammar Gc;m;x. We evaluate our grammars and methods using standard labelled bracketing measures and according to how well they perform under automatic feature-structure annotation tasks.},

   Abstract = {In a natural language generation module, we often distinguish two components. On the one hand it needs
to be decided what should be said. This task is delegated to a planning component. Such a component
might produce an expression representing the content of the proposed utterance. On the basis of this
representation the syntactic generation component produces the actual output sentence(s). Although the
distinction between planning and syntactic generation is not uncontroversial, we will nonetheless
assume such an architecture here, in order to explain some of the issues that arise in syntactic
generation.
A (natural language) grammar is a formal device that defines a relation between (natural language)
utterances and their corresponding meanings. In practice this usually means that a grammar defines a
relation between strings and logical forms. During natural language understanding, the task is to arrive
at a logical form that corresponds to the input string. Syntactic generation can be described as the
problem to find the corresponding string for an input logical form.
We are thus making a distinction between the grammar which defines this relation, and the procedure
that computes the relation on the basis of such a grammar. In the current state of the art
unification-based (or more general: constraint-based) formalisms are used to express such grammars,
e.g., Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Bre82], Head-Driven Phrase-Structure Grammar (HPSG)
[PS87] and constraint-based categorial frameworks (cf. [Usz86] and [ZKC87]).
Almost all modern linguistic theories assume that a natural language grammar not only describes the
correct sentences of a language, but that such a grammar also describes the corresponding semantic
structures of the grammatical sentences. Given that a grammar specifies the relation between phonology
and semantics it seems obvious that the generator is supposed to use this specification. For example,
Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars (GPSG) [GKPS85] provide a detailed description of the
semantic interpretation of the sentences licensed by the grammar. Thus one might assume that a
generator based on GPSG constructs a sentence for a given semantic structure, according to the semantic
interpretation rules of GPSG. Alternatively, [Bus90] presents a generator, based on GPSG, which does
not take as its input a logical form, but rather some kind of control expression which merely instructs the
grammatical component which rules of the grammar to apply. Similarly, in the conception of [GP90], a
generator is provided with some kind of deep structure which can be interpreted as a control expression
instructing the grammar which rules to apply. These approaches to the generation problem clearly solve
some of the problems encountered in generation---simply by pushing the problem into the conceptual
component (i.e., the planning component). In this overview we restrict the attention to the more
ambitious approach sketched above.
The success of the currently developed constraint-based theories is due to the fact that they are purely
declarative. Hence, it is an interesting objective---theoretically and practically---to use one and the same
grammar for natural language understanding and generation. In fact the potential for reversibility was a
primary motivation for the introduction of Martin Kays Functional Unification Grammar (FUG). In
recent years interest in such a reversible architecture has led to a number of publications.},

   Abstract = {Some of the most difficult questions to answer when designing a distributed application are related to mobility: what information to transfer between sites and when and how to transfer it. Network-transparent distribution, the property that a program's behavior is independent of how it is partitioned among sites, does not directly address these questions. Therefore we propose to extend all language entities with a network behavior that enables efficient distributed programming by giving the programmer a simple and predictable control over network communication patterns. In particular, we show how to give objects an arbitrary mobility behavior that is independent of the object's definition. In this way, the syntax and semantics of objects are the same regardless of whether they are used as stationary servers, mobile agents, or simply as caches. These ideas have been implemented in Distributed Oz, a concurrent object-oriented language that is state aware and has data flow synchronization. We prove that the implementation of objects in Distributed Oz is network transparent. To satisfy the predictability condition, the implementation avoids forwarding chains through intermediate sites. The implementation is an extension to the publicly available DFKI Oz 2.0 system.},

Records can be naturally integrated into CCP as a new constraint domain. The implementation provides the added expressive power of concurrency and fine-grained constraints over records, yet does not pay for this expressivity when it is not used. In addition to traditional record operations, our implementation allows to compute with partially-known records. This fine granularity is useful for natural-language and knowledge-representation applications. The paper describes the implementation of records in the DFKI Oz system. Oz is a higher-order CCP language with encapsulated search. We show that the efficiency of records in CCP is competitive with modern Prolog implementation technology and that our implementation provides improved performance for natural-language applications.},

We use a parallel English-German corpus of medical abstracts and annotate it with linguistic information (tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatisation and decomposition, phrase recognition, grammatical functions) as well as semantic information from various sources. The annotation of medical terms/concepts, semantic types and semantic relations is based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Additionally, we use EuroWordNet as a general-language resource in annotating word senses and to compare domain-specific and general language use. A major aim of the project is also to complement existing ontological resources by extracting new terms and new semantic relations. We present the annotation scheme, which is conceptually related to stand-off annotation, and describe our tool for automatic semantic annotation.},

   Abstract = {This paper generalizes the notion of parsing as deduction to non-cumulative text production, in which changes can be made to already parsed material, for example, by a person using a grammar-checking text editor. The basic approach is to exploit the properties of a chart to determine which parts of the string need to be reanalysed in response to a change, thereby obtaining an incremental solution. An implementation of the proposed technique exists, which has been adapted to on-line processing under a simple text editor, thus providing a system which parses a text simultaneously as it is entered and edited.},

   Abstract = {It is discussed, how scheduling problems can be solved in the concurrent constraint programming language Oz. Oz is the first high-level constraint language, which offers an interface to invent new constraints in an efficient way using C++. Its multi-paradigm features including programmable search are unique in the field of constraint programming. Through the interface, algorithms from Operations Research and related fields can be incorporated. The algorithms can be combined through encapsulation into constraints and can communicate via shared variables. This is exemplified by the integration of new techniques based on edge-finding for job-shop and multi-capacitated scheduling. The viability of Oz as a platform for problem solving is also exemplified by a graphical scheduling workbench. The performance for job-shop problems is comparable to state-of-the-art scheduling tools.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes the Oz Scheduler, a workbench for scheduling problems. Through a graphical interface, the user can freely combine the elements that define a scheduling strategy. Such elements include constraints with different popagation behavior or distribution and search strategies. Exploring the possible combinations can lead to better solutions. Recent and successful techniques for scheduling are incorporated. Resulting from the selections made, a constraint problem is generated dynamically. For this problem, the solution, statistics and the search can be inspected by several graphical tools. The functionality can be extended by sending messages to the Scheduler. The functionality and the implementation of the Oz Scheduler are discussed. The overall performance of the Scheduler for standard benchmarks is comparable to state-of-the-art special-purpose systems for scheduling. The implementation is based on the concurrent constraint language Oz.},

   Abstract = {Finite Domain Programming is a technique for solving combinatorial problems like planning, scheduling, configuration or timetabling. Inevitably, these problems employ disjunctive constraints. A rather new approach to model those constraints is constructive disjunction, whereby common information is lifted from the alternatives, aiming for stronger pruning of the search space. We show where constructive disjunction provides for stronger pruning and where it fails to do so. For several problems, including a real-world college timetabling application, benefits and limitations of constructive disjunction are exemplified. As an experimental platform we use the concurrent constraint language Oz.},

   Abstract = {This thesis deals with the underspecified semantic representation and resolution of ellipsis. We focus on the interaction of Verb Phrase Ellipsis (henceforth VPE) and anaphora. In particular, we address the distribution of strict and sloppy readings in these phenomena and present an analysis to explain it. This analysis is integrated into a framework that concerns a uniform treatment of semantically underspecified information and parallelism phenomena in discourse. The analysis put forward in this thesis gives correct predictions about the strict and sloppy readings of a series of problematic cases in the literature. It does not suffer from undergeneration or overgeneration problems. We use linking relations between anaphoric pronouns and their antecedents and claim that the interaction between linking relations and the parallelism requirement in VPE results in strict and sloppy readings. The basic idea underlying the analysis presented in this thesis agrees with the proposal made by (Kehler 93; Kehler 95). Although recently a lot of approaches to semantic underspecification as well as ellipsis resolution have emerged in computational linguistics, few of them are designed to treat both problems uniformly. The framework proposed in this thesis shows how to integrate the treatment of ellipsis resolution with semantic underspecification in a uniform and elegant way.},

We deploy the TFIDF-based term classification method to acquire domain relevant single-word terms. Further, we apply two strategies in order to learn lexico-syntatic patterns which indicate paradigmatic and domain relevant syntagmatic relations between the extracted terms. The first one uses an existing ontology as initial knowledge for learning lexico-syntactic patterns, while the second is based on different collocation acquisition methods to deal with the free-word order languages like German. This domain-adaptive method yields good results even when trained on relatively small training corpora. It can be applied to different real-world applications, which need domain-relevant ontology, for example, information extraction, information retrieval or text classification.},

The challenge of the approach is to merge the technologies of crosslingual information retrieval (Jamie Carbonell et al, 1997) and natural language processing to achieve the following goals: · Provide full access to all information independent of the language the information was originally encoded in and independent of the query language; · Provide transparent natural language access to structured database information; · Provide hybrid and flexible query options to enable users to obtain maximally precise information.},

In this paper, we mainly present the information extraction techniques adopted in the model, including multilingual information extraction, concept based multilingual thesaurus, template automatic development, multilingual information retrieval and index etc. We build the model for providing the multilingual information retrieval means on Internet, which is accurate, quick and convenient and is used in a specific domain.

In perception experiments using German speech synthesis, two standard duration models (Klatt rules and CART) were tested. The input to these models consisted of a symbolic representation which was either derived from a database or a text-to-speech system. Results of the perception experiments show that different duration models can only be distinguished when the symbolic representation is appropriate. Considering the relative importance of the symbolic representation, post-lexical segmental rules were investigated with the outcome that listeners differ in their preferences regarding the degree of segmental reduction. As a conclusion, before fine-tuning the duration prediction, it is important to derive an appropriate phonological symbolic representation in order to improve timing in synthetic speech.},

dependencies.  First, we isolate a set of features useful for this task.  Second, we develop both a two-step approach which combines a trace tagger with a state-of-the-art
lexicalized parser and a one-step approach which finds
non-local dependencies while parsing. We find that the
former outperforms the latter because it makes better use of
the features we isolate.},

   Abstract = {Verbs like begin may take either a VP or an NP complement, but their meaning is pretty similar in both cases, e.g., for begin, the start of an eventuality is at stake. Pustejovsky's approach captures this similarity in terms of an invariant meaning of the verb, which entails a process or reinterpretation for the transitive variant of the verb. I will show that while the intuitions of this proposal are on the right track, its actual implementation suffers from a number of shortcomings. I will offer an analysis that preserves Pustejovsky's intuition but avoids these shortcomings. My analysis is based on an appropriate underspecifcation formalism.},

Lerner gehört vermutlich weltweit zu den besten Kennern der linguistischen Literatur zu diesem Forschungsbereich.Der eigentliche Kern der Arbeit ist jedoch Lerners eigene Theorie des Rekonstruktionsprozesses, die zunächst für die Ellipse entwickelt und dann auf Konstruktionen mit Sachverhaltsanaphern und Fokuspartikeln erweitert wird. Ihre deskriptive Abdeckung ist beeindruckend. Die Kollektion der behandelten Problemfälle, die sich aus der Interaktion von Parallelismus, Anaphern und Quantoren ergeben, ist wohl einzigartig.
