                 L-system are two powerful linear fractal models. The
                 main drawback of recurrent iterated function systems is
                 a difficulty in modeling whereas the main drawback of
                 L-systems is inefficient geometry specification.
                 Iterative and recursive structures extend the object
                 instancing paradigm, allowing it to model linear
                 fractals. Instancing models render faster and are more
                 intuitive to the computer graphics community. A
                 preliminary section briefly introduces the object
                 instancing paradigm and illustrates its ability to
                 model linear fractals. Two main sections summarize
                 recurrent iterated function systems and L-systems, and
                 provide methods with examples for converting such
                 models to the object instancing paradigm. Finally, a

                 The variables u and $p$ describe the velocity and the
                 pressure of a viscous incompressible flow in a bounded
                 region $\Omega \subset \mbox{R}^2$. We developed
                 simulation tools for these equations (see [6],[7]),
                 consisting of a preprocessing part (input of all data,
                 domain, coarse triangulation, boundary values), a fully
                 modular finite element solver and an appropriate
                 postprocessing. The most important components of the
                 finite element code, which is mainly based on the
                 package FEAT (see [1]), are the following ones: The
                 Fractional-step $\vartheta$-scheme, which is second
                 order accurate and strongly A-stable, is used for the
                 time discretization. The nonlinear problems (stationary
                 Navier-Stokes equations) are solved by a fixed point
                 defect correction method, with an upwind discretization
                 for the convective terms. Finally, the resulting
                 unsymmetric linear subproblems are treated by a
                 multigrid algorithm, which is adapted to the
                 nonconforming discretely divergence-free finite
                 elements. In extensive test calculations ([6]) we
                 showed that our method is a candidate for a {"}Black

                 Propulsion Laboratory from April 14 through April 16,
                 1992. System software and tools both include many
                 subjects and interactions among disciplines. To provide
                 a manageable structure for the workshop, seven topic
                 areas were identified and assigned to working groups
                 for study: Applications, Mathematical software,
                 Compilers and Languages, Software tools, Operating
                 systems, Computing environments, and Visualization.
                 These diverse topic areas also ensured that key
                 concepts and technologies would be addressed. The
                 Applications Working Group played a unique role by
                 identifying the requirements HPCC applications have for
                 the software addressed by the other working groups.\par
                 Over 120 experts from a wide spectrum of industrial,
                 academic, and government organizations contributed to
                 the workshop and its working groups. Each working group
                 prepared a position paper on its topic before the
                 workshop, discussed it with the other groups during the
                 workshop, and revised it based on the interactions. In
                 their position papers the working groups were asked to
                 address the following four issues: 1) Identify the
                 important system software problems that need to be
                 solved if the HPCC program is to be successful. 2)
                 Categorize the software problems as (a) those that are
                 best left to the vendors of HPC equipment, (b) those
                 that are primarily the responsibility of the users, (c)
                 those that could benefit from joint government agency
                 attention, and (d) those whose solution should involve
                 collaboration with the vendors. 3) Establish priorities
                 for the software problems. 4) Provide a vision for the
                 HPCC software component.\par This book includes the
                 working group position papers, summaries of those

                 raster ray tracing, that is practice insensitive to the
                 complexity of the scene or the object type, and in
                 therefore provides a substantial improvement in
                 computational speed over existing algorithms. In a
                 preprocessing voxelization phase, the geometric model
                 is converted into its discrete voxel-based
                 representation within a 3D raster of atomic voxels.
                 Next, a recursive ray tracing algorithm is engaged, in
                 which 3D discrete rays are traversed through the 3D
                 raster. Encountering a non transparent voxel by the ray
                 traversal algorithm indicates a ray-surface hit,
                 thereby eliminating the need for the computationally
                 expensive ray-object intersection calculations. We also

                 intersection verification. The 3D raster based approach
                 to ray tracing is especially attractive for rendering
                 complex geometric scenes and constructive solid models.

                 directly manipulating a surface in computer graphics.
                 The surface is considered as a collection of points in
                 three-dimensional space which define a surface. These
                 points may be the vertices of polygons, the control
                 points of splines, and so on. Three paradigms are
                 described and evaluated: direct grabbing of the surface
                 at a single point and moving a neighborhood of that
                 point; pushing on the surface with a tool; and pushing
                 on the surface with a model of the user's hand. These
                 paradigms are based on a spatially weighted
                 transformation. This transformation is based on a
                 'bump' weight function on the surface which is shaped

                 increasingly important aspect of computer science, with
                 uses ranging from flight simulation to medical imaging.
                 One result of this popularity is a need for
                 workstations that are capable of producing 3D imagery
                 in real time, or near real time. This means the ability
                 to generate images fast enough to give the impression
                 of movement. To achieve these speeds, it is necessary
                 that the algorithms that are implemented in hardware
                 should be as efficient as possible. On close
                 examination, it was found that traditional algorithms
                 often unnecessarily duplicate calculations, because no
                 account is taken of the fact that geometric items such
                 as edges and vertices are often duplicated or shared
                 between adjacent polygons in an image. A new algorithm
                 has been developed which takes account of such sharing,
                 and is thus able to achieve an order of magnitude
                 increase in performance over equivalent systems.
                 Although much effort has been put into increasing the
                 speed of the basic functions of real time graphics
                 workstations, less work has been associated with
                 improving the sophistication of image generation in
                 these systems. Two important techniques associated with
                 high-quality imagery, texture mapping and environment
                 mapping, have been examined and found suitable for
                 implementation in hardware. Accordingly, such hardware
                 (in varying levels of detail) has been designed.
                 Finally, an overall hardware scheme is presented for a
                 graphics workstation built around the edge-based
                 algorithm that has been developed, and incorporating

                 visual function. This is then followed by a progressive
                 development of the computer image processing, from
                 sub-pixel fragmentary edge determination to optical
                 flow field analysis, local and global stereo analysis,
                 colour imagery, edge-based region segmentation,
                 perceptual texture segmentation and high fidelity
                 contour form analysis. This treatment is considerably
                 different from other more publicised approaches, and is
                 highly recommended for those seeking a dynamic new
                 approach to computer vision.",
