  abstract = {Distribution is increasingly becoming an important issue in both enterprise applications and mobile computing. OSGi itself has only rudimental support for distribution, in forms of interfaces for interaction with Jini (R3) or UPnP (R3 + R4) infrastructures. When it comes to interconnecting different OSGi frameworks, there are only few solutions so far. In this paper, we present these existing solutions and compare the different approaches with our own R-OSGi. The goal of our open source project is to provide a seamless and noninvasive middleware for accessing remote services in OSGi frameworks. We explain the basic design principles of R-OSGi, such as transparent service access and spontaneous interaction, and briefly mention the internal structure and techniques used in R-OSGi, such as service discovery and smart proxies. 1.}

	Abstract = {There is a growing interest in leveraging Service Oriented
Architectures (SOA) in domains such as home automation,
automotive, mobile phones or e-Health. With the basic idea
(supported in e.g. OSGi) that components provide services, it
makes it possible to smoothly integrate the Internet of Things
(IoT) with the Internet of Services (IoS). The paradigm of
the IoS indeed offers interesting capabilities in terms of dynamicity
and interoperability. However in domains that involve
``things'' (e.g. appliances), there is still a strong need
for loose coupling and a proper separation between types
and instances that are well-known in Component-Based approaches
but that typical SOA fail to provide. This paper
presents how we can still get the best of both worlds by augmenting
SOA with a Component-Based approach. We illustrate
our approach with a case study from the domain of home
automation.},

ASM is based on a new approach, compared to equivalent existing tools, which consists in using the &amp;quot;visitor&amp;quot; design pattern without explicitly representing the visited tree with objects. This new approach gives much better performances than those of existing tools, for most of practical needs. RÉSUMÉ. ASM est un outil de manipulation de classes Java conçu pour la génération et la manipulation dynamiques de code, qui sont des techniques très utiles pour la réalisation de systèmes adaptables. ASM est basé sur une approche originale, par rapport aux outils existants équivalents, qui consiste à utiliser le patron de conception « visiteur » sans représenter explicitement l’arborescence visitée sous forme d’objets. Cette nouvelle approche permet d’obtenir des performances bien supérieures à celles des outils existants, pour la plupart des besoins courants.}

abstract={In this paper, we present RSP (remote service provider), which is a P2P-based effective service sharing scheme on distributed OSGi frameworks. RSP doesn't need to install additional software or have an additional transformation process of the service representation, because it uses only OSGi technology. In addition, RSP doesn't have any bottleneck problems, and it improves scalability by providing a service discovery mechanism using P2P. RSP can also access remote services transparently and it can guarantee reliability by sending an immediate notice about changes in the remote services.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a "modularization" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.}
