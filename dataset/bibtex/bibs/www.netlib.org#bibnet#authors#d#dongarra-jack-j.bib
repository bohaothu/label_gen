                 of the QR factorization on the Denelcor HEP. The
                 motivation for examining these implementations was to
                 investigate performance issues that we might expect to
                 face in developing mathematical software for linear
                 algebra problems on emerging parallel architectures.
                 The Denelcor HEP is particularly well suited for such a
                 study because it offers the possibility of very fine
                 grain parallelism through low overhead synchronization
                 primitives. We point out certain synchronization
                 problems that arise within the more lightly coupled
                 variations of the algorithm and offer a comparison of
                 the performance of these variations.",

                 QR-factorization of a matrix are presented. The
                 discussion is primarily concerned with implementation
                 of these algorithms on a computer that supports tightly
                 coupled parallel processes sharing a large common
                 memory. The three algorithms are a Householder method
                 based upon high-level modules, a Windowed Householder
                 method that avoids fork-join synchronization, and a
                 Pipelined Givens method that is a variant of the
                 data-flow type algorithms offering large enough
                 granularity to mask synchronization costs. Numerical
                 experiments were conducted on the Denelcor HEP
                 computer. The computational results indicate that the
                 Pipelined Givens method is preferred and that this is
                 primarily due to the number of array references
                 required by the various algorithms.",

                 the package has been to extend capabilities beyond loop
                 based parallelism and to provide a convenient machine
                 independent user interface. A package called SCHEDULE
                 is described which provides a standard user interface
                 to several shared memory parallel machines. A user
                 writes standard FORTRAN code and calls SCHEDULE
                 routines which express and enforce the large grain data
                 dependencies of his parallel algorithm. Machine
                 dependencies are internal to SCHEDULE and change from
                 one machine to another but the users code remains
                 essentially the same across all such machines. The
                 semantics and usage of SCHEDULE are described and
                 several examples of parallel algorithms which have been
                 implemented using SCHEDULE are presented.",

                 implementation. The LINPACK Benchmark provides three

                 computer performance on a dense system of linear
                 equations: the first for 100*100 matrix, the second for
                 a 300*300 matrix, and the third for a 1000*1000 matrix.

                 linear algebra modules is reviewed. We also present a

                 developing and analyzing explicitly parallel programs
                 in FORTRAN which are portable. This package now

                 either bidiagonal or Hessenberg form by using
                 Householder transformations. The approach is to

                 least-squares problems, but extends their functionality
                 in a number of ways. The major methodology for making
                 the algorithms run faster is to restructure them to
                 perform block matrix operations (e.g., matrix-matrix
                 multiplication) in their inner loops. These block
                 operations may be optimized to exploit the memory
                 hierarchy of a specific architecture. The LAPACK
                 project is also working on new algorithms that yield

                 system of linear equations. Over the years other data

                 the Benchmark has also expanded. The author attempts to
                 clear up some of the confusion and mystery surrounding
                 the LINPACK Benchmark. He examines what is measured and

                 multiplications and the solution of triangular systems
                 with multiple right-hand sides. They are intended to
                 provide efficient and portable building blocks for
                 linear algebra algorithms on high-performance
                 computers. We describe algorithms for the BLAS3
                 operations that are asymptotically faster than the
                 conventional ones. These algorithms are based on
                 Strassen's method for fast matrix multiplication, which
                 is now recognized to be a practically useful technique
                 once matrix dimensions exceed about 100. We pay
                 particular attention to the numerical stability of
                 these ``fast BLAS3.'' Error bounds are given and their
                 significance is explained and illustrated with the aid
                 of numerical experiments. Our conclusion is that the
                 fast BLAS3, although not as strongly stable as
                 conventional implementations, are stable enough to
                 merit careful consideration in many applications.",

  abstract =     "HeNCE (Heterogeneous Network Computing Environment) is
                 a parallel programming paradigm and tool which supports
                 the creation, compilation, execution, debugging, and
                 analysis of parallel programs for a heterogeneous group
                 of computers. The HeNCE programmer specifies the
                 parallelism of a computation by drawing a graph
                 describing the dependencies between user defined
                 procedures. HeNCE will then automatically execute these
                 procedures on a user defined collection of machines on
                 some network. Different versions of a procedure may
                 exist for different architectures. HeNCE executes the
                 appropriate version of a procedure for a chosen target
                 machine architecture. HeNCE maps procedures to machines
                 based on a user defined cost matrix. The HeNCE user
                 dynamically configures a parallel collection of
                 machines, referred to as a parallel virtual machine, on
                 which the HeNCE program is to be run.",

  abstract =     "Several multiprocessor systems are now commercially
                 available, and advances in compiler technology provide
                 automatic conversion of programs to run on such
                 systems. However, no accepted measure of this parallel
                 compiler ability exists. This paper presents a test
                 suite of subroutines and loops, called parallel loops,
                 designed to (1) measure the ability of parallelizing
                 compilers to convert code to run in parallel and (2)
                 determine how effectively parallel hardware and
                 software work together to achieve high performance
                 across a range of problem sizes. In addition, they
                 present the results of compiling this suite using two
                 commercially available parallelizing Fortran compilers,
                 Cray and Convex.",

                 development of parallel algorithms that are portable
                 across a range of high-performance computers. The first
                 tool, Schedule, aids in implementing and analysing
                 programs within a large-grain control flow model of
                 computation. The underlying concept is based on a
                 natural graphical interpretation of parallel
                 computation that is useful in designing and
                 implementing parallel algorithms. This graphical
                 interpretation may be used to automate the generation
                 of a parallel program through a facility called Build.
                 Schedule also provides a means for postprocessing
                 performance analysis through an animated visualization
                 of the flow of a parallel program's execution. This
                 animation is accomplished through the Trace facility.
                 The second tool, MAP, provides a graphical display of
                 memory access patterns in algorithms. Such patterns can
                 be important in understanding memory bottlenecks in

                 classes of parallel machines, especially these with
                 distributed memory. Although there are many variations,
                 the basic concept of processes communicating through
                 messages is well understood. Over the last ten years,
                 substantial progress has been made in casting
                 significant applications in this paradigm. Each vendor
                 has implemented its own variant. More recently, several
                 systems have demonstrated that a message-passing system
                 can be efficiently and portably implemented. A
                 definition of both the syntax and semantics of a core
                 of library routines is thus presented. It will be
                 useful to a wide range of users and efficiently
                 implementable on a wide range of computers.",

  abstract =     "Network computing seeks to utilize the aggregate
                 resources of many networked computers to solve a single
                 problem. In so doing it is often possible to obtain
                 supercomputer performance from an inexpensive local
                 area network. The drawback is that network computing is
                 complicated and error prone when done by hand,
                 especially if the computers have different operating
                 systems and data formats and are thus heterogeneous.
                 The heterogeneous network computing environment (HeNCE)
                 is an integrated graphical environment for creating and
                 running parallel programs over a heterogeneous
                 collection of computers. It is built on a lower level
                 package called parallel virtual machine (PVM). The
                 HeNCE philosophy of parallel programming is to have the
                 programmer graphically specify the parallelism of a
                 computation and to automate, as much as possible, the
                 tasks of writing, compiling, executing, debugging, and
                 tracing the network computation. Key to HeNCE is a
                 graphical language based on directed graphs that
                 describe the parallelism and data dependencies of an
                 application. Nodes in the graphs represent conventional
                 Fortran or C subroutines and the arcs represent data
                 and control flow. This article describes the present
                 state of HeNCE, its capabilities, limitations, and
                 areas of future research.",

                 for high-performance computers. These approaches are
                 exemplified by the LAPACK, templates, and ARPACK
                 projects. LAPACK is a software library for performing
                 dense and banded linear algebra computations, and was
                 designed to run efficiently on high-performance
                 computers. We focus on the design of the
                 distributed-memory version of LAPACK, and on an
                 object-oriented interface to LAPACK.",

  abstract =     "This paper presents new features of PVM, a popular
                 standard for writing parallel programs that execute
                 over networks of heterogeneous machines. Although PVM
                 has become an important infrastructure for parallel
                 programmers, we continue to develop the system based
                 both on user feedback and our own research interests.
                 In this paper we present new communications routines
                 and briefly characterize their performance. We describe
                 new extensible services that allow advanced users to
                 customize certain aspects of the default PVM
                 functionality. An overview of shared-memory PVM
                 optimizations is presented. PVM's new tracing facility
                 and a graphical console that utilizes this capability
                 are described. Finally, we discuss future extensions to
                 PVM now under investigation.",

                 reduction to block upper-Hessenberg form which can be
                 used to solve the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem on
                 message-passing multicomputers. On such multicomputers,
                 a nonsymmetric matrix can be distributed across
                 processing nodes logically configured into a
                 two-dimensional mesh using the block-cyclic data
                 distribution. Based on the matrix partitioning and
                 mapping, the algorithm employs both Householder
                 reflectors and Givens rotations within each reduction
                 step. We analyze the arithmetic and communication
                 complexities and describe the implementation details of
                 the algorithm on message-passing multicomputers. We
                 discuss two different implementations --- synchronous
                 and asynchronous --- and present performance results on
                 the Intel iPSC\slash 860 and DELTA. We conclude with an
                 evaluation of the algorithm's communication cost, and
                 suggest areas for further improvement.",

                 Internet-accessible resource that promotes software and
                 information exchange among those involved with
                 high-performance computing and communications. Now in
                 its infancy, the NHSE will link varied
                 discipline-oriented repositories of software and
                 documents, and encourage Grand Challenge teams and
                 other members of the HPCC community to contribute to
                 these repositories and use them. By acting as a
                 national on-line library of software that makes widely
                 distributed materials available through one place, the
                 exchange will cut down the amount of time, talent, and
                 money spent reinventing the wheel. Target audiences
                 include scientists and engineers in diverse HPCC
                 applications fields, computer scientists, users of
                 government and academic supercomputer centers, and

  abstract =     "Several parallel matrix transpose algorithms on
                 distributed memory concurrent processors are described.
                 It is assumed that the matrix is distributed over a P
                 \$MUL Q processor template with a block cyclic data
                 distribution. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of P
                 and Q determine the communication schemes of the
                 algorithms. Since the algorithms make use of
                 non-blocking, point-to-point communication between
                 processors, a process can overlap the messages that it
                 sends to different processors, thereby avoiding
                 unnecessary synchronization. By combining the
                 algorithms with the matrix multiplication routine, they
                 can be used to compute parallel multiplications of
                 transported matrices in the PUMMA package. Finally,
                 details of the parallel implementation of the
                 algorithms are given, and the results are presented for
                 runs on the Intel Touchstone Delta computer.",

  abstract =     "This paper discusses the design of linear algebra
                 libraries for high performance computers. Particular
                 emphasis is placed on the development of scalable
                 algorithms for multiple instruction multiple data
                 (MIMD) distributed memory concurrent computers. A brief
                 description of the EISPACK, LINPACK, and LAPACK
                 libraries is given, followed by an outline of
                 ScaLAPACK, which is a distributed memory version of
                 LAPACK currently under development. The importance of
                 block-partitioned algorithms in reducing the frequency
                 of data movement between different levels of
                 hierarchical memory is stressed. The use of such
                 algorithms helps reduce the message startup costs on
                 distributed memory concurrent computers. Other key
                 ideas in our approach are the use of distributed
                 versions of the Level 2 and Level 3 basic linear
                 algebra subprograms (BLAS) as computational building
                 blocks, and the use of basic linear algebra
                 communication subprograms (BLACS) as communication
                 building blocks. Together the distributed BLAS and the
                 BLACS can be used to construct higher-level algorithms,
                 and hide many details of the parallelism from the
                 application developer. The block-cyclic data
                 distribution is described and adopted as a good way of
                 distributing block-partitioned matrices.
                 Block-partitioned versions of the Cholesky and LU
                 factorizations are presented, and optimization issues
                 associated with the implementation of the LU
                 factorization algorithm on distributed memory
                 concurrent computers are discussed, together with its
                 performance on the Intel Delta system. Finally,
                 approaches to the design of library interfaces are
                 reviewed.",

                 check-pointing for distributed scientific computations.
                 With the widespread use of the `Network Of Workstation'
                 (NOW) platform for distributed computing, long-running
                 scientific computations need to tolerate the changing
                 and often faulty nature of NOW environments. We present
                 high-performance implementations of several algorithms
                 for distributed scientific computing, including
                 Cholesky factorization, LU factorization, QR
                 factorization, and Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient.
                 These implementations are able to run on PVM networks
                 of at least N processors, and can complete with low
                 overhead as long as any N processors remain functional.
                 We discuss the details of how the algorithms are tuned
                 for fault-tolerance, and present the performance
                 results on a PVM network of SUN workstations, and on
                 the IBM SP2.",

                 library development cannot wait, however, until all the
                 enabling technologies are in place for two reasons: The
                 need for such libraries for existing and near-term
                 parallel architectures is immediate, and progress in
                 all the supporting technologies depends on feedback
                 from concurrent efforts in library development. Four
                 major research issues that need to be addressed in
                 developing parallel scalable linear-algebra libraries
                 are identified; inadequate user-library interface,
                 necessity of object-oriented programming for developing
                 portable libraries, the importance of work on
                 algorithms, and the lack of language standards.",

                 library software for heterogeneous computing
                 environments. Although a lot of software for
                 distributed-memory parallel computers has been written,
                 porting this software to a network of workstations
                 requires careful consideration. The symptoms of
                 heterogeneous computing failures can range from
                 erroneous results without warning to deadlock. Some of
                 the problems are straightforward to solve, but for
                 others the solutions are not so obvious, or incur an
                 unacceptable overhead. Making software robust on
                 heterogeneous systems often requires additional
                 communication. We describe and illustrate the problems
                 encountered during the development of ScaLAPACK and the
                 NAG Numerical PVM Library. Where possible, we suggest
                 ways to avoid potential pitfalls, or if that is not
                 possible, we recommend that the software not be used on
                 heterogeneous networks.",

  abstract =     "This paper expands the specification of a set of
                 kernel routines for linear algebra, historically called
                 the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms and commonly known
                 as the BLAS.\par

                 Numerical linear algebra, particularly the solution of
                 linear systems of equations, linear least squares
                 problems, eigenvalue problems and singular value
                 problems, is fundamental to most calculations in
                 scientific computing, and is often the computationally
                 intense part of such calculations. Designers of
                 computer programs involving linear algebraic operations
                 have frequently chosen to implement certain low level
                 operations, such as the dot product or the matrix
                 vector product, as separate subprograms. This may be
                 observed both in many published codes and in codes
                 written for specific applications at many computer
                 installations.\par

                 A major aim of the standards defined in this paper is
                 to enable linear algebra libraries (both public domain
                 and commercial) to interoperate efficiently, reliably
                 and easily.",

  abstract =     "The efficient application of scientific computing
                 techniques requires specialized knowledge of numerical
                 methods and their implementation in mathematical
                 software libraries that many students, scientists and
                 engineers, working beyond the already strenuous demands
                 of their particular field, must struggle to achieve.
                 Active Netlib addresses this problem by creating an
                 active collection of executable mathematical software
                 deployed on computational servers and accessible over
                 the network from familiar desktop client interfaces.
                 The Netlib mathematical software collection is being
                 extended in a number of ways to support this project.
                 The NetSolve client-server system provides an active
                 interface to the contents of Netlib by constructing
                 network-accessible objects with executable content from
                 the software packages in Netlib. The NetSolve adaptive
                 solver interface guides the user in selecting
                 appropriate software, in setting parameters correctly,
                 and in interpreting numerical results. In addition,
                 Active Netlib provides mechanisms that enable resource
                 users to become resource providers by dynamically
                 uploading and deploying their own software
                 applications, which are reviewed before becoming part
                 of the moderated publicly available collection. It is
                 hoped that Active Netlib will grow to be a worldwide
                 collection of executable mathematical software, as well
                 as scientific and engineering applications, that is
                 both drawn upon and contributed to by researchers,
                 educators and students.",

                 management of the parallel environment, and
                 processor-specific tuning of kernels. Additionally, at
                 any of these levels we can decide to rearrange the
                 user's data. In this paper we look at a number of

                 have to be developed in order to take advantage of the

                 grain parallelism becomes a major requirement and
                 introduces the necessity of loose synchronization in
                 the parallel execution of an operation. This paper
                 presents an algorithm for the Cholesky, LU and QR
                 factorization where the operations can be represented
                 as a sequence of small tasks that operate on square

  abstract =     "As multicore systems continue to gain ground in the
                 High Performance Computing world, linear algebra
                 algorithms have to be reformulated or new algorithms
                 have to be developed in order to take advantage of the
                 architectural features on these new processors. Fine
                 grain parallelism becomes a major requirement and
                 introduces the necessity of loose synchronization in
                 the parallel execution of an operation. This paper
                 presents an algorithm for the QR factorization where
                 the operations can be represented as a sequence of
                 small tasks that operate on square blocks of data.
                 These tasks can be dynamically scheduled for execution
                 based on the dependencies among them and on the
                 availability of computational resources. This may
                 result in an out of order execution of the tasks which
                 will completely hide the presence of intrinsically
                 sequential tasks in the factorization. Performance
                 comparisons are presented with the LAPACK algorithm for
                 QR factorization where parallelism can only be
                 exploited at the level of the BLAS operations.",

  abstract =     "The STI CELL processor introduces pioneering solutions
                 in processor architecture. At the same time it presents
                 new challenges for the development of numerical
                 algorithms. One is effective exploitation of the
                 differential between the speed of single and double
                 precision arithmetic; the other is efficient
                 parallelization between the short vector SIMD cores. In
                 this work, the first challenge is addressed by
                 utilizing a mixed-precision algorithm for the solution
                 of a dense symmetric positive definite system of linear
                 equations, which delivers double precision accuracy,
                 while performing the bulk of the work in single
                 precision. The second challenge is approached by
                 introducing much finer granularity of parallelization
                 than has been used for other architectures and using a
                 lightweight decentralized synchronization. The
                 implementation of the computationally intensive
                 sections gets within 90 percent of peak floating point
                 performance, while the implementation of the memory
                 intensive sections reaches within 90 percent of peak
                 memory bandwidth. On a single CELL processor, the
                 algorithm achieves over 170 Gflop/s when solving a
                 symmetric positive definite system of linear equation
                 in single precision and over 150 Gflop/s when
                 delivering the result in double precision accuracy.",

                 Performance Computing system. Our approach is based on
                 a careful adaptation of the Algorithmic Based Fault
                 Tolerance technique (Huang and Abraham, 1984) to the
                 need of parallel distributed computation. We obtain a
                 strongly scalable mechanism for fault tolerance. We can
                 also detect and correct errors (bit-flip) on the fly of
                 a computation. To assess the viability of our approach,
                 we have developed a fault tolerant matrix-matrix
                 multiplication subroutine and we propose some models to
                 predict its running time. Our parallel fault-tolerant
                 matrix-matrix multiplication scores 1.4 TFLOPS on 484
                 processors (cluster {\tt jacquard.nersc.gov}) and
                 returns a correct result while one process failure has
                 happened. This represents 65\% of the machine peak

                 symmetric, and Hermitian matrices called RFPF
                 (Rectangular Full Packed Format). The standard two
                 dimensional arrays of Fortran and C (also known as full
                 format) that are used to represent triangular and
                 symmetric matrices waste nearly half of the storage
                 space but provide high performance via the use of Level
                 3 BLAS. Standard packed format arrays fully utilize
                 storage (array space) but provide low performance as
                 there is no Level 3 packed BLAS. We combine the good
                 features of packed and full storage using RFPF to
                 obtain high performance via using Level 3 BLAS as RFPF
                 is a standard full format representation. Also, RFPF
                 requires exactly the same minimal storage as packed
                 format. Each LAPACK full and/or packed triangular,
                 symmetric, and Hermitian routine becomes a single new
                 RFPF routine based on eight possible data layouts of
                 RFPF. This new RFPF routine usually consists of two
                 calls to the corresponding LAPACK full format routine
                 and two calls to Level 3 BLAS routines. This means no
                 new software is required. As examples, we present
                 LAPACK routines for Cholesky factorization, Cholesky
                 solution and Cholesky inverse computation in RFPF to
                 illustrate this new work and to describe its
                 performance on several commonly used computer
                 platforms. Performance of LAPACK full routines using
                 RFPF versus LAPACK full routines using standard format
                 for both serial and SMP parallel processing is about
                 the same while using half the storage. Performance
                 gains are roughly one to a factor of 43 for serial and
                 one to a factor of 97 for SMP parallel times faster
                 using vendor LAPACK full routines with RFPF than with

                 algorithms-by-tiles. In particular, the Block
                 Hessenberg Reduction is very often used as a
                 pre-processing step in solving dense linear algebra
                 problems, such as the standard eigenvalue problem.
                 Although expensive, orthogonal transformations are
                 commonly used for this reduction because they guarantee
                 stability, as opposed to Gaussian Elimi- nation. Two
                 versions of the Block Hessenberg Reduction are
                 presented in this paper, the first one with Householder
                 reflectors and the second one with Givens rotations. A
                 short investigation on variants of Fast Givens
                 Rotations is also mentioned. Furthermore, in the last
                 Top500 list from June 2008, 98\% of the fastest
                 parallel systems in the world are based on multicores.
                 The emerging petascale systems consisting of hundreds
                 of thousands of cores have exacerbated the problem even
                 more and it becomes judicious to efficiently integrate
                 existing or new numerical linear algebra algorithms
                 suitable for such hardwares. By exploiting the concepts
                 of algorithms-by-tiles in the multicore environment
                 (i.e., high level of parallelism with fine granularity
                 and high performance data representation combined with
                 a dynamic data driven execution), the Block Hessenberg
                 Reduction presented here achieves 72\% of the DGEMM
                 peak on a 12000 \times 12000 matrix with 16 Intel
                 Tigerton 2.4 GHz processors.",

  abstract =     "If multicore is a disruptive technology, try to
                 imagine hybrid multicore systems enhanced with
                 accelerators! This is happening today as accelerators,
                 in particular Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), are
                 steadily making their way into the high performance
                 computing (HPC) world. We highlight the trends leading
                 to the idea of hybrid manycore/GPU systems, and we
                 present a set of techniques that can be used to
                 efficiently program them. The presentation is in the
                 context of Dense Linear Algebra (DLA), a major building
                 block for many scientific computing applications. We
                 motivate the need for new algorithms that would split
                 the computation in a way that would fully exploit the
                 power that each of the hybrid components offers. As the
                 area of hybrid multicore/GPU computing is still in its
                 infancy, we also argue for its importance in view of
                 what future architectures may look like. We therefore
                 envision the need for a DLA library similar to LAPACK
                 but for hybrid manycore/GPU systems. We illustrate the
                 main ideas with an LU-factorization algorithm where
                 particular techniques are used to reduce the amount of
                 pivoting, resulting in an algorithm achieving up to 388
                 GFlop/s for single and up to 99.4 GFlop/s for double
                 precision factorization on a hybrid Intel Xeon (2x4
                 cores @ 2.33 GHz) --- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 5 (240

                 algebra using the 8-series NVIDIA GPUs. Our
                 matrix-matrix multiply routine (GEMM) runs 60\% faster
                 than the vendor implementation in CUBLAS 1.1 and
                 approaches the peak of hardware capabilities. Our LU,
                 QR and Cholesky factorizations achieve up to 80--90\%
                 of the peak GEMM rate. Our parallel LU running on two
                 GPUs achieves up to $\approx$300 Gflop/s. These results
                 are accomplished by challenging the accepted view of
                 the GPU architecture and

                 programming guidelines. We argue that modern GPUs
                 should be viewed as multithreaded multicore vector
                 units. We exploit blocking similarly to vector
                 computers and heterogeneity of the system by computing
                 both on GPU and CPU. This study includes detailed
                 benchmarking of the GPU memory system that reveals
                 sizes and latencies of caches and TLB. We present a
                 couple of algorithmic optimizations aimed at increasing
                 parallelism and regularity in the problem that provide

                 implementations for the two-sided linear algebra
                 transformations, in particular the Hessenberg and
                 Bidiagonal reductions which are the first steps for the
                 standard eigenvalue problems and the singular value
                 decompositions respectively. State-of-the-art dense
                 linear algebra softwares, such as the LAPACK and
                 ScaLAPACK libraries, suffer performance losses on
                 multicore processors due to their inability to fully
                 exploit thread-level parallelism. At the same time the
                 coarse-grain dataflow model gains popularity as a
                 paradigm for programming multicore architectures. By
                 using the concepts of algorithms-by-tiles [Buttari et
                 al., 2007] along with efficient mechanisms for
                 data-driven execution, these two-sided reductions
                 achieve high performance computing. The main drawback
                 of the algorithms-by-tiles approach for two-sided
                 transformations is that the full reduction can not be
                 obtained in one stage. Other methods have to be
                 considered to further reduce the band matrices to the
                 required forms.",

  abstract =     "The development of high performance dense linear
                 algebra (DLA) critically depends on highly optimized
                 BLAS, and especially on the matrix multiplication
                 routine (GEMM). This is especially true for Graphics
                 Processing Units (GPUs), as evidenced by recently
                 published results on DLA for GPUs that rely on highly
                 optimized GEMM [13, 11]. However, the current best GEMM
                 performance, e.g. of up to 375 GFlop/s in single
                 precision and of up to 75 GFlop/s in double precision
                 arithmetic on NVIDIA's GTX 280, is difficult to
                 achieve. The development involves extensive GPU
                 knowledge and even backward engineering to understand
                 some undocumented insides about the architecture that
                 have been of key importance in the development [12]. In
                 this paper, we describe some GPU GEMM auto-tuning
                 optimization techniques that allow us to keep up with
                 changing hardware by rapidly reusing, rather than
                 reinventing, the existing ideas. Auto-tuning, as we
                 show in this paper, is a very practical solution where
                 in addition to getting an easy portability, we can
                 often get substantial speedups even on current GPUs
                 (e.g. up to 27\% in certain cases for both single and
                 double precision GEMMs on the GTX 280).",

  abstract =     "We describe a new data format for storing triangular,
                 symmetric, and Hermitian matrices called {\em
                 Rectangular Full Packed Format\/} (RFPF). The standard
                 two-dimensional arrays of Fortran and C (also known as
                 {\em full format\/}) that are used to represent
                 triangular and symmetric matrices waste nearly half of
                 the storage space but provide high performance via the
                 use of Level 3 BLAS. Standard packed format arrays
                 fully utilize storage (array space) but provide low
                 performance as there is no Level 3 packed BLAS. We
                 combine the good features of packed and full storage
                 using RFPF to obtain high performance via using Level 3
                 BLAS as RFPF is a standard full-format representation.
                 Also, RFPF requires exactly the same minimal storage as
                 the packed format. Each LAPACK full and/or packed
                 triangular, symmetric, and Hermitian routine becomes a
                 single new RFPF routine based on eight possible data
                 layouts of RFPF. This new RFPF routine usually consists
                 of two calls to the corresponding LAPACK full-format
                 routine and two calls to Level 3 BLAS routines. This
                 means {\em no\/} new software is required. As examples,
                 we present LAPACK routines for Cholesky factorization,
                 Cholesky solution, and Cholesky inverse computation in
                 RFPF to illustrate this new work and to describe its
                 performance on several commonly used computer
                 platforms. Performance of LAPACK full routines using
                 RFPF versus LAPACK full routines using the standard
                 format for both serial and SMP parallel processing is
                 about the same while using half the storage.
                 Performance gains are roughly one to a factor of 43 for
                 serial and one to a factor of 97 for SMP parallel times
                 faster using vendor LAPACK full routines with RFPF than
                 with using vendor and/or reference packed routines.",

  abstract =     "John Francis's implicitly shifted QR algorithm turned
                 the problem of matrix eigenvalue computation from
                 difficult to routine almost overnight about fifty years
                 ago. It was named one of the top ten algorithms of the
                 twentieth century by Dongarra and Sullivan, and it
                 deserves to be more widely known and understood by the
                 general mathematical community. This article provides
                 an efficient introduction to Francis's algorithm that
                 follows a novel path. Efficiency is gained by omitting
                 the traditional but wholly unnecessary detour through
                 the basic QR algorithm. A brief history of the
                 algorithm is also included. It was not a one-man show;
                 some other important names are Rutishauser, Wilkinson,
                 and Kublanovskaya. Francis was never a specialist in
                 matrix computations. He was employed in the early
                 computer industry, spent some time on the problem of
                 eigenvalue computation and did amazing work, and then
                 moved on to other things. He never looked back, and he
                 remained unaware of the huge impact of his work until
                 many years later.",
