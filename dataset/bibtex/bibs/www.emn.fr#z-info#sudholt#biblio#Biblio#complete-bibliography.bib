   ABSTRACT     = {Behavioral specifications which are integrated into 
      component interfaces are an important means for the correct 
      construction of component-based systems. Currently, such 
      specifications are typically limited to finite-state protocols 
      because more expressive notions of protocol do not support reasonable 
      basic composition properties, such as compatibility and 
      substitutability. In this paper, we present first results of the 
      integration into component interfaces of a notion of non-regular 
      protocols based on {``}non-regular process types{''} introduced by 
      Puntigam. More concretely, we present three contributions: (i) a 
      motivation of the usefulness of non-regular protocols in the context 
      of peer-to-peer applications, (ii) a language for non-regular 
      protocols and an outline of a suitable formal definition, (iii) a 
      discussion of basic composition properties and an analysis of how to 
      adequately integrate protocol-modifying operators in the model. }

   ABSTRACT     = {Automating software evolution requires both identifying 
      precisely the affected program points and selecting the appropriate 
      modification at each point. This task is particularly complicated 
      when considering large pieces of software, even when the 
      modifications appear to be systematic. We illustrate this situation 
      in the context of evolving the Linux kernel to support Bossa, an 
      event-based framework for process-scheduler development. To support 
      Bossa, events must be added at points scattered throughout the 
      kernel. In each case, the choice of event depends on properties of 
      one or a sequence of instructions. To describe precisely the choice 
      of event, we propose to guide the event insertion by using a set of 
      rules, amounting to an aspect, that describes the control-flow 
      contexts in which each event should be generated. In this paper, we 
      present our approach and describe the set of rules that allow proper 
      event insertion. These rules use temporal logic to describe sequences 
      of instructions that require events to be inserted. We also give an 
      overview of an implementation that we have developed to automatically 
      perform this evolution.}

   ABSTRACT     = {There is a continuous demand for new scheduling policies 
      to address specific requirements of modern OSes. However, the 
      implementation of such policies within an existing OS kernel raises 
      many problems, mainly because optimizations within schedulers hinder 
      code maintenance and implementation of existing schedulers is spread 
      over the kernel. In this paper we motivate that schedulers form an 
      aspect within OS kernels. We show how the DSL of the Bossa system for 
      the definition of scheduling policies and its runtime support can be 
      integrated with a framework for Aspect-Oriented Programming, 
      Event-based AOP. Finally, we discuss the generalization of AOP-based 
      techniques to other OS kernel modules.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Component-based programming promises to facilitate the 
      construction of large-scale applications, which is supported by the 
      important concept of interfaces. In most current component models, 
      interfaces essentially declare types and sets of services that a 
      component implements. They are not expressive enough to formulate 
      many properties important for component collaboration. In this paper 
      we consider an important class of such properties, sequencing 
      constraints, which components must obey when calling one another 
      services. We consider the integration into interfaces of sequencing 
      properties by means of protocols formalized in terms of finite-state 
      machines. The paper presents three contributions. First, a set of 
      protocol composition operators and a discussion of correctness 
      properties of such operators useful for component assembly. Second, 
      we provide a first step toward the integration of additional state 
      information into protocols. Finally, we show how JavaBeans can 
      benefit from the techniques we present. }

   ABSTRACT     = {Computational reflection is gaining interest in 
      practical applications as witnessed by the use of reflection in the 
      Java programming environment and recent work on reflective 
      middleware. Reflective systems offer many different reflection 
      programming interfaces, the so-called Meta-Object Protocols (MOPs). 
      Their design is subject to a number of constraints relating to, among 
      others, expressive power, efficiency and security properties. Since 
      these constraints are different from one application to another, we 
      should be able to easily provide specially-tailored MOPs. In this 
      paper, we present a generic reification technique based on program 
      transformation. It enables the selective reification of arbitrary 
      parts of object-oriented metacircular interpreters. The program 
      transformation can be applied to different interpreter definitions. 
      Each resulting reflective implementation provides a different MOP 
      directly derived from the original interpreter definition.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Since Smith seminal work, there have been numerous 
      reflective language definition and implementation proposals. These 
      proposals, initially restricted to functional languages, have been 
      quickly extended to object-oriented languages. Unfortunately, 
      reflective object-oriented language definitions remained mostly ad 
      hoc. In this paper, we present a generic reification technique which 
      enables the selective reification of arbitrary parts of 
      object-oriented language interpreters. Our program transformation can 
      be applied to different interpreter definitions. Each resulting 
      reflective implementation provides a different meta-object protocol 
      based on the original interpreter definition. This technique paves 
      the way to a systematic study of reflective object-oriented language 
      implementations.}

   ABSTRACT     = {In this paper we develop in three phases a railway 
      control system. We are mainly concerned with the \emph{software 
      architecture} of the control system and its \emph{dynamic evolution}; 
      we do not discuss here the implementation details of the components 
      forming the control system. First, we informally discuss our design 
      proposal for the architecture of the control system: a hierarchy of 
      controllers whose leaves are local controllers connected in a network 
      that mimics the underlying railway topology. Second, we formally 
      define by means of particular \emph{graph grammars} a style of 
      software architectures for the railway control system consisting of 
      two complementary \emph{views} and ensuring several desirable 
      properties by construction. The dynamic evolution of the architecture 
      is modelled by a set of \emph{coordination rules} which define graph 
      transformations and are \emph{verified} w.r.t. to the graph grammar. 
      Third, using a coordination rule as a formal specification of a 
      dynamic modification of the railway control system, we derive its 
      implementation in ConCoord, a programming environment for concurrent 
      coordinated programming. With regard to software engineering, the two 
      first phases belong to the system design while the third one forms 
      the first implementation step.}

   ABSTRACT     = {The design and implementation of parallel algorithms for 
      distributed memory architectures is much harder than the development 
      of sequential algorithms. This is mainly due to the communication and 
      synchronization that is necessary to manage distributed data 
      correctly. This paper applies a methodology for the transformational 
      derivation of parallel programs using \emph{data distribution 
      algebras} that enable an abstract description of data distribution 
      issues. Algorithms are formulated using \emph{skeletons}, that is, 
      specialized higher-order functions with particular parallel 
      implementations. The methodology is applied to a the solution of a 
      \emph{system of ordinary differential equations} where convolutions 
      can be computed using the Fast Fourier transformation. The example 
      illustrates the practical optimization problems for a development 
      model of the visual system that involves large scale neural network 
      simulations. Finally, this algorithm is compared to an implementation 
      of the same system of equations in the programming language C* on a 
      CM-5.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Today there is no programming model or language support 
      which offers a uniform programming methodology on a wide variety of 
      parallel architectures. In this paper functional languages are 
      proposed as such a methodology using an extension of the concept of 
      {\em skeletons} --- higher-order functions coupled with parallel 
      implementation templates. An essential part of the proposed 
      methodology is the use of {\em data distribution algebras} as a 
      structured language concept to specify distribution issues explicitly 
      in a skeleton-based approach. It is shown how the {\em skeleton 
      composition problem} can be solved using data distribution algebras. 
      Finally the methodology is applied to the solution of partial 
      differential equations in the context of fluid dynamics.}

   ABSTRACT     = {OPAL is a scheme language, by which we understand that 
      it doesn't provide a priori more than the essential builtin data 
      types of boolean numbers and textual denotations. Consequently, the 
      OPAL compiler must support a way to add handcoded structures to the 
      compilation system without loosing efficiency compared to as data 
      types defined by these structures are built into the language. There 
      is a second --- even more important --- reason which is independent 
      of OPAL being a scheme language. In most cases software is not 
      constructed from scratch, but is embedded in and does embed existing 
      software: the operating system, the user interface, the data base 
      manager and so on. This calls for a well defined interlanguage 
      working interface. Nowadays C is the de facto standard for system 
      programming; hence, it is desirable that OPAL programs can corporate 
      with C software and vice versa. This manual describes on a technical 
      level how to add handcoded structures to the OPAL Compilation System 
      Version 2, and how to embed OPAL structures into C programs.}

   ABSTRACT     = { Parallel programming is intrinsically more difficult 
      than sequential programming. To this day there is no universal 
      programming methodology which provides a simple programming model 
      applicable to a wide range of architectures. In this report a 
      methodology is presented which aims at solving this dilemma using a 
      transformational approach based on skeletons. First steps towards a 
      general theory of skeletons are set up using results from sheaf 
      theory. These results provide the basis for the formal definition of 
      {\em data distribution algebras} underlying our definition of 
      skeletons. The papers presents several examples in some detail which 
      illustrate the use of the presented formalism in application domains 
      important to parallel programming. Keywords: functional programming, 
      parallel programming, skeleton, data distribution algebra.}
