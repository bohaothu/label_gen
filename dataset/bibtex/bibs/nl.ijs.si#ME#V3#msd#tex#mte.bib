  abstract = {We consider the task of tagging Slovene words with morphosyntactic
  descriptions (MSDs). MSDs contain not only part-of-speech
  information but also attributes such as gender and case. In the case
  of Slovene there are 2,083 possible MSDs. P-Progol was used to learn
  morphosyntactic disambiguation rules from annotated data (consisting
  of 161,314 examples) produced by the MULTEXT-East project.  P-Progol
  produced 1,148 rules taking 36 hours.  Using simple grammatical
  background knowledge, e.g.\ looking for case disagreement, P-Progol
  induced 4,094 clauses in eight parallel runs.  These rules have
  proved effective at detecting and explaining incorrect MSD
  annotations in an independent test set, but have not so far produced
  a tagger comparable to other existing taggers in terms of accuracy.}

                 method to the part-of-speech (POS) tagging of Hungarian
                 sentences. The task of AGLEARN is to infer the semantic
                 functions associated with production. In the learning
                 process the grammar, the background semantic functions
                 and the examples can be used. We applied the AGLEARN
                 method to infer context rules to choose the correct
                 tags. A corpus with about 100 000 pre-tagged words has
                 been used for training and testing. By using AGLEARN
                 method learning data are generated to the C 4.5
                 attribute value learner. These generated data contain
                 information about the phrase structure of the
                 sentences. A background attribute grammar has been used
                 to determine these sructural information. Our
                 experinces showed that using this structural background
                 information C4.5 learner was able to infer more precise
