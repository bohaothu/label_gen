                  technical companion report to [Tar96], where an
                  overview of various notions of a mapping between
                  institutions is given and some structural properties
                  of the resulting categories of institutions are
                  indicated. The main goal of the current report is to
                  provide technical statements of these results and to
                  prove them in sufficient detail. Some of the results
                  given here have been only hinted at in [Tar96], some
                  of them are repeated from [Tar96], and some are

                  various approaches to software specification and

                  the area is not just researchers' fancy, but results
                  from the very practical needs to capture various
                  aspects of software systems and to cater for various
