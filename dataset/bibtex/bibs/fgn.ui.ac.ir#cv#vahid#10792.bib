abstract = "-This research focuses on a discoursal element; namely, cohesive devices in terms of density, in Sa 'di's Gulistan. Sixteen stories from the second chapter of Gulistan (on the manner of dervishes)were selected and compared whit their translated versions by Arberry(1945), Ross, and Rehatsek(1964) . Cohesive devices, as language specific markers for holding relationship between parts of a text,were first identified and then classified  into gramatical and lexical cohesive ones. Grammatical cohesive devices comprise reference, substitution , ellipsis and conjunction while lexical cohesive devices coprise reiteration and collocation in which reiteration itself includes full repetition synonomy , superordinate and general word. The model followed in the researche was Halliday and Hasan's. The results obtained from the comparison of density of each type of cohesive devices between the original Persian text and the English  versions  reveal somme differences, even among the very  English versions. This suggests lack of one to one textual correspondance between the two genetically the same but typologically different languages, English and Persian, in so far as the base model is concerned.
