This paper presents a class software project that was part of a 
recent experimental graduate course on 
{\em Frontiers of Collaborative Computing on the Internet}. 
We chose Tcl/Tk to facilitate rapid prototyping, testing,
and demonstrating all phases of the project.
The major milestones achieved during this course are:
~{\large $\bullet$} rapid proficiency in Tcl/Tk that allowed each student 
to manipulate
data and widgets, apply socket programming principles, and create
a progression of client/server applications, from textbook 
cases to a  unique client/server architecture prototype  -- 
driven by and matched to a well-defined collaborative project driver.
~{\large $\bullet$} universal server that supports any number of 
user-configurable clients, each accessible through a Web-browser
on a Mac, Windows, or UNIX platforms.  Prototype client configurations 
include:
(1) collaborative document composition, (2) collaborative
Tcl/Tk debugging and compilation, (3) collaborative
design workflow.
