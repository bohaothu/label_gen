abstract = {Self-Organizing Maps are a type of Neural Network to model 
the brain's ability to self-organize and preserve the topological relationship
of the provided data.
However, as large models result in high computational complexity, it makes
sense to distribute the task among several computers in a cluster.
This thesis proposes a parallel implementation of Recurrent Self-Organizing
Maps using Message Passing Software for inter-process communication.
As a result, computing time can be reduced and a brain-like distributed
structure is obtained.},
