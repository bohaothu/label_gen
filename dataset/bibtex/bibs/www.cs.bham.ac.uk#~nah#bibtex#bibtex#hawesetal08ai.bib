  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the trade-offs available in the design space of intelligent
  systems is a major unaddressed element in the study of Artificial
  Intelligence. In this paper we approach this problem in two ways.
  First, we discuss the development of our integrated robotic system
  in terms of its trajectory through design space. Second, we demonstrate
  the practical implications of architectural design decisions by using
  this system as an experimental platform for comparing behaviourally
  similar yet architecturally different systems. The results of this
  show that our system occupies a "sweet spot" in design space in terms
  of the cost of moving information between processing components.}}
