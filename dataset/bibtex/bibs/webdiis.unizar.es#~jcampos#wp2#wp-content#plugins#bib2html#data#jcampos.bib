  abstract = {Software systems that do not meet their timing constraints
can cause risks. In this work we propose a comprehensive
method for assessing the risk of timing failure by evaluating the
software design. We show how to apply best practises in software engineering
and well-known Time Petri Net (TPN) modeling and analysis
techniques, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method with reference to a case study in the domain of realtime
embedded systems. The method customizes the Australian standard risk
management process, where the system context is the UML-based
software specification, enriched with standard MARTE profile
annotations to capture non-functional system properties. During
the risk analysis, a TPN is derived, via model transformation,
from the software design specification and TPN bound techniques
are applied to estimate the probability of timing failure. TPN
bound techniques are also exploited, within the risk evaluation
and treatment steps, to identify the risk causes in the software
design.},

  abstract = {Time Petri Nets (TPNs) have been widely used for the verification
	and validation of real-time systems during the software development
	process. Their quantitative analysis consists in applying enumerative
	techniques that suffer the well known state space explosion problem.
	To overcome this problem several methods have been proposed in the
	literature, that either provide rules to obtain equivalent nets with
	a reduced state space or avoid the construction of the whole state
	space. In this paper, we propose a method that consists in computing
	performance bounds to predict the average operational behavior of
	TPNs by exploiting their structural properties and by applying operational
	laws. Performance bound computation was first proposed for Timed
	(Timed PNs) and Stochastic Petri nets (SPNs). We generalize the results
	obtained for Timed PNs and SPNs to make the technique applicable
	to TPNs and their extended stochastic versions: TPN with firing frequency
	intervals (TPNFs) and Extended TPNs (XTPNs). Finally, we apply the
	proposed bounding techniques on the case study of a robot-control
	application taken from the literature.},

	addresses the UML StateCharts (SCs) and the Sequence Diagrams (SDs)

	Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets. The proposed derivation, actually
	the authors interpretation of the SC and SD, provides these two kinds

	is used as an example to illustrate how, following the proposal,
	the SC and the SD are automatically converted into GSPNs. Another
	contribution of the work is the consistency study among the SC and

  abstract = {Formal methods are the most suitable way to model and analyze several
	kinds of software systems. However, conventional methods are gaining
	placed in Software Engineering field because they can be easily applied
	in all the stages of the software life cycle. The combination of
	formal and conventional methods could be an interesting approach
	to describe and analyze some software aspects, as for example, the
	performance of the system. In this way, we make use of a software
	performance process enriched with formal techniques. The process
	has as important features that it uses UML as a design notation and
	it uses stochastic Petri nets as formal model. Petri nets provide
	a formal semantics for the system and a performance model, while
	UML supplies the framework and tools to document the system. The
	process is used in this article to present a performance comparison
	between software retrieval systems. Nowadays, there exist web sites
	that allow users to retrieve and install software in an easy way.
	The performance of these sites may be poor if they are used in wireless
	networks; the reason is the inadequate use of the net resources they
	need. In this article, we show that if this kind of systems are designed
	using mobile agent technology the previous problem might be avoided.},

	the intensive use of structure theory of net models allows to obtain
	very efficient computation techniques. The organization of the chapter
	is the following. In Section 17.1, a general approach for the computation
	of upper and lower bounds for arbitrary linear functions of average
	marking of places and throughput of transitions of both timed Place/Transition
	nets and timed Well-Formed Coloured nets is presented. Section 17.2

	upper bounds, even if it is valid only for restricted Petri net subclasses.
	The relation of this technique with the general approach and the
	attainability of the bound for a particular subclass of nets is included.

	transitions, respectively. All the bounds computed in Sections 17.1,
	17.2 and 17.3 are insensitive to the timing probability distributions
	since they are based only on the knowledge of the average service

	of strongly connected stochastic marked graphs (SMG's) is presented
	in this Chapter. We consider SMG's with time and marking independent
	exponentially distributed service times associated with transitions.
	The approach has two basic foundations. First, it is deeply based
	on qualitative theory of MG's. More precisely, given an arbitrary
	cut (subset of places producing a net partition), a structural decomposition
	technique is developed that allows us to split a strongly connected
	MG into two aggregated subsystems and a basic skeleton system. And
	what is more important, the behaviours of the subsystems, including
	steps, language of firing sequences and reachable markings, are equivalent
	to the whole system behaviour (projected on the corresponding subsets
	of nodes). Second, after the decomposition phase, an iterative response
	time approximation method is applied for the computation of the throughput.
	Experimental results on several examples generally have an error
	of less than 3%. The state space is usually reduced by more than
	one order of magnitude; therefore the analysis of otherwise intractable
	systems is possible. The Chapter is organized as follows. In Section
	23.1, some fundamental properties on MG's and implicit places are
	presented. Section 23.2 includes the structural decomposition of
	MG's used in the rest of the Chapter. The iterative technique for
	approximate throughput computation is described in Section 23.3.
	Section 23.4 includes several application examples to illustrate
	the introduced technique. Finally, some bibliographic remarks are

  abstract = {A goal of performance modelling with timed Petri nets (TPN's) is the
	estimation of some quantifiable performance measures of the system
	under consideration by the simulation or analysis of the model of
	the system behaviour. In order to do that, responsiveness and utilization
	performance measures of the system must be described in terms of
	average values of operational quantities defined on the TPN model,
	like the average marking of a place or the firing frequency of a
	transition. In Section 8.1, the usual average performance indices
	for TPN models are derived operationally from the basic observable
	events that were defined in Chapter 3. Sections 8.2 and 8.3 are devoted
	to exploit the operational approach for the definition of performance
	measures. In Section 8.2, operational analysis techniques are used
	to partially characterize the behaviour of TPN models. Classical
	operational laws, like Little's law are stated in Petri net terms.
	Additionally, some operational inequalities are derived that are
	typical of the presence of synchronization and that have not been
	considered before in the framework of queueing networks models. Section
	8.3 illustrates another aspect of the deep gap, from the analytical
	point of view, existing between classical monoclass product-form
	queueing networks and TPN's. While in Gordon-Newell networks the
	vector of visit ratios to the stations can be easily (efficiently)
	computed from the routing information, in the case of bounded TPN's
	the computability of such index is a quite complex problem. This
	problem leads to a classification of net models attending to the
	dependency of the visit ratios on the net structure and the probabilistic
	routing, on the initial marking, and on the firing time of transitions.
	Since few operational analysis techniques can presently be used to
	compute the performance indices of interest, the classical approach
	based on stochastic processes must be considered. Section 8.4 introduces
	also the definition of performance parameters on the TPN model as
	expected values of the random variables that characterize the behaviour
	of the model, under some stochastic assumptions. As the reader surely
	knows, under ergodicity conditions the average (operationally defined)
	performance indices are equal to the expected (stochastically defined)
	indices, thus the techniques that will be presented later on for
	the computation of expected values will be useful to compute the
	average performance measures of interest. Some bibliographic remarks
	are summarized in Section 8.5.},

  abstract = {As stated in previous chapters, a fundamental question in the use
	of stochastic Petri net models for performance evaluation, even under
	Markovian stochastic interpretation, is the so called state explosion
	problem. A general approach to deal with (computational) complexity
	is to use a divide and conquer strategy, what requires the definition
	of a decomposition method and the subsequent composition of partial
	results to get the full solution. On the other hand, the trade-off
	between computational cost and accuracy of the solution leads to
	the use of approximation or bounding techniques (for instance, throughput
	bounds can be computed in polynomial time on the number of transitions
	and places, see Chapter 17). In this context, a pragmatic compromise
	to be handled by the analyzer of a system concerns the definition
	of faithful models, that may be very complex to exactly analyse (what
	may lead to the use of approximation or just bounding techniques),
	or simplified models, for which exact analysis can be, eventually,
	accomplished. Divide and conquer strategies can be used with exact,
	approximate, or bounding techniques. The techniques for performance
	evaluation present in the literature consider either implicit or
	explicit decomposition of net models. In [7] (see Chapter 17), an
	implicit decomposition into P-semiflows is used for computing throughput
	bounds for arbitrary pdf of time durations. In [19] (see Chapter
	12), a decomposition into disjoint modules (usually subnets generated
	by P-semiflows) is defined by the analyzer or provided by model construction;
	the computational technique uses directly the information provided
	by the modules to compute exact global limit probability distribution
	vector. In [8], a decomposition into modules (connected through buffers)
	should also be provided. In this case, the modules are complemented
	with an abstract view of their environment in the full model, and
	the approximate solution is computed through an iterative technique
	looking for a fixed point (details will be presented in Chapter 23).
	In the sequel of this Chapter and in a general context, components
	will refer to (eventually) complemented modules. They are just the
	elements used to build the full solution. In order to get efficient
	techniques, the decomposition and, eventually, complementation process
	should be net-driven (i.e., derived at net level). For this, we shall
	use PN's structure theory concepts and techniques (e.g., P-semiflows,
	implicit places, etc.). The Chapter is organised as follows. The
	main ideas behind net-driven decompositions of PN's are introduced
	in Section 20.1: the conservative and consistent components (Section
	20.1.1), an example of implicit search technique into conservative
	components (Section 20.1.2), an explicit decomposition of nets, designating
	the modules to be used (Section 20.1.3), and the complementation
	of modules to get components (that include information from the environment),
	using implicit places (Section 20.1.4). A taxonomy for net-driven
	decomposition techniques is proposed in Section 20.2, providing a
	framework for the consideration of a significant number of performance
	evaluation methods. Several representative examples of techniques
	present in the literature are briefly overviewed and classified according
	with the classification criteria. Some concluding remarks are included
	in Section 20.3.},

  abstract = {Deterministically Synchronized Sequential Processes (DSSP) are essentially
	states machines that communicate, may be in complex forms but under
	some restricted patterns, through buffer places; their definition
	is compositional by nature. This paper considers the problem of exploiting
	this compositionality to generate the state space and to find the
	steady state probabilities of a stochastic extension of DSSP in a
	net-driven, efficient way. Essentially, we give an expresion of an
	auxiliary matrix, G, which is a supermatrix of the infinitesimal
	generator of a DSSP. G is a tensor algebra expression of matrices
	of the size of the components for which it is possible to numerically
	solve the characteristic equation pi.G = 0, without the need to explicitly
	compute G. Therefore, we obtain a method that computes the steady
	state solution of a DSSP without ever explicitly computing and storing
	its infinitesimal generator, and therefore without computing and
	storing the reachability graph of the system.},

  abstract = {La abstracci\'on de acciones es la base de la metodolog\'{\i}a de
	dise\~no descendente por refinamientos sucesivos, \'util para la
	resoluci\'on de peque\~nos problemas de tratamiento de informaci\'on.
	Sin embargo, para afrontar la construcci\'on de programas en media
	y gran escala es necesaria una metodolog\'{\i}a de dise\~no modular,
	que permita la partici\'on del trabajo en unidades de programa que
	puedan ser desarrolladas independientemente del resto. El prop\'osito
	de estos apuntes es presentar los principios b\'asicos de una metodolog\'{\i}a
	de dise\~no modular basada en la abstracci\'on de datos. Este material
	ha sido elaborado para servir como soporte de la asignatura Estructuras
	de datos y algoritmos, que se imparte en el tercer semestre de los
	estudios de Ingenier\'{\i}a Inform\'atica en el Centro Polit\'ecnico
	Superior de la Universidad de Zaragoza. Los alumnos que cursan dicha
	asignatura han seguido previamente dos semestres de programaci\'on
	en los que han debido aprender a especificar formalmente y dise\~nar
	programas en peque\~na escala, utilizando tipos de datos sencillos
	(como los predefinidos en un lenguaje de programaci\'on de la familia
	del Pascal); los alumnos conocen t\'ecnicas de dise\~no recursivo
	e iterativo, as\'{\i} como las herramientas b\'asicas para poder
	medir la eficiencia de los algoritmos (atendiendo a su tiempo de
	ejecuci\'on). No obstante, el material presentado puede ser \'util
	tambi\'en para un segundo nivel en todos aquellos planes de estudios
	en los que se incluyan dos cursos de programaci\'on de computadores.
	Pueden encontrarse en las librer\'{\i}as varios trabajos (muchos
	de ellos ya cl\'asicos) con t\'{\i}tulos similares o iguales a \'este.
	Sin embargo, y \'esta es la raz\'on para la existencia de uno nuevo,
	la aproximaci\'on al tema que se pretende desarrollar es bien diferente.
	De hecho, el t\'{\i}tulo que el autor habr\'{\i}a elegido, en caso
	de no haber optado por mantener el nombre de la asignatura antes
	mencionada, hubiese sido m\'as bien "Tipos abstractos de datos y
	algoritmos" o mejor "Introducci\'on a la programaci\'on con tipos
	abstractos de datos". La diferencia estriba en el \'enfasis que se
	pretende dar en las p\'aginas que siguen a la especificaci\'on formal
	de los tipos (de ah\'{\i} el t\'ermino "tipos abstractos de datos")
	como herramienta fundamental para el dise\~no modular de programas,
	en lugar de limitarse a presentar las estructuras de datos necesarias
	para representar los valores de los tipos definidos. El comentario
	anterior no debe hacer pensar al lector que el material que sigue
	es original del autor. Nada m\'as lejos de la realidad. \'Unicamente
	nos hemos limitado a enlazar las excelentes aproximaciones existentes
	en la literatura a la definici\'on y conceptos relacionados con los
	tipos abstractos de datos y su especificaci\'on algebraica (v\'eanse,
	por ejemplo, los dos \'ultimos cap\'{\i}tulos de la obra de Ricardo
	Pe\~na titulada Dise\~no de Programas. Formalismo y Abstracci\'on)
	con los trabajos m\'as cl\'asicos sobre estructuras de datos y algoritmos
	de manipulaci\'on (como, por ejemplo, Estructuras de Datos y Algoritmos,
	de Aho, Hopcroft y Ullman). Los apuntes est\'an estructurados en
	lecciones, agrupadas en grandes temas. En el primero de ellos, titulado
	"Tipos abstractos de datos", se presentan los conceptos fundamentales
	sobre los tipos abstractos de datos, su especificaci\'on formal (algebraica)
	y su utilizaci\'on en el dise\~no modular de programas. El segundo
	tema, "Tipos de datos lineales", introduce tres de los tipos abstractos
	lineales m\'as representativos y \'utiles en programaci\'on: las
	pilas, las colas y las listas con acceso por posici\'on. Para cada
	nuevo tipo presentado se incluyen su especificaci\'on formal, una
	o varias soluciones para la representaci\'on de sus valores, la implementaci\'on
	de las operaciones m\'as importantes, su coste computacional y algunos
	ejemplos de aplicaci\'on. El tercer tema, titulado "\'Arboles y esquemas
	algor\'{\i}tmicos", incluye los detalles sobre algunos de los tipos
	de \'arboles m\'as frecuentemente utilizados, como los \'arboles
	binarios, \'arboles ordenados, \'arboles de b\'usqueda, mont\'{\i}culos,
	..., y ejemplos de aplicaci\'on. Adem\'as se introducen los algoritmos
	de vuelta atr\'as y las heur\'{\i}sticas voraces. Los dos \'ultimos
	temas, sobre "Tipos de datos funcionales" (o tablas) e "Introducci\'on
	a los grafos", no se desarrollan con la misma extensi\'on que los
	anteriores por razones diferentes. En el caso de las tablas, tras
	las definiciones formales convenientes, se hace hincapi\'e en la
	representaci\'on mediante tablas dispersas basadas en la utilizaci\'on
	de una funci\'on de localizaci\'on (hashing, en ingl\'es) y en las
	tablas multidimensionales representadas mediante estructuras de listas
	m\'ultiples, pues otras representaciones posibles basadas en listas
	lineales o \'arboles de b\'usqueda no precisan mayor explicaci\'on
	tras el estudio de los temas previos. En cuanto a los grafos, los
	alumnos de Ingenier\'{\i}a Inform\'atica (a quienes va dirigida preferentemente
	esta obra) han cursado previamente una asignatura titulada "Matem\'atica
	discreta", en la que se les ha presentado el concepto de grafo y
	una buena colecci\'on de algoritmos para su manipulaci\'on. Por ello,
	y atendiendo a razones de completitud, se presentan s\'olo las especificaciones
	formales y varias alternativas de representaci\'on, junto a algunas
	consideraciones sobre el efecto que la elecci\'on de la representaci\'on
	tiene en el coste de los algoritmos de manipulaci\'on. Por \'ultimo,
	un comentario sobre las notaciones empleadas y los lenguajes de programaci\'on
	que pueden servir como soporte de pr\'acticas. Para la especificaci\'on
	algebraica de tipos abstractos, se utiliza una sintaxis similar a
	la del lenguaje OBJ, pero en espa\~nol. En cuanto a los m\'odulos,
	estructuras de datos y algoritmos, se emplea una notaci\'on algor\'{\i}tmica,
	tambi\'en en espa\~nol, que consiste en una extensi\'on modular de
	la notaci\'on utilizada en los apuntes sobre Introducci\'on a la
	programaci\'on, elaborados por Javier Mart\'{\i}nez y Javier Campos
	como soporte a la asignatura de igual nombre existente en el curriculum
	de Ingenier\'{\i}a Inform\'atica del CPS. En cuanto al lenguaje de
	programaci\'on soporte de las pr\'acticas, el autor desaconseja la
	utilizaci\'on de las extensiones modulares de Pascal (incluido el
	Modula 2), pues carecen de la posibilidad de definir tipos opacos
	y tipos gen\'ericos, siendo ambos mecanismos fundamentales en la
	metodolog\'{\i}a desarrollada. As\'{\i}, un lenguaje apropiado resulta
	ser el Ada, dotado de la posibilidad de definici\'on de tipos opacos
	y tipos gen\'ericos, con una sintaxis y sem\'antica bien pensadas
	y una dificultad de aprendizaje similar al Pascal, si se limita su
	presentaci\'on a la parte secuencial. Otras alternativas pueden encontrarse
	en lenguajes de programaci\'on orientados a objetos (como, por ejemplo,
	C++), dada la cercan\'{\i}a de los conceptos de "clase" y "tipo abstracto
	de dato".},

	of stochastic strongly connected marked graphs is presented. It generalizes
	a previous technique based on net decomposition through a single
	input-single output cut, allowing the split of the model through
	any cut. The approach has two basic foundations. First, a deep understanding
	of the qualitative behaviour of marked graphs leads to a general
	decomposition technique. Second, after the decomposition phase, an
	iterative response time approximation method is applied for the computation
	of the throughput. Experimental results on several examples generally
	have an error of less than 3%. The state space is usually reduced
	by more than one order of magnitude; therefore the analysis of otherwise
	intractable systems is possible.},

  abstract = {Product form queueing networks have long been used for the performance
	evaluation of computer systems. Their success has been due to their
	capability of naturally expressing sharing of resources and queueing,
	that are typical situations of traditional computer systems, as well
	as to their efficient solution algorithms, of polynomial complexity
	on the size of the model. Unfortunately, the introduction of synchronization
	constraints usually destroys the product form solution, so that general
	concurrent and distributed systems are not easily studied with this
	class of models. Petri nets have been proved specially adequate to
	model parallel and distributed systems. Moreover, they have a well-founded
	theory of analysis that allows to investigate a great number of qualitative
	properties of the system. In the original definition, Petri nets
	did not include the notion of time, and tried to model only the logical
	behaviour of systems by describing the causal relations existing
	among events. This approach showed its power in the specification
	and analysis of concurrent systems in a way independent of the concept
	of time. Nevertheless the introduction of a timing specification
	is essential if we want to use this class of models for the performance
	evaluation of distributed systems. One of the main problems in the
	actual use of timed and stochastic Petri net models for the quantitative
	evaluation of large systems is the explosion of the computational
	complexity of the analysis algorithms. In general, exact performance
	results are obtained from the numerical solution of a continuous
	time Markov chain, whose dimension is given by the size of the state
	space of the model. Structural computation of exact performance measures
	has been possible for some subclasses of nets such as those with
	state machine topology. These nets, under certain assumptions on
	the stochastic interpretation are isomorphic to Gordon and Newell's
	networks, in queueing theory terminology. In the general case, efficient
	methods for the derivation of performance measures are still needed.
	Two complementary approaches to the derivation of exact measures
	for the analysis of distributed systems are the utilization of approximation
	techniques and the computation of bounds. Approximate values for
	the performance parameters are in general more efficiently derived
	than the exact ones. On the other hand, "exactness'' only exists
	in theory! In other words, numerical algorithms must be applied in
	practice for the computation of exact values, therefore making errors
	is inevitable. Performance bounds are useful in the preliminary phases
	of the design of a system, in which many parameters are not known
	accurately. Several alternatives for those parameters should be quickly
	evaluated, and rejected those that are clearly bad. Exact (and even
	approximate) solutions would be computationally very expensive. Bounds
	become useful in these instances since they usually require much
	less computation effort. The computation of upper and lower bounds
	for the steady-state performance of timed and stochastic Petri nets
	is considered in this work. In particular, we study the throughput
	of transitions, defined as the average number of firings per time
	unit. For this measure we try to compute upper and lower bounds in
	polynomial time on the size of the net model, by means of proper
	linear programming problems defined from the incidence matrix of
	the net (in this sense, we develop structural techniques). These
	bounds depend only on the mean values and not on the higher moments
	of the probability distribution functions of the random variables
	that describe the timing of the system. The independence of the probability
	distributions can be viewed as a useful generalization of the performance
	results, since higher moments of the delays are usually unknown for
	real cases, and difficult to estimate and assess. From a different
	perspective, the obtained results can be applied to the analysis
	of queueing networks extended with some synchronization schemes.
	Monoclass queueing networks can be mapped on stochastic Petri nets.
	On the other hand, stochastic Petri nets can be interpreted as monoclass
	queueing networks augmented with synchronization primitives. Concerning
	the presentation of this manuscript, it should be mentioned that
	chapter 1 has been written with the object of giving the reader an
	outline of the stochastic Petri net model: its definition, terminology,
	basic properties, and related concepts, together with its deep relation
	with other classic stochastic network models. Chapter 2 is devoted
	to the presentation of the net subclasses considered in the rest
	of the work. The classification presented here is quite different
	from the one which is usual in the framework of Petri nets. The reason
	lies on the fact that our classification criterion, the computability
	of visit ratios for transitions, is introduced for the first time
	in the field of stochastic Petri nets in this work. The significance
	of that criterion is based on the important role that the visit ratios
	play in the computation of upper and lower bounds for the performance
	of the models. Nevertheless, classical important net subclasses are
	identified here in terms of the computability of their visit ratios
	from different parameters of the model. Chapter 3 is concerned with
	the computation of reachable upper and lower bounds for the most
	restrictive subclass of those presented in chapter 2: marked graphs.
	The explanation of this fact is easy to understand. The more simple
	is the model the more accessible will be the techniques an ideas
	for the development of good results. Chapter 4 provides a generalization
	for live and bounded free choice nets of the results presented in
	the previous chapter. Quality of obtained bounds is similar to that
	for strongly connected marked graphs: throughput lower bounds are
	reachable for bounded nets while upper bounds are reachable for 1-bounded
	nets. Chapter 5 considers the extension to other net subclasses,
	like mono-T-semiflow nets, FRT-nets, totally open deterministic systems
	of sequential processes, and persistent nets. The results are of
	diverse colours. For mono-T-semiflow nets and, therefore, for general
	FRT-nets, it is not possible (so far) to obtain reachable throughput
	bounds. On the other hand, for bounded ordinary persistent nets,
	tight throughput upper bounds are derived. Moreover, in the case
	of totally open deterministic systems of sequential processes the
	exact steady-state performance measures can be computed in polynomial
	time on the net size. In chapter 6 bounds for other interesting performance
	measures are derived from throughput bounds and from classical queueing
	theory laws. After that, we explore the introduction of more information
	from the probability distribution functions of service times in order
	to improve the bounds. In particular, for Coxian service delay of
	transitions it is possible to improve the throughput upper bounds
	of previous chapters which held for more general forms of distribution
	functions. This improvement shows to be specially fruitful for live
	and bounded free choice nets. Chapter 7 is devoted to case studies.
	Several examples taken from literature in the fields of distributed
	computing systems and manufacturing systems are modelled by means
	of stochastic Petri nets and evaluated using the techniques developed
	in previous chapters. Finally, some concluding remarks and considerations
	on possible extensions of the work are presented.},

  abstract = {Steady-state performance evaluation of some repetitive automated manufacturing
	systems modelled by means of stochastic or deterministic timed Petri
	nets is considered. Basically, concepts and techniques developed
	by the authors in other works are applied to repetitive manufacturing
	systems in this paper. Linear programming problems defined on the
	incidence matrix of the underlying Petri nets are used to compute
	tight upper and lower bounds for the performance measures of job-shop
	systems and decision-free kanban systems in polynomial time on the
	net structure. The results can be extended to other models in which
	some decisions are allowed, such as producer-consumer systems with
	mutual exclusion. Exact performance measures for a class of systems
	containing sequential processes can be computed in polynomial time.},

  abstract = {Proving properties of Place/Transition Nets through Linear Algebraic
	Techniques is very interesting because of the polynomial complexity
	of the algorithms used for this purpose. In this sense, many works
	have been devoted to the linear analysis of marking related properties
	(e.g. boundedness of the state space, mutual exclusions, etc.). Nevertheless,
	few results exist related to linear analysis of liveness properties.
	In this note, we investigate some applications of linear techniques
	to partial characterization of liveness properties. First, a necessary
	condition for structural liveness in structural bounded nets is presented.
	It is based on the rank of the incidence matrix. Finally, given an
	initial marking, some sufficient conditions for dead transitions
	and for deadlock-freeness are presented.},
