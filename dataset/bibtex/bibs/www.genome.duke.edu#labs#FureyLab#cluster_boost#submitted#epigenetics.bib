  Abstract = {Aberrant DNA methylation of CpG sites is among the earliest and most frequent alterations in cancer. Several studies suggest that aberrant methylation occurs in a tumour type-specific manner. However, large-scale analysis of candidate genes has so far been hampered by the lack of high throughput assays for methylation detection. We have developed the first microarray-based technique which allows genome-wide assessment of selected CpG dinucleotides as well as quantification of methylation at each site. Several hundred CpG sites were screened in 76 samples from four different human tumour types and corresponding healthy controls. Discriminative CpG dinucleotides were identified for different tissue type distinctions and used to predict the tumour class of as yet unknown samples with high accuracy using machine learning techniques. Some CpG dinucleotides correlate with progression to malignancy, whereas others are methylated in a tissue-specific manner independent of malignancy. Our results demonstrate that genome-wide analysis of methylation patterns combined with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques constitute a powerful novel tool to classify human cancers.},

  Volume = {191},
  Number = {5},
  Pages = {1552-1572},
  Abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of all gynecologic neoplasms. Early-stage malignancy is frequently asymptomatic and difficult to detect and thus, by the time of diagnosis, most women have advanced disease. Most of these patients, although initially responsive, eventually develop and succumb to drug-resistant metastases. The success of typical postsurgical regimens, usually a platinum/taxane combination, is limited by primary tumors being intrinsically refractory to treatment and initially responsive tumors becoming refractory to treatment, due to the emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells. This review highlights a prominent role for epigenetics, particularly aberrant DNA methylation and histone acetylation, in both intrinsic and acquired drug-resistance genetic pathways in ovarian cancer. Administration of therapies that reverse epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors and other genes involved in drug response cascades could prove useful in the management of drug-resistant ovarian cancer patients. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the use of methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors and possible synergistic combinations of these to achieve maximal tumor suppressor gene re-expression. Moreover, when used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, epigenetic-based therapies may provide a means to resensitize ovarian tumors to the proven cytotoxic activities of conventional chemotherapeutics.},

  Journal = {Bioinformatics},
  Volume = {16},
  Number = {10},

  Abstract = {Motivation: DNA structure plays an important role in a variety of biological processes. Different di- and tri-nucleotide scales have been proposed to capture various aspects of DNA structure including base stacking energy, propeller twist angle, protein deformability, bendability, and position preference. Yet, a general framework for the computational analysis and prediction of DNA structure is still lacking. Such a framework should in particular address the following issues: (1) construction of sequences with extremal properties; (2) quantitative evaluation of sequences with respect to a given genomic background; (3) automatic extraction of extremal sequences and profiles from genomic databases; (4) distribution and asymptotic behavior as the length Nof the sequences increases; and (5) complete analysis of correlations between scales. Results: We develop a general framework for sequence analysis  based on additive scales, structural or other, that addresses all these issues. We show how to construct extremal sequences and calibrate scores for automatic genomic and database extraction. We show that distributions rapidly converge to normality as  Nincreases. Pairwise correlations between scales depend both on background distribution and sequence length and rapidly  converge to an analytically predictable asymptotic value. For di- and tri-nucleotide scales, normal behavior and asymptotic  correlation values are attained over a characteristic window length of about 10-15 bp. With a uniform background distribution, pairwise correlations between empirically-derived scales remain relatively small and roughly constant at all lengths, except for propeller twist and protein deformability which are positively correlated. There is a positive (resp. negative) correlation between dinucleotide base stacking (resp. propeller twist and protein deformability) and AT-content that increases in magnitude with length. The framework is applied to the analysis of various DNA tandem repeats. We derive exact expressions for counting the number of repeat unit classes at all lengths. Tandem repeats are likely to result from a variety of different mechanisms, a fraction of which is likely to depend on profiles characterized by extreme structural features.

  Abstract = {We describe herein a computationally intensive project aimed at carrying out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including water and counterions on B-DNA oligomers containing all 136 unique tetranucleotide base sequences. This initiative was undertaken by an international collaborative effort involving nine research groups, the Ascona B-DNA Consortium (ABC). Calculations were carried out on the 136 cases imbedded in 39 DNA oligomers with repeating tetranucleotide sequences, capped on both ends by GC pairs and each having a total length of 15 nucleotide pairs. All MD simulations were carried out using a well-defined protocol, the AMBER suite of programs, and the parm94 force field. Phase I of the ABC project involves a total of [~]0.6 {micro}s of simulation for systems containing [~]24,000 atoms. The resulting trajectories involve 600,000 coordinate sets and represent [~]400 gigabytes of data. In this article, the research design, details of the simulation protocol, informatics issues, and the organization of the results into a web-accessible database are described. Preliminary results from 15-ns MD trajectories are presented for the d(CpG) step in its 10 unique sequence contexts, and issues of stability and convergence, the extent of quasiergodic problems, and the possibility of long-lived conformational substates are discussed.},

  Journal = {Biopolymers},
  Volume = {73},
  Number = {3},
  Pages = {380-403},
  Abstract = {Recent studies of DNA axis curvature and flexibility based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on DNA are reviewed. The MD simulations are on DNA sequences up to 25 base pairs in length, including explicit consideration of counterions and waters in the computational model. MD studies are described for ApA steps, A-tracts, for sequences of A-tracts with helix phasing. In MD modeling, ApA steps and A-tracts in aqueous solution are essentially straight, relatively rigid, and exhibit the characteristic features associated with the B?-form of DNA. The results of MD modeling of A-tract oligonucleotides are validated by close accord with corresponding crystal structure results and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) structures of d(CGCGAATTCGCG) and d(GGCAAAAAACGG). MD simulation successfully accounts for enhanced axis curvature in a set of three sequences with phased A-tracts studied to date. The primary origin of the axis curvature in the MD model is found at those pyrimidine/purine YpR ?flexible hinge points? in a high roll, open hinge conformational substate. In the MD model of axis curvature in a DNA sequence with both phased A-tracts and YpR steps, the A-tracts appear to act as positioning elements that make the helix phasing more precise, and key YpR steps in the open hinge state serve as curvature elements. Our simulations on a phased A-tract sequence as a function of temperature show that the MD simulations exhibit a premelting transition in close accord with experiment, and predict that the mechanism involves a B?-to-B transition within A-tracts coupled with the prediction of a transition in key YpR steps from the high roll, open hinge, to a low roll, closed hinge substate. Diverse experimental observations on DNA curvature phenomena are examined in light of the MD model with no serious discrepancies. The collected MD results provide independent support for the ?non-A-tract model? of DNA curvature. The ?junction model? is indicated to be a special case of the non-A-tract model when there is a Y base at the 5? end of an A-tract. In accord with crystallography, the ?ApA wedge model? is not supported by MD.  2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 73: 380-403, 2004},

  Pages = {4302-4308},
  Abstract = {DNA methylation plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. The most common type of DNA modification consists of the methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide. At the present time, there is no method available for the prediction of DNA methylation sites. Therefore, in this study we have developed a support vector machine (SVM)-based method for the prediction of cytosine methylation in CpG dinucleotides. Initially a SVM module was developed from human data for the prediction of human-specific methylation sites. This module achieved a MCC and AUC of 0.501 and 0.814, respectively, when evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of this SVM-based module was better than the classifiers built using alternative machine learning and statistical algorithms including artificial neural networks, Bayesian statistics, and decision trees. Additional SVM modules were also developed based on mammalian- and vertebrate-specific methylation patterns. The SVM module based on human methylation patterns was used for genome-wide analysis of methylation sites. This analysis demonstrated that the percentage of methylated CpGs is higher in UTRs as compared to exonic and intronic regions of human genes. This method is available on line for public use under the name of Methylator at http://bio.dfci.harvard.edu/Methylator/.},

  Abstract = {We have developed a high-throughput method for analyzing the methylation status of hundreds of preselected genes simultaneously and have applied it to the discovery of methylation signatures that distinguish normal from cancer tissue samples. Through an adaptation of the GoldenGate genotyping assay implemented on a BeadArray platform, the methylation state of 1536 specific CpG sites in 371 genes (one to nine CpG sites per gene) was measured in a single reaction by multiplexed genotyping of 200 ng of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA. The assay was used to obtain a quantitative measure of the methylation level at each CpG site. After validating the assay in cell lines and normal tissues, we analyzed a panel of lung cancer biopsy samples (N = 22) and identified a panel of methylation markers that distinguished lung adenocarcinomas from normal lung tissues with high specificity. These markers were validated in a second sample set (N = 24). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for reliably profiling many CpG sites in parallel for the discovery of informative methylation markers. The technology should prove useful for DNA methylation analyses in large populations, with potential application to the classification and diagnosis of a broad range of cancers and other diseases.},

  Journal = {PLoS Genet.},
  Volume = {2},
  Number = {3},
  Pages = {e26},
  Abstract = {CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. The majority of CpG islands is normally unmethylated, but a sizeable fraction is prone to become methylated in various cell types and pathological situations. The goal of this study is to show that a computational epigenetics approach can discriminate between CpG islands that are prone to methylation from those that remain unmethylated. We develop a bioinformatics scoring and prediction method on the basis of a set of 1,184 DNA attributes, which refer to sequence, repeats, predicted structure, CpG islands, genes, predicted binding sites, conservation, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These attributes are scored on 132 CpG islands across the entire human Chromosome 21, whose methylation status was previously established for normal human lymphocytes. Our results show that three groups of DNA attributes, namely certain sequence patterns, specific DNA repeats, and a particular DNA structure, are each highly correlated with CpG island methylation (correlation coefficients of 0.64, 0.66, and 0.49, respectively). We predicted, and subsequently experimentally examined 12 CpG islands from human Chromosome 21 with unknown methylation patterns and found more than 90&\#037; of our predictions to be correct. In addition, we applied our prediction method to analyzing Human Epigenome Project methylation data on human Chromosome 6 and again observed high prediction accuracy. In summary, our results suggest that DNA composition of CpG islands (sequence, repeats, and structure) plays a significant role in predisposing CpG islands for DNA methylation. This finding may have a strong impact on our understanding of changes in CpG island methylation in development and disease.},

We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

  Journal = {Nature Genetics},
  Volume = {21},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {103-107},
  Abstract = {Densely methylated DNA associates with transcriptionally repressive chromatin characterized by the presence of underacetylated histones. Recently, these two epigenetic processes have been dynamically linked. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 appears to reside in a complex with histone deacetylase activity. MeCP2 can mediate formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin on methylated promoter templates in vitro, and this process can be reversed by trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase. Little is known, however, about the relative roles of methylation and histone deacetylase activity in the stable inhibition of transcription on densely methylated endogenous promoters, such as those for silenced alleles of imprinted genes, genes on the female inactive X chromosome and tumour-suppressor genes inactivated in cancer cells. We show here that the hypermethylated genes MLH1, TIMP3 (TIMP-3), CDKN2B (INK4B, p15) and CDKN2A (INK4, p16) cannot be transcriptionally reactivated with TSA alone in tumour cells in which we have shown that TSA alone can upregulate the expression of non-methylated genes. Following minimal demethylation and slight gene reactivation in the presence of low dose 5-aza-2deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC), however, TSA treatment results in robust re-expression of each gene. TSA does not contribute to demethylation of the genes, and none of the treatments alter the chromatin structure associated with the hypermethylated promoters. Thus, although DNA methylation and histone deacetylation appear to act as synergistic layers for the silencing of genes in cancer, dense CpG island methylation is dominant for the stable maintenance of a silent state at these loci.

  Abstract = {An analysis of the human chromosome 22 genomic sequence shows that both Z-DNA forming regions (ZDRs) and promoter sites for nuclear factor-I (NFI) are correlated with the locations of known and predicted genes across the chromosome and accumulate around the transcriptional start sites of the known genes. Thus, the occurrence of Z-DNA across human genomic sequences mirrors that of a known eukaryotic transcription factor. In addition, 43 of the 383 fully annotated chromosomal genes have ZDRs within 2 nucleosomes upstream of strong NFIs. This suggests a distinct class of human genes that may potentially be transcriptionally regulated by a mechanism that couples Z-DNA with NFI activation, similar to the mechanism previously elucidated for the human colony stimulation factor-I promoter [Liu et al. (2001) Cell, 106, 309-318]. The results from this study will facilitate the design of experimental studies to test the generality of this mechanism for other genes in the cell.},

  Pages = {1062-1072},
  Abstract = {Motivation: Many problems in molecular biology as well as other  areas involve detection of rare events in unbalanced data. We develop two sample stratification schemes in conjunction with neural networks for rare event detection in such databases. Sample stratification is a technique for making each class in a sample have equal influence on decision making. The first scheme proposed stratifies a sample by adding up the weighted sum of the derivatives during the backward pass of training. The second scheme proposed uses a technique of modified bootstrap aggregating. After training neural networks with multiple sets of bootstrapped examples of the  rare event classes and subsampled examples of common event classes, multiple voting for classification is performed. Results: These two schemes make rare event classes have a better  chance of being included in the sample used for training neural  networks and thus improve the classification accuracy for rare event detection. The experimental performance of the two schemes using two sets of human DNA sequences as well as another set of Gaussian data indicates that proposed schemes have the potential of significantly improving accuracy of neural networks to recognize rare events.

  Abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including water and counterions on B-DNA oligomers containing all 136 unique tetranucleotide basepair steps are reported. The objective is to obtain the calculated dynamical structure for at least two copies of each case, use the results to examine issues with regard to convergence and dynamical stability of MD on DNA, and determine the significance of sequence context effects on all unique dinucleotide steps. This information is essential to understand sequence effects on DNA structure and has implications on diverse problems in the structural biology of DNA. Calculations were carried out on the 136 cases embedded in 39 DNA oligomers with repeating tetranucleotide sequences, capped on both ends by GC pairs and each having a total length of 15 nucleotide pairs. All simulations were carried out using a well-defined state-of-the-art MD protocol, the AMBER suite of programs, and the parm94 force field. In a previous article (Beveridge et al. 2004. Biophysical Journal. 87:3799-3813), the research design, details of the simulation protocol, and informatics issues were described. Preliminary results from 15 ns MD trajectories were presented for the d(CpG) step in all 10 unique sequence contexts. The results indicated the sequence context effects to be small for this step, but revealed that MD on DNA at this length of trajectory is subject to surprisingly persistent cooperative transitions of the sugar-phosphate backbone torsion angles{alpha} and{gamma} . In this article, we report detailed analysis of the entire trajectory database and occurrence of various conformational substates and its impact on studies of context effects. The analysis reveals a possible direct correspondence between the sequence-dependent dynamical tendencies of DNA structure and the tendency to undergo transitions that trap them in nonstandard conformational substates. The difference in mean of the observed basepair step helicoidal parameter distribution with different flanking sequence sometimes differs by as much as one standard deviation, indicating that the extent of sequence effects could be significant. The observations reveal that the impact of a flexible dinucleotide such as CpG could extend beyond the immediate basepair neighbors. The results in general provide new insight into MD on DNA and the sequence-dependent dynamical structural characteristics of DNA.},

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Microarray technology is increasingly being applied in biological and medical research to address a wide range of problems, such as the classification of tumors. An important statistical problem associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene-expression profiles. Two essential aspects of this clustering problem are: to estimate the number of clusters, if any, in a dataset; and to allocate tumor samples to these clusters, and assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. Here we address the first of these problems.RESULTS:We have developed a new prediction-based resampling method, Clest, to estimate the number of clusters in a dataset. The performance of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene-expression data from four recently published cancer microarray studies. Clest was generally found to be more accurate and robust than the six existing methods considered in the study.CONCLUSIONS:Focusing on prediction accuracy in conjunction with resampling produces accurate and robust estimates of the number of clusters.},

  Number = {21},
  Pages = {12253-12258},
  Abstract = {Epigenetic silencing associated with aberrant methylation of promoter region CpG islands is one mechanism leading to loss of tumor suppressor function in human cancer. Profiling of CpG island methylation indicates that some genes are more frequently methylated than others, and that each tumor type is associated with a unique set of methylated genes. However, little is known about why certain genes succumb to this aberrant event. To address this question, we used Restriction Landmark Genome Scanning to analyze the susceptibility of 1,749 unselected CpG islands to de novo methylation driven by overexpression of DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). We found that although the overall incidence of CpG island methylation was increased in cells overexpressing DNMT1, not all loci were equally affected. The majority of CpG islands (69.9\$\%\$) were resistant to de novo methylation, regardless of DNMT1 overexpression. In contrast, we identified a subset of methylation-prone CpG islands (3.8\$\%\$) that were consistently hypermethylated in multiple DNMT1 overexpressing clones. Methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands were not significantly different with respect to size, C+G content, CpG frequency, chromosomal location, or promoter association. We used DNA pattern recognition and supervised learning techniques to derive a classification function based on the frequency of seven novel sequence patterns that was capable of discriminating methylation-prone from methylation-resistant CpG islands with 82\$\%\$ accuracy. The data indicate that CpG islands differ in their intrinsic susceptibility to de novo methylation, and suggest that the propensity for a CpG island to become aberrantly methylated can be predicted based on its sequence context.},

  Pages = {572-579},
  Abstract = {Epigenetic silencing involving the aberrant methylation of promoter region CpG islands is widely recognized as a tumor suppressor silencing mechanism in cancer. However, the molecular pathways underlying aberrant DNA methylation remain elusive. Recently we showed that, on a genome-wide level, CpG island loci differ in their intrinsic susceptibility to aberrant methylation and that this susceptibility can be predicted based on underlying sequence context. These data suggest that there are sequence/structural features that contribute to the protection from or susceptibility to aberrant methylation. Here we use motif elicitation coupled with classification techniques to identify DNA sequence motifs that selectively define methylation-prone or methylation-resistant CpG islands. Motifs common to 28 methylation-prone or 47 methylation-resistant CpG island-containing genomic fragments were determined using the MEME and MAST algorithms (http://meme.sdsc.edu). The five most discriminatory motifs derived from methylation-prone sequences were found to be associated with CpG islands in general and were nonrandomly distributed throughout the genome. In contrast, the eight most discriminatory motifs derived from the methylation-resistant CpG islands were randomly distributed throughout the genome. Interestingly, this latter group tended to associate with Alu and other repetitive sequences. Used together, the frequency of occurrence of these motifs successfully discriminated methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG island groups with an accuracy of 87\$\%\$ after 10-fold cross-validation. The motifs identified here are candidate methylation-targeting or methylation-protection DNA sequences.},

However, most monozygotic twin pairs are not identical; several types of phenotypic discordance may be observed, such as differences in susceptibilities to disease and a wide range of anthropomorphic features. There are several possible explanations for these observations, but one is the existence of epigenetic differences. To address this issue, we examined the global and locus-specific differences in DNA methylation and histone acetylation of a large cohort of monozygotic twins. We found that, although twins are epigenetically indistinguishable during the early years of life, older monozygous twins exhibited remarkable differences in their overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation, affecting their gene-expression portrait. These findings indicate how an appreciation of epigenetics is missing from our understanding of how different phenotypes can be originated from the same genotype.},

  Abstract = {A recent study revealed that TATA boxes and initiator sequences have a common anomalous mechanical property, i.e. they comprise distinctive flexible and rigid sequences when compared with the other parts of the promoter region. In the present study, using the flexibility parameters from two different models, we calculated the average flexibility profiles of 1004 human promoters that do not contain canonical promoter elements, such as a TATA box, initiator (Inr) sequence, downstream promoter element or a GC box, and those of 382 human promoters that contain the GC box only. Here, we show that they have a common characteristic mechanical property that is strikingly similar to those of the TATA box-containing or Inr-containing promoters. Their most interesting feature is that the TATA- or Inr-corresponding region lies in the several nucleotides around the transcription start site. We have also found that a dinucleotide step from -1 to +1 (transcription start site) has a slight tendency to adopt CA that is known to be flexible. We also demonstrate that certain synthetic DNA fragments designed to mimic the average mechanical property of these 1386 promoters can drive transcription. This distinctive mechanical property may be the hallmark of a promoter.},

   Abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarray experiments generating thousands of gene expression measurements, are being used to gather information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences that will be useful in diagnosing disease. We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results.  Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment   results for 97802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly   differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets.  Availability: The SVM software is available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~bgrundy/svm.

  Abstract = {We have constructed the potential energy surfaces for all unique tetramers, hexamers and octamers in double helical DNA, as a function of the two principal degrees of freedom, slide and shift at the central step. From these potential energy maps, we have calculated a database of structural and flexibility properties for each of these sequences. These properties include: the values of each of the six step parameters (twist roll, tilt, rise, slide and shift), for each step of the sequence; flexibility measures for both decrease and increase in each property value from the minimum energy conformation for the central step; and the deviation from the path of a hypothetical straight octamer. In an analysis of structural change as a function of sequence length, we observe that almost all DNA tends to B-DNA and becomes less flexible. A more detailed analysis of octamer properties has allowed us to determine the structural preferences of particular sequence elements. GGC and GCC sequences tend to confer bistability, low stability and a predisposition to A-form DNA, whereas AA steps strongly prefer B-DNA and inhibit A-structures. There is no correlation between flexibility and intrinsic curvature, but bent DNA is less stable than straight. The most difficult deformation is undertwisting. The TA step stands out as the most flexible sequence element with respect to decreasing twist and increasing roll. However, as with the structural properties, this behavior is highly context-dependent and some TA steps are very straight.},

   Abstract = {This paper introduces a novel generic approach for minimum number of feature selection for
classification problems with an objective function to maximize the classification accuracy and
allowance for variable swapping in the search for relevance e.g. biologic functions. The method is
illustrated on several case studies of gene expression data. Our approach integrates filter and wrapper
gene selection methods with an added objective of selecting a small set of non-redundant genes that
are most relevant for classification with the provision of bins for genes to be swapped and thus
selected for their biological relevance. It is capable of selecting relatively few marker genes while
giving comparable or better leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy compared to gene ranking
selection approaches. Additionally, gene profiles can be extracted from the evolving connectionist
system, which provides a set of rules that can be further developed into expert systems. The approach
uses an integration of Pearson correlation coefficient and signal-to-noise ratio methods with an
adaptive evolving classifier applied through the leave one out method for validation. Four case study
datasets of gene expression are used to illustrate the method. The results show the proposed approach
leads to an improved feature selection process in terms of reducing the number of variables required
and increased classification accuracy.},

  Volume = {99},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {327-332},
  Abstract = {To test whether regions undergoing genomic imprinting have unique genomic characteristics, imprinted and nonimprinted human loci were compared for nucleotide and retroelement composition. Maternally and paternally expressed subgroups of imprinted genes were found to differ in terms of guanine and cytosine, CpG, and retroelement content, indicating a segregation into distinct genomic compartments. Imprinted regions have been normally permissive to L1 long interspersed transposable element retroposition during mammalian evolution but universally and significantly lack short interspersed transposable elements (SINEs). The primate-specific Alu SINEs, as well as the more ancient mammalian-wide interspersed repeat SINEs, are found at significantly low densities in imprinted regions. The latter paleogenomic signature indicates that the sequence characteristics of currently imprinted regions existed before the mammalian radiation. Transitions from imprinted to nonimprinted genomic regions in cis are characterized by a sharp inflection in SINE content, demonstrating that this genomic characteristic can help predict the presence and extent of regions undergoing imprinting. During primate evolution, SINE accumulation in imprinted regions occurred at a decreased rate compared with control loci. The constraint on SINE accumulation in imprinted regions may be mediated by an active selection process. This selection could be because of SINEs attracting and spreading methylation, as has been found at other loci. Methylation-induced silencing could lead to deleterious consequences at imprinted loci, where inactivation of one allele is already established, and expression is often essential for embryonic growth and survival.},

  Abstract = {Mammalian DNA methyltransferases methylate cytosine residues within CG dinucleotides. By statistical analysis of published data of the Human Epigenome Project we have determined flanking sequences of up to [plus-or-minus sign]four base-pairs surrounding the central CG site that are characteristic of high (5'-CTTGCGCAAG-3') and low (5'-TGTTCGGTGG-3') levels of methylation in human genomic DNA. We have investigated the influence of flanking sequence on the catalytic activity of the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b de novo DNA methyltransferases using a set of synthetic oligonucleotide substrates that covers all possible [plus-or-minus sign]1 flanks in quantitative terms. Methylation kinetics experiments revealed a >13-fold difference between the preferred (RCGY) and disfavored [plus-or-minus sign]1 flanking base-pairs (YCGR). In addition, AT-rich flanks are preferred over GC-rich ones. These experimental preferences coincide with the genomic methylation patterns. Therefore, we have expanded our experimental analysis and found a >500-fold difference in the methylation rates of the consensus sequences for high and low levels of methylation in the genome. This result demonstrates a very pronounced flanking sequence preference of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. It suggests that the methylation pattern of human DNA is due, in part, to the flanking sequence preferences of the de novo DNA MTases and that flanking sequence preferences could be involved in the origin of CG islands. Furthermore, similar flanking sequence preferences have been found for the stimulation of the immune system by unmethylated CGs, suggesting a co-evolution of DNA MTases and the immune system.},

  Volume = {22},

  Abstract = {Motivation: Inclusion body formation has been a major deterrent for overexpression studies since a large number of proteins form insoluble inclusion bodies when overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The formation of inclusion bodies is known to be an outcome of improper protein folding; thus the composition and arrangement of amino acids in the proteins would be a major influencing factor in deciding its aggregation propensity. There is a significant need for a prediction algorithm that would enable the rational identification of both mutants and also the ideal protein candidates for mutations that would confer higher solubility-on-overexpression instead of the presently used trial-and-error procedures. Results: Six physicochemical properties together with residue and dipeptide-compositions have been used to develop a support vector machine-based classifier to predict the overexpression status in E.coli. The prediction accuracy is [~]72\$\%\$ suggesting that it performs reasonably well in predicting the propensity of a protein to be soluble or to form inclusion bodies. The algorithm could also correctly predict the change in solubility for most of the point mutations reported in literature. This algorithm can be a useful tool in screening protein libraries to identify soluble variants of proteins. Avalibility: Software is available on request from the authors.

RASSF1A was most frequently methylated (complete methylation in 7 and partial methylation in 4 cell lines), followed by ESR1 (5 and 2, respectively), FLNC (4 and 4), HAND1 (4 and 2), LOX (3 and 2), HRASLS (3 and 2), MGMT (3 and 0), CDKN2A (3 and 0), THBD (2 and 1), hMLH1 (2 and 0), CDH1 (1 and 1) and GSTP1 (1 and 0). hTERC and TIMP3 were only partially methylated in 7 and 2 cell lines, respectively. BRCA1 was not methylated at all. Aberrant demethylation of MAGE-A3, -B2 and -A1 was detected in 8, 4 and 3 cell lines, respectively. Gene expression was consistently absent in cell lines without unmethylated DNA molecules. Aberrant methylation was frequently observed in MCAS, RMUG-L (mucinous cell carcinomas), RTSG (poorly-differentiated carcinoma) and TYK-nu (undifferentiated carcinoma) while infrequent in HTOA, JHOS-2, and OV-90 (serous cell carcinomas). Aberrant demethylation was frequently observed in OV-90, OVK-18, and ES-2 cell lines. It was shown that aberrant methylation and demethylation were frequently observed in ovarian cancer cell lines, and these data will provide a basis for further epigenetic analysis in ovarian cancers.},

  Abstract = {Early studies of human Alu retrotransposons focused on their origin, evolution and biological properties, but current focus is shifting toward the effect of Alu elements on evolution of the human genome. Recent analyses indicate that numerous factors have affected the chromosomal distribution of Alu elements over time, including male-driven insertions, deletions and rapid CpG mutations after their retrotransposition. Unequal crossing over between Alu elements can lead to local mutations or to large segmental duplications responsible for genetic diseases and long-term evolutionary changes. Alu elements can also affect human (primate) evolution by introducing alternative splice sites in existing genes. Studying the Alu family in a human genomic context is likely to have general significance for our understanding of the evolutionary impact of other repetitive elements in diverse eukaryotic genomes.},

  Journal = {Bioinformatics},
  Volume = {20},

  Pages = {3005-3012},
  Abstract = {Motivation: Methylation of cytosines in DNA plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, and the analysis of methylation patterns is fundamental for the understanding of cell differentiation, aging processes, diseases and cancer development. Such analysis has been limited, because technologies for detailed and efficient high-throughput studies have not been available. We have developed a novel quantitative methylation analysis algorithm and workflow based on direct DNA sequencing of PCR products from bisulfite-treated DNA with high-throughput sequencing machines. This technology is a prerequisite for success of the Human Epigenome Project, the first large genome-wide sequencing study for DNA methylation in many different tissues. Methylation in tissue samples which are compositions of different cells is a quantitative information represented by cytosine/thymine proportions after bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil and PCR. Calculation of quantitative methylation information from base proportions represented by different dye signals in four-dye sequencing trace files needs a specific algorithm handling imbalanced and overscaled signals, incomplete conversion, quality problems and basecaller artifacts. Results: The algorithm we developed has several key properties: it analyzes trace files from PCR products of bisulfite-treated DNA sequenced directly on ABI machines; it yields quantitative methylation measurements for individual cytosine positions after alignment with genomic reference sequences, signal normalization and estimation of effectiveness of bisulfite treatment; it works in a fully automated pipeline including data quality monitoring; it is efficient and avoids the usual cost of multiple sequencing runs on subclones to estimate DNA methylation. The power of our new algorithm is demonstrated with data from two test systems based on mixtures with known base compositions and defined methylation. In addition, the applicability is proven by identifying CpGs that are differentially methylated in real tissue samples.},

  Abstract = {Imprinted genes are epigenetically modified genes whose expression is determined according to their parent of origin. They are involved in embryonic development, and imprinting dysregulation is linked to cancer, obesity, diabetes, and behavioral disorders such as autism and bipolar disease. Herein, we train a statistical model based on DNA sequence characteristics that not only identifies potentially imprinted genes, but also predicts the parental allele from which they are expressed. Of 23,788 annotated autosomal mouse genes, our model identifies 600 (2.5\$\%\$) to be potentially imprinted, 64\$\%\$ of which are predicted to exhibit maternal expression. These predictions allowed for the identification of putative candidate genes for complex conditions where parent-of-origin effects are involved, including Alzheimer disease, autism, bipolar disorder, diabetes, male sexual orientation, obesity, and schizophrenia. We observe that the number, type, and relative orientation of repeated elements flanking a gene are particularly important in predicting whether a gene is imprinted.},

  Volume = {56},

  Pages = {123-136},
  Abstract = {DNA-looping mechanisms are part of networks that regulate all aspects of DNA metabolism, including transcription, replication, and recombination. DNA looping is involved in regulation of transcriptional initiation in prokaryotic operons, including ara, gal, lac, and deo, and in phage systems. Similarly, in eukaryotic organisms, the effects of enhancers appear to be mediated at least in part by loop formation, and examples of DNA looping by hormone receptor proteins and developmental regulatory proteins have been found. In addition, instances of looped structures have been found in replication and in recombination in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. DNA loop formation may have different functions in different cellular contexts; in some cases, the loop itself is requisite for regulation, while in others the increase in the effective local concentration of protein may account for the effects observed. The ability of DNA to form loops is affected by the distance between binding sites; by the DNA sequence, which determines deformability and bendability; and by the presence of other proteins that exert an influence on the conformation of a particular sequence. Alteration of the stability of DNA loops and/or protein-DNA binding by extra- or intracellular signals provides responsivity to changing metabolic or environmental conditions. The fundamental property of site-specific protein binding to DNA can be combined with protein-protein and protein-ligand interaction to generate a broad range of physiological states.},

  Journal = {Journal of Molecular Biology},
  Volume = {314},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {23-40},
  Abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including water and counterions are reported on five examples of A-tract DNA oligonucleotide dodecamer duplexes for which crystal structures are available, the homopolymeric duplex sequences poly(dA) and poly(dG), and two related sequences that serve as controls. MD was performed using the AMBER suite of programs for 3 ns on each sequence. These results, combined with previously reported MDs on 25-mer and 30-mer oligonucleotides on sequences with phased A-tracts carried out under a similar simulation protocol, are used to examine salient issues in the structural chemistry of ApA steps and A-tract induced axis bending. MD modeling sucessfully describes the distinctive B&prime; structure of A-tracts in solution as essentially straight (wedge angles of B-form DNA, with slight base-pair inclination, high propeller twist and a minor groove narrowing 5&prime; to 3&prime;. The MD structures in solution agree closely with corresponding crystal structures, supporting the idea that crystal structures provide a good model for A-tract DNA structure in solution. From the collective MD results, bending and flexibility are calculated by step. Pyrimidine-purine steps are predicted to be most intrinsically bent and also most bendable, i.e. susceptible to bending. Pyrimidine-pyrimidine (~ purine-purine) and purine-pyrimidine steps show less intrinsic deformation and deformability. The MD calculated flexibility correlates well with the protein-induced bendability derived independently from the protein DNA crystal structures. The MD results indicate that bending and flexibility of base-pair steps in DNA are highly correlated, i.e. steps that exhibit the most intrinsic deformation from B-form DNA turn are also the most dynamically deformable. The MD description of A-tract-induced axis bending shows most consistency with the non A-tract, general-sequence model, in which the sequence curvature originates primarily in base-pair roll towards the major groove in non-A-tract regions of the sequence, particularly pyrimidine-purine steps. The direction of curvature is towards the minor groove viewed from opposite the A-tracts, but the A-tracts per se exhibit only minor deformation. The MD results are found to be consistent with the directionality of bending inferred for DNA sequences from gel retardation and cyclization experiments.},

abstract = {Most of the human genome encodes neither protein nor known functional RNA, yet available approaches to seek meaningful information in the "noncoding" sequence are limited. The unique biology of the X chromosome, one of which is silenced in mammalian females, can yield clues into sequence motifs involved in chromosome packaging and function. Although autosomal chromatin has some capacity for inactivation, evidence indicates that sequences enriched on the X chromosome render it fully competent for silencing, except in specific regions that escape inactivation. Here we have used a linguistic approach by analyzing the frequency and distribution of nine base-pair genomic "words" throughout the human genome. Results identify previously unknown sequence differences on the human X chromosome. Notably, the dinucleotide repeats [AT]n, [AC]n, and [AG]n are significantly enriched across the X chromosome compared with autosomes. Moreover, a striking enrichment (>10-fold) of [GATA]n is revealed throughout the 10-Mb segment at Xp22 that escapes inactivation, and is confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A similar enrichment is found in other eutherian genomes. Our findings clearly demonstrate sequence differences relevant to the novel biology and evolution of the X chromosome. Furthermore, they implicate simple sequence repeats, linked to gene regulation and unusual DNA structures, in the regulation and formation of facultative heterochromatin. Results suggest a new paradigm whereby a regional escape from X inactivation is due to the presence of elements that prevent heterochromatinization, rather than the lack of other elements that promote it.

  Abstract = {Motivation: In the living cell nucleus, genomic DNA is packaged into DNA sequences that regulate transcription and other chromosomal processes are associated with local disruptions, or openings', in chromatin structure caused by the cooperative action of regulatory proteins. Such perturbations are extremely specific for cis-regulatory elements and occur over short stretches of DNA (typically [~]250 bp). They can be detected experimentally as DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) in vivo, though the process is extremely laborious and costly. The ability to discriminate DNaseI HSs computationally would have a major impact on the annotation and utilization of the human genome. Results: We found that a supervised pattern recognition algorithm, trained using a set of 280 DNaseI HS and 737 non-HS control sequences from erythroid cells, was capable of de novo prediction of HSs across the human genome with surprisingly high accuracy determined by prospective in vivo validation. Systematic application of this computational approach will greatly facilitate the discovery and analysis of functional non-coding elements in the human and other complex genomes.

By using a virtual bond to model the constraints imposed by the sugar-phosphate backbone, twist, roll, tilt and rise can be simultaneously optimised for any given values of slide and shift. Thus we have been able to construct complete conformational maps for all step types. For some steps, the maps agree well with experimental data from X-ray crystal structures, but other steps appear to be strongly perturbed by the effects of context (conformational coupling with the neighbouring steps). The optimised values of twist and roll show sequence-dependent variations consistent with the crystal structure data. The conformational maps allow us to construct adiabatic paths, and hence calculate the flexibility of each step with respect to slide and shift. Again the results agree well with the available experimental assignments of flexibility: YR steps, CA/TG and CG, are the most flexible and RR steps, such as AA, the least flexible.},

  Journal = {Journal of Molecular Biology},
  Volume = {295},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {85-103},
  Abstract = {A database of X-ray crystal structures of double helical DNA oligomers has been used to analyse the role of the sugar-phosphate backbone in coupling the conformational properties of neighbouring dinucleotide steps. The base step parameters which are most strongly coupled to the backbone degrees of freedom are slide and shift, and these are the two dinucleotide step parameters which show strong correlations along a sequence: the value of slide follows the values in the neighbouring steps, whereas shift tends to alternate. This conformational coupling is mediated by the shared furanose rings at the step junctions: a change in the value of slide causes a change in the mean value of the same strand 3&prime; and 5&prime;-[chi] torsion angle, and a change in the mean value of the 3&prime; and 5&prime; sugar pseudo-rotation phase angle, P; a change in the value of shift causes a difference between the same strand 3&prime; and 5&prime;-[chi] in A-DNA and a difference between the 3&prime; and 5&prime;-P in B-DNA. We have used a database of tetranucleotide X-ray crystal structures to parameterise a simple model for the coupling of slide and shift. Using this junction model together with our dinucleotide step potential energy maps described previously, we can in principle calculate the structure of any DNA oligomer. The parameterisation indicates that the rotational step parameters are accurate to within 5 [deg], and the translational step parameters are accurate to within 0.5 A. The model has been used to study the potential energy surfaces of all possible tetranucleotide sequences, and the calculations agree well with the experimental data from X-ray crystal structures. Some dinucleotide steps are context independent (AA/TT, AT and TA), because the conformational properties of all possible neighbouring steps are compatible. When the conformational properties of the neighbours are not compatible, the behaviour of a step cannot be understood at the dinucleotide level. Thus the conformations of CG, GC and GG/CC are all strongly context dependent. The remaining mixed sequence steps show weakly context-dependent behaviour. The approach allows the calculation of the relative stability and flexibility of tetranucleotide sequences, and the results indicate why TATA is used as an origin of replication. Clear predictions are made about sequences which have not yet been characterised crystallographically. In particular, poly(CCA)[middle dot]poly(TGG) is predicted to have an unusual structure which lies between the C and D-DNA polymorphs.},

  Pages = {981-988},
  Abstract = {Motivation: Classification is an important data mining task in biomedicine. In particular, classification on biomedical data often claims the separation of pathological and healthy samples with highest discriminatory performance for diagnostic issues. Even more important than the overall accuracy is the balance of a classifier, particularly if datasets of unbalanced class size are examined. Results: We present a novel instance-based classification technique which takes both information of different local density of data objects and local cluster structures into account. Our method, which adopts the basic ideas of density-based outlier detection, determines the local point density in the neighborhood of an object to be classified and of all clusters in the corresponding region. A data object is assigned to that class where it fits best into the local cluster structure. The experimental evaluation on biomedical data demonstrates that our approach outperforms most popular classification methods.

  Title = {Prediction of regulatory networks: genome-wide identification of transcription factor targets from gene expression data},
  Journal = {Bioinformatics},
  Volume = {19},
  Number = {15},
  Pages = {1917-1926},
  Abstract = {Motivation: Defining regulatory networks, linking transcription factors (TFs) to their targets, is a central problem in post-genomic biology. One might imagine one could readily determine these networks through inspection of gene expression data. However, the relationship between the expression timecourse of a transcription factor and its target is not obvious (e.g. simple correlation over the timecourse), and current analysis methods, such as hierarchical clustering, have not been very successful in deciphering them. Results: Here we introduce an approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) to predict the targets of a transcription factor by identifying subtle relationships between their expression profiles. In particular, we used SVMs to predict the regulatory targets for 36 transcription factors in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome based on the microarray expression data from many different physiological conditions. We trained and tested our SVM on a data set constructed to include a significant number of both positive and negative examples, directly addressing data imbalance issues. This was non-trivial given that most of the known experimental information is only for positives. Overall, we found that 63\$\%\$ of our TF-target relationships were confirmed through cross-validation. We further assessed the performance of our regulatory network identifications by comparing them with the results from two recent genome-wide ChIP-chip experiments. Overall, we find the agreement between our results and these experiments is comparable to the agreement (albeit low) between the two experiments. We find that this network has a delocalized structure with respect to chromosomal positioning, with a given transcription factor having targets spread fairly uniformly across the genome. Availability: The overall network of the relationships is available on the web at http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/expression/echipchip},

  Journal = {PLoS Biology},
  Volume = {2},

  Abstract = {The Human Epigenome Project aims to identify, catalogue, and interpret genome-wide DNA methylation phenomena. Occurring naturally on cytosine bases at cytosine&\#8211;guanine dinucleotides, DNA methylation is intimately involved in diverse biological processes and the aetiology of many diseases. Differentially methylated cytosines give rise to distinct profiles, thought to be specific for gene activity, tissue type, and disease state. The identification of such methylation variable positions will significantly improve our understanding of genome biology and our ability to diagnose disease. Here, we report the results of the pilot study for the Human Epigenome Project entailing the methylation analysis of the human major histocompatibility complex. This study involved the development of an integrated pipeline for high-throughput methylation analysis using bisulphite DNA sequencing, discovery of methylation variable positions, epigenotyping by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry, and development of an integrated public database available at http://www.epigenome.org. Our analysis of DNA methylation levels within the major histocompatibility complex, including regulatory exonic and intronic regions associated with 90 genes in multiple tissues and individuals, reveals a bimodal distribution of methylation profiles (i.e., the vast majority of the analysed regions were either hypo- or hypermethylated), tissue specificity, inter-individual variation, and correlation with independent gene expression data. },

  Abstract = {A significant fraction of Alu repeats in human sperm DNA, previously found to be unmethylated, is nearly completely methylated in DNA from many somatic tissues. A similar fraction of unmethylated Alus is observed here in sperm DNA from rhesus monkey. However, Alus are almost completely methylated at the restriction sites tested in monkey follicular oocyte DNA. The Alu methylation patterns in mature male and female monkey germ cells are consistent with Alu methylation in human germ cell tumors. Alu sequences are hypomethylated in seminoma DNAs and more methylated in a human ovarian dysgerminoma. These results contrast with methylation patterns reported for germ cell single-copy, CpG island, satellite, and L1 sequences. The function of Alu repeats is not known, but differential methylation of Alu repeats in the male and female germ lines suggests that they may serve as markers for genomic imprinting or in maintaining differences in male and female meiosis.},

  Abstract = {We investigated the CpG methylation of 19 specific members of Alu sub-families in human DNA isolated from whole blood, using an assay based on methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion of genomic DNA and hot-stop' polymerase chain reaction. We found significant interindividual variability in the level of methylation for specific Alu elements among the members of 48 three-generation families. Surprisingly, some of the elements also displayed quantitative parent of origin methylation differences; i.e. the mean level of methylation differed significantly when the insertions were transmitted through paternal versus maternal meiosis. Bisulfite sequence analysis of individual elements at such loci suggests, further, that maternal and paternal elements differ in the propensity of particular CpG sites to become unmethylated. Some individuals who exhibited high levels of methylation at specific Alu elements came from families in which more than one member also exhibited abnormal patterns of methylation at the differentially methylated regions of the IGF2/H19 or IGF2R loci, suggesting that there may be heritable differences between individuals in the fidelity with which allelic DNA methylation differences are established or maintained. Quantitative parental origin differences in methylation were identified only for Alu elements that lie in sub-telomeric or sub-centromeric bands of human chromosomes, whereas those assayed at intermediate positions did not exhibit any significant differences. The centromere/telomere restricted location of the methylation differences and the fact that none of these differences occur in regions of chromosomes known to contain transcriptionally imprinted genes suggest that maternal/paternal epigenetic modifications may play additional roles in processes other than transcriptional control.},

  Journal = {Journal of Molecular Biology},
  Volume = {343},
  Number = {4},
  Pages = {891-901},
  Abstract = {DNA sequences contain information about the bendability and native conformation of DNA. For example, a repetition of certain dinucleotides at distances of 10-11 bp supports wrapping around nucleosomes and supercoiled structures of bacterial DNA. We analyzed 86 eubacterial genomes, 16 archaea, and six genomes of higher eukaryotes. First, we discuss whether or not the observed periodicities represent indeed bendability signals. This claim is confirmed since: (1) dinucleotide signals are of comparable size to mononucleotide signals, (2) the signals are present in non-coding DNA as well, and (3) repeat masking has only a minor effect on 10-11 bp periodicities. Moreover, the periodicities persist up to 150 bp, comparable to the nucleosome size. We show that doublet peaks in Caenorhabditis elegans and some prokaryotes can be traced back to long-ranging modulations. In mammalian genomes, we find consistently spectral peaks as observed earlier in human chromosomes 20, 21 and 22. It has been shown in previous studies that archaea have periods of 10 bp, whereas eubacteria exhibit 11 bp periodicities. These differences reflect different supercoiled states of microbial DNA. Is the period of 10 bp an archaeal or a thermophilic feature? This question is addressed by relating periodicities to optimal growth temperatures. It turns out that the archaea Methanopyrus kandleri (topt=80 [deg]C) and a Halobacterium strain (topt=42 [deg]C) both have longer periods of about 11 bp. Eubacterial genomes have consistently periods around 11 bp indicative of negative supercoiling.},

   Abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is curable in less than 50 $\%$ of patients. Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI), are currently used to predict outcome in DLBCL. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70 $\%$ versus 12$\%$). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific IPI risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in DLBCL outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in DLBCL and identify rational targets for intervention.},

  Journal = {Bioinformatics},
  Volume = {20},

  Pages = {1896-1904},
  Abstract = {Motivation: Aberrant DNA methylation is common in cancer. DNA methylation profiles differ between tumor types and subtypes and provide a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying clusters of samples and/or genes. DNA methylation data obtained with the quantitative, highly sensitive MethyLight technology is not normally distributed; it frequently contains an excess of zeros. Established tools to analyze this type of data do not exist. Here, we evaluate a variety of methods for cluster analysis to determine which is most reliable. Results: We introduce a Bernoulli-lognormal mixture model for clustering DNA methylation data obtained using MethyLight. We model the outcomes using a two-part distribution having discrete and continuous components. It is compared with standard cluster analysis approaches for continuous data and for discrete data. In a simulation study, we find that the two-part model has the lowest classification error rate for mixture outcome data compared with other approaches. The methods are illustrated using DNA methylation data from a study of lung cancer cell lines. Compared with competing hierarchical clustering methods, the mixture model approaches have the lowest cross-validation error for detecting lung cancer subtype (non-small versus small cell). The Bernoulli-lognormal mixture assigns observations to subgroups with the lowest uncertainty. Availability: Software is available upon request from the authors.

  Journal = {PNAS},
  Volume = {99},
  Number = {6},
  Pages = {3740-3745},
  Abstract = {CpG islands are useful markers for genes in organisms containing 5-methylcytosine in their genomes. In addition, CpG islands located in the promoter regions of genes can play important roles in gene silencing during processes such as X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting, and silencing of intragenomic parasites. The generally accepted definition of what constitutes a CpG island was proposed in 1987 by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer [Gardiner-Garden, M. & Frommer, M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 261-282] as being a 200-bp stretch of DNA with a C+G content of 50\$\%\$ and an observed CpG/expected CpG in excess of 0.6. Any definition of a CpG island is somewhat arbitrary, and this one, which was derived before the sequencing of mammalian genomes, will include many sequences that are not necessarily associated with controlling regions of genes but rather are associated with intragenomic parasites. We have therefore used the complete genomic sequences of human chromosomes 21 and 22 to examine the properties of CpG islands in different sequence classes by using a search algorithm that we have developed. Regions of DNA of greater than 500 bp with a G+C equal to or greater than 55\$\%\$ and observed CpG/expected CpG of 0.65 were more likely to be associated with the 5' regions of genes and this definition excluded most Alu-repetitive elements. We also used genome sequences to show strong CpG suppression in the human genome and slight suppression in Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This finding is compatible with the recent detection of 5-methylcytosine in Drosophila, and might suggest that S. cerevisiae has, or once had, CpG methylation.},

  Abstract = {It is shown that in the genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates the elevation of genic GC-content is associated with an increase in the bendability of the DNA helix, which is both absolute and relative as compared with random sequences. This trend takes place both in exons and introns, being more pronounced in the latter. At the same time, the free energy of melting (delta G) of exons and introns increases only absolutely with elevation of GC-content, whereas it decreases as compared with random sequences (again, this trend is stronger in the introns). In genes of cold-blooded animals, plants, and unicellular organisms, these regularities are weaker and often not consistent. Generally, there is a negative correlation between bendability and melting energy at any fixed GC-content value. This effect is stronger in the introns. These findings suggest that GC-enrichment of genes in the homeotherm vertebrates can be caused by selection for increased bendability of DNA.},

  Abstract = {A new explanation for the emergence of heavy (GC-rich) isochores is proposed, based on the study of thermostability, bendability, ability to B-Z transition and curvature of the DNA helix. The absolute values of thermostability, bendability and ability to B-Z transition correlated positively with GC content, whereas curvature correlated negatively. The relative values of these parameters were determined as compared to randomized sequences. In genes and intergenic spacers of warm-blooded animals, both the relative bendability and ability to B-Z transition increased with elevation of GC content, whereas the relative thermostability and curvature decreased. The usage of synonymous codons in GC-rich genes was also found to augment bendability and ability to B-Z transition and to reduce thermostability of DNA (as compared to synonymous codons with the same GC content). The analysis of transposable elements (Alu and B2 repeats in the human and mouse) showed that the level of their divergence from the consensus sequence positively correlated with relative bendability and ability to B-Z transition and negatively with relative thermostability. The bendability and ability to B-Z transition are known to relate to open chromatin and active transcription, whereas curvature facilitates chromatin condensation. Because heavy isochores are known to be gene-rich and show a high level of transcription, it is suggested here that isochores arose not as an adaptation to elevated temperature but because of a certain grade of general organization and correspondingly advanced level of genomic organization, reflected in genome structuring, with physical properties of DNA in the gene-rich regions being optimized for active transcription and in the gene-poor regions for chromatin condensation ( transcription/grade' concept).},

  Abstract = {The rotational and translational positioning of nucleosomes on DNA is dependent to a significant extent on the physicochemical properties of the double helix. We have investigated the influence of the axial flexibility of the molecule on the affinity for the histone octamer by substituting selected DNA sequences with either inosine for guanosine or diaminopurine for adenine. These substitutions, respectively, remove or add a purine 2-amino group exposed in the minor groove and, respectively, decrease and increase the apparent persistence length. We observe that for all sequences tested inosine substitution, with one exception, increases the affinity for histone binding. Conversely diaminopurine substitution decreases the affinity. In the sole example where replacement of guanosine with inosine decreases the persistence length as well as the affinity for histones, the substitution concomitantly removes an intrinsic curvature of the DNA molecule. We show that, to a first approximation, the binding energy of DNA to histones at 1 M NaCl is directly proportional to the persistence length. The data also indicate that a high local flexibility of DNA can favour strong rotational positioning.},

  Abstract = {Purpose: Aberrant DNA methylation, now recognized as a contributing factor to neoplasia, often shows definitive gene/sequence preferences unique to specific cancer types. Correspondingly, distinct combinations of methylated loci can function as biomarkers for numerous clinical correlates of ovarian and other cancers. Experimental Design: We used a microarray approach to identify methylated loci prognostic for reduced progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced ovarian cancer patients. Two data set classification algorithms, Significance Analysis of Microarray and Prediction Analysis of Microarray, successfully identified 220 candidate PFS-discriminatory methylated loci. Of those, 112 were found capable of predicting PFS with 95\$\%\$ accuracy, by Prediction Analysis of Microarray, using an independent set of 40 advanced ovarian tumors (from 20 short-PFS and 20 long-PFS patients, respectively). Additionally, we showed the use of these predictive loci using two bioinformatics machine-learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron. Conclusion: In this report, we show that highly prognostic DNA methylation biomarkers can be successfully identified and characterized, using previously unused, rigorous classifying algorithms. Such ovarian cancer biomarkers represent a promising approach for the assessment and management of this devastating disease.},

  Abstract = {Motivation: In drug discovery a key task is to identify characteristics that separate active (binding) compounds from inactive (non-binding) ones. An automated prediction system can help reduce resources necessary to carry out this task. Results: Two methods for prediction of molecular bioactivity for drug design are introduced and shown to perform well in a data set previously studied as part of the KDD (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) Cup 2001. The data is characterized by very few positive examples, a very large number of features (describing three-dimensional properties of the molecules) and rather different distributions between training and test data. Two techniques are introduced specifically to tackle these problems: a feature selection method for unbalanced data and a classifier which adapts to the distribution of the the unlabeled test data (a so-called transductive method). We show both techniques improve identification performance and in conjunction provide an improvement over using only one of the techniques. Our results suggest the importance of taking into account the characteristics in this data which may also be relevant in other problems of a similar type.

  Volume = {64},
  Number = {13},
  Pages = {4472-4480},
  Abstract = {Hypomethylation of some portions of the genome and hypermethylation of others are very frequent in human cancer. The hypomethylation often involves satellite 2 (Sat2) DNA in the juxtacentromeric (centromere-adjacent) region of chromosome 1. In this study, we analyzed methylation in centromeric and juxtacentromeric satellite DNA in 115 ovarian cancers, 26 non-neoplastic ovarian specimens, and various normal somatic tissue standards. We found that hypomethylation of both types of satellite DNA in ovarian samples increased significantly from non-neoplastic toward cancer tissue. Furthermore, strong hypomethylation was significantly more prevalent in tumors of advanced stage or high grade. Importantly, extensive hypomethylation of Sat2 DNA in chromosome 1 was a highly significant marker of poor prognosis (relative risk for relapse, 4.1, and death, 9.4) and more informative than tumor grade or stage. Also, comparing methylation of satellite DNA and 15 5' gene regions, which are often hypermethylated in cancer or implicated in ovarian carcinogenesis, we generally found no positive or negative association between methylation changes in satellite DNA and in the gene regions. However, hypermethylation at two loci, CDH13 (at 16q24) and RNR1 (at 13p12), was correlated strongly with lower levels of Sat2 hypomethylation. The CDH13/Sat2 epigenetic correlation was seen also in breast cancers. We conclude that satellite DNA hypomethylation is an important issue in ovarian carcinogenesis as demonstrated by: (a) an increase from non-neoplastic tissue toward ovarian cancer; (b) an increase within the ovarian cancer group toward advanced grade and stage; and (c) the finding that strong hypomethylation was an independent marker of poor prognosis.},

  Title = {KBA: kernel boundary alignment considering imbalanced data distribution},
  Journal = {Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on},
  Volume = {17},
  Number = {6},
  Pages = {786-795},
  Abstract = {An imbalanced training data set can pose serious problems for many real-world data mining tasks that employ SVMs to conduct supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a kernel-boundary-alignment algorithm, which considers THE training data imbalance as prior information to augment SVMs to improve class-prediction accuracy. Using a simple example, we first show that SVMs can suffer from high incidences of false negatives when the training instances of the target class are heavily outnumbered by the training instances of a nontarget class. The remedy we propose is to adjust the class boundary by modifying the kernel matrix, according to the imbalanced data distribution. Through theoretical analysis backed by empirical study, we show that our kernel-boundary-alignment algorithm works effectively on several data sets.},

  Title = {Alu Element Mutation Spectra: Molecular Clocks and the Effect of {DNA} Methylation},
  Journal = {Journal of Molecular Biology},
  Volume = {344},
  Number = {3},
  Pages = {675-682},
  Abstract = {In primate genomes more than 40\$\%\$ of CpG islands are found within repetitive elements. With more than one million copies in the human genome, the Alu family of retrotransposons represents the most successful short interspersed element (SINE) in primates and CpG dinucleotides make up about 20\$\%\$ of Alu sequences. It is generally thought that CpG dinucleotides mutate approximately ten times faster than other dinucleotides due to cytosine methylation and the subsequent deamination and conversion of C-->T. However, the disparity of Alu subfamily age estimations based upon CpG or non-CpG substitution density indicates a more complex relationship between CpG and non-CpG substitutions within the Alu elements. Here we report an analysis of the mutation patterns for 5296 Alu elements comprising 20 subfamilies. Our results indicate a relatively constant CpG versus non-CpG substitution ratio of \~6 for the young (AluY) and intermediate (AluS) Alu subfamilies. However, a more complex non-linear relationship between CpG and non-CpG substitutions was observed when old (AluJ) subfamilies were included in the analysis. These patterns may be the result of the slowdown of the neutral mutation rate during primate evolution and/or an increase in the CpG mutation rate as the consequence of increased DNA methylation in response to a burst of retrotransposition activity \~35 million years ago.},

  Title = {A Comprehensive Analysis of Allelic Methylation Status of CpG Islands on Human Chromosome 21q},
  Journal = {Genome Res.},
  Volume = {14},
  Number = {2},
  Pages = {247-266},
  Abstract = {Approximately half of all human genes have CpG islands (CGIs)around their promoter regions. Although CGIs usually escape methylation, those on Chromosome X in females and those in the vicinity of imprinted genes are exceptions: They have both methylated and unmethylated alleles to display a composite pattern in methylation analysis. In addition, aberrant methylation of CGIs is known to often occur in cancer cells. Here we developed a simple HpaII-McrBC PCR method for discrimination of full, null, incomplete, and composite methylation patterns, and applied it to all computationally identified CGIs on human Chromosome 21q. This comprehensive analysis revealed that, although most CGIs (103 out of 149)escape methylation, a sizable fraction (31 out of 149)are fully methylated even in normal peripheral blood cells. Furthermore, we identified seven CGIs showing the composite methylation, and demonstrated that three of them are indeed methylated monoallelically. Further analyses using informative pedigrees revealed that two of the three are subject to maternal allele-specific methylation. Intriguingly, the other CGI is methylated in an allele-specific but parental-origin-independent manner. Thus, the cell seems to have a broader repertoire of methylating CGIs than previously thought, and our approach may contribute to uncover novel modes of allelic methylation.},

  Title = {Computation method to identify differential allelic gene expression and novel imprinted genes},
  Journal = {Bioinformatics},
  Volume = {19},
  Number = {8},
  Pages = {952-955},
  Abstract = {Motivation: Genomic imprinting plays an important role in both normal development and diseases. Abnormal imprinting is strongly associated with several human diseases including cancers. Most of the imprinted genes were discovered in the neighborhood of the known imprinted genes. This approach is difficult to extend to analyze the whole genome. We have decided to take a computational approach to systematically search the whole genome for the presence of mono-allelic expressed genes and imprinted genes in human genome. Results: A computational method was developed to identify novel imprinted or mono-allelic genes. Individuals represented in human cDNA libraries were genotyped using Bayesian statistics, and differential expression of polymorphic alleles was identified. A significant reduction in the number of libraries that expressed both alleles, measured by Z-statistics, is a strong indicator for an imprinted or a mono-allelic gene.

  Journal = {PNAS},
  Volume = {102},
  Number = {8},
  Pages = {2850-2855},
  Abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing affects a majority of human genes and plays important roles in development and disease. Alternative splicing (AS) events conserved since the divergence of human and mouse are likely of primary biological importance, but relatively few of such events are known. Here we describe sequence features that distinguish exons subject to evolutionarily conserved AS, which we call alternative conserved exons (ACEs), from other orthologous human/mouse exons and integrate these features into an exon classification algorithm, ACESCAN. Genome-wide analysis of annotated orthologous human-mouse exon pairs identified {approx}2,000 predicted ACEs. Alternative splicing was verified in both human and mouse tissues by using an RT-PCR-sequencing protocol for 21 of 30 (70\$\%\$) predicted ACEs tested, supporting the validity of a majority of ACESCAN predictions. By contrast, AS was observed in mouse tissues for only 2 of 15 (13\$\%\$) tested exons that had EST or cDNA evidence of AS in human but were not predicted ACEs, and AS was never observed for 11 negative control exons in human or mouse tissues. Predicted ACEs were much more likely to preserve the reading frame and less likely to disrupt protein domains than other AS events and were enriched in genes expressed in the brain and in genes involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and development. Our results also imply that the vast majority of AS events represented in the human EST database are not conserved in mouse.},
