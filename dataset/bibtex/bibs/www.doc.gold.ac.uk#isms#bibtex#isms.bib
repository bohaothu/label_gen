	ABSTRACT   	= {How do teachers and researchers assess creativity in composing music? Four approaches can be used: assessing 1) Product, 2) Process, 3) Person, and 4) Environment. The purpose of the study was: 1) to give an overview of research studies in each of the four approaches, and 2) to suggest a Product-oriented method for assessing creativity in composing music and story-telling by children, which was successfully used with high interjudge reliabilties in Auh & Johnston (2000). The overview should give a clear picture of assessment methods for creativity in composing music. The overview shows that: 1) Product - A most commonly used method for assessing music compositions is expert judges' evaluations using criteria. Computerized content analysis has been used for Western classical masterpieces. 2) Process - Compositional strategies used by Expert vs. novice can be described as Gestaltistic vs. Atomistic. 3) Person - Visual imagery stimulated by use of graphic notations in composing music made a significant difference in musical creativity, producing more creative compositions. 4) Environment - Creativity in the East versus the West can be described as intuition vs. logic. Cross-cultural studies of musical creativity show that musicians of non-western countries emphasize aural skills, improvisation, and opportunity to exercise creative potentials.},

	VOLUME	    = {3},
	NUMBER	    = {1},
	PAGES	    = {3-19},
	ABSTRACT   = {The concept of "grammar" is at the basis both of
             listening to and of composing music. Music grammar
             includes morphology and syntax, the former being defined
             as the identification of different categories of musical
             structures, the latter as that of rules connecting
             morphological unities. In listening to music morphology
             corresponds to "categorical" perception and syntax to
             "structural" perception. In composing and in music
             analysis, the intuitive procedures of perception must be
             transformed into explicitly rational knowledge:
             morphology corresponds to a clear definition of musical
             concepts and syntax to that of musical rules. According
             to the theory, morphology and syntax correspond to actual
             cognitive processes; however a distinction is made
             between a grammar, and its uses, that is, its
             applications in composing and listening activities. Some
             critical remarks on this point are made in respect of the
             tradition of cognitive studies. A further aspect of
             grammar is then underlined: the distintion between
             syntactic and semantic rules. The aim of both of these is
             to build expressive structures which can be undestood and
             interpreted by means of socially legitimated hermeneutic
             conventions. In this sense grammar is to be conceived of
             not only as a psychic, but also as a social
             instrument. In order to understand the mental procedures
             of composition, all the methods so far proposed risk
             remaining at the surface of the problems to which they
             are applied unless they are integrated into a more
             accurate and adequate consideration of grammatical
             thinking. },

             model of a novice jazz musician learning to

             populations of melodic ideas that are mapped to specific
             notes through scales suggested by the chord progression
             being played. As GenJam plays its solos over the
             accompaniment of a standard rhythm section, a human
             mentor gives real-time feedback, which is used to derive
             fitness values for the individual measures and
             phrases. GenJam then applies various genetic operators to
             the populations to breed improved generations of ideas.},

             quintet. GenJam evolves populations of melodic ideas
             under the guidance of a human mentor, whose feedback
             provides the environment under which individual ideas
             either survive to breed or die off. GenJam also uses its
             genetic algorithm machinery as a real-time melodic
             development paradigm to evolve phrases played by a human
             into its improvised responses in chase choruses. The
             paper provides an overview of the GenJam architecture and
             focuses on interface issues for three classes of users:
             mentors who train GenJam individually, audiences who
             train GenJam collectively, and performers who interact
             with GenJam in real-time performance situations.},

             beginning measure of harmony. Subjects recorded their
             thoughts verbally during the composition process and

	ABSTRACT     = {This thesis develops and evaluates predictive theories
		of music. Good theories should model a particular class of music and
		predict new pieces in the class with high probability. Attention is
		restricted to melody alone -- harmony and polyphony are not
		considered. Theories are constructed using an empirical learning
		approach, and to construct and evaluate them, one hundred Bach
		chorale melodies are analyzed.  Theories are evaluated by a data
		compression measure, which is a strong indicator of their predictive
		power. The entropy of the chorales is estimated by averaging the
		amount of compression given to a test set using a theory learned
		from a training set. The central hypothesis is that the chorales are
		quite redundant in the information theoretic sense. A novel approach
		to the induction of sequence generating rules, called multiple
		viewpoints, is created. This method is based on the variable--order
		Markov model, with extensions to incorporate timescales and parallel
		streams of description. A multiple viewpoint system comprises two
		parts: a long--term theory which adapts to a class of sequences, and
		a short--term theory which adapts to a particular instance of the
		class. Predictions from both are combined into an overall
		prediction. The performance of several different multiple viewpoint
		systems is assessed on the chorale data. The redundancy of the
		chorales is thereby estimated to be 55\%. This thesis concludes that
		the estimate must be compared with human performance at the same
		predictive task. The theory should also be evaluated in terms of the
		quality of the new chorales it generates, and by its ability to
		discriminate chorales from non--chorales.},

             independent views of the musical surface each of which
             models a specific type of musical phenomena. Both the
             general style and a particular piece are modeled using
             dual short-term and long-term theories, and the model is
             created using machine learning techniques on a corpus of
             musical examples. The models are used for analysis and
             prediction, and we conjecture that highly predictive
             theories will also generate original, acceptable,
             works. Although the quality of the works generated is
             hard to quantify objectively, the predictive power of
             models can be measured by the notion of entropy, or
             unpredictability. Highly predictive theories will produce
             low-entropy estimates of a musical language. The methods
             developed are applied to the Bach chorale
             melodies. Multiple-viewpoint systems are learned from a
             sample of 95 chorales, estimates of entropy are produced,
             and a predictive theory is used to generate new, unseen
             pieces. },

	ABSTRACT   = {Research into the bodily basis of musical meaning
             has focused on conceptual metaphor and image 
             schemata, but the processes whereby embodied
             experience becomes relevant to music 
             conceptualization remains largely unexplained. This
             paper offers an account of music conceptualization
             that helps explain how embodied experience motivates
             and constrains the formation of basic musical
             meaning. The core of the "mimetic hypothesis" holds
             that 1) we understand sounds in comparison to sounds
             we have made ourselves, and that 2) this process of
             comparison involves tacit imitation, or mimetic
             participation, which in turn draws on the prior
             embodied experience of sound production. Evidence
             for the hypothesis comes from developmental and
             neuropsychological studies, and from speech imagery,
             motor imagery, and musical imagery studies. The
             embodied experience activated during mimetic 
             participation motivates and constrains the
             cross-domain mappings on which so many musical
             concepts depend. For example, the metaphoric concept
             of musical verticality cannot be accounted for 
             without acknowledging the role of mimetic
             participation. If this participation is as
             fundamental to musical experience as the hypothesis
             suggests, not only will it allow us to account for
             music's most fundamental concepts, but it will also
             help account for the affective features of musical
             experience and meaning. Furthermore, the proposed
             view of mimetic participation helps establish a
             physical grounding for theories of musical gesture,
             semiotics, music and gender, music and drama, aural
             skills pedagogy, music and society, music and dance,
             and music therapy.},

	ABSTRACT   = {In this chapter I shall attempt to offer an alternative
             account of the role of music in human evolution. At the
             outset I must admit that it is in part motivated by a
             personal desire to defend the value of music as a human
             activity - as a musician, the notion of music as
             "parasitic cheesecake" is somewhat unpalatable. But it is
             also motivated by a desire to try to make sense of the
             varieties of music, of the multiplicities of roles that
             music plays in human lives and of the myriad and
             divergent meanings that have been attributed to music. In
             this attempt I shall be putting forward a view of music
             as rooted in human biology and its evolution, but one
             that is not intended to be reductionist or simply
             sociobiological. I shall not be arguing that there is a
             "gene for music", but rather that our musicality is
             grounded in human biology as expressed in the evolution
             and development of our cognitive capacities and of our
             social and environmental interactions. Music is a product
             of, and a process in, our individual development, the
             cultures that enfold our "lifelines"[4] and the evolution
             of our species.},

	ABSTRACT   = {Does the music that we know have a language-like
             semantics? I argue that mere agreement among auditors
             about their cognitive representations and descriptions of
             music doesn't give grounds for attributing meaning to
             music. I also argue that music does not have a
             language-like semantics not because it fails to be
             robustly referential, but because musical structures are
             not genuine grammars. The reason is that while music
             typically has very elaborate and regular structures -
             much like language - these structures do not apparently
             originate from nor are they in the service of the need to
             encode meanings - exactly unlike language. Nonetheless,
             the difference between languages and music is more a
             matter of degree than of kind. In other words, we can
             imagine transforming what we now call music into a
             language; if, by some strange necessity, music were
             pressed into service on a day-to day basis for the
             purposes of comprehension and communication, then it
             could without much trouble become a language. But we
             would very likely no longer regard the strangely
             melodious utterances of such a language to be real music
             once it came to serve, in a quite transparent way, its
             pragmatic communicative and cognitive functions. I
             explain these views as a consequence of an old-fashioned
             aesthetic theory of music cognition as newly formulated
             by Raffman (1993). },

             predicting listeners' similarity ratings. The
             material consisted of 15 melodies representing five
             folk music styles. A multiple regression analysis
             showed that the similarity of frequency-based
             musical properties could account for a moderate
             amount (40\%) of listeners' similarity ratings.
             A slightly better predictive rate (55\%) was
             achieved by using descriptive variables such as
             number of tones, rhythmic variability, and melodic
             predictability. The results suggest that both
             measures were able to capture some aspects of the
             structures that portray common salient dimensions
             to which listeners pay attention while categorizing
             melodies.},

	ABSTRACT = {Melodic expectations are important in creating patterns
		of tension and relaxation. The way expectations are formed has been
		modeled with tonal hierarchies (Krumhansl &Kessler, 1982)and
		realization of implied intervals (Narmour, 1990). These models have
		been extensively investigated by asking listeners to rate different
		possible melodic continuations. However, these models and
		experimental methods utilize a limited musical context and probe the
		melody at only one point in time. To clarify the role of a more
		extended musical context in expectation formation, a more dynamic
		approach is taken in this study. The aim was to collect continuous
		ratings of melodic predictability from listeners using monophonic
		melodies. The dynamics of the continuous ratings were assessed by
		various models. Listeners rated the predictability of melodies
		simultaneously while the melody is playing. Two sets of melodies were
		used: Experiment 1 contained 40 folk melodies with varying degrees of
		predictability whereas Experiment 2 consisted of 27 artificial
		isochronous sequences. Listeners ?predictability ratings of melodies
		were predicted with three models. Model 1 consisted of Narmour ?s
		implication-realization principles supplemented with tonal stability
		and melodic anchoring. Model 2 was based on recursive probability
		distributions of two-tone continuations where the initial
		probabilities were derived from a large corpus of folk
		melodies. Model 3 comprised the entropy of the distribution of the
		tones within a moving window. Additionally, the applicability of an
		initial key-finding algorithm in the models was investigated. It was
		found that continuous rating of melodies provides relevant
		information of dynamic musical processes. Dynamic models supplement
		the existing models of melodic expectations by extending their
		context sensitivity. The limitations and advantages of the continuous
		rating methodology and dynamic models are discussed. }

	ABSTRACT   = {Music is regarded in biological terms as originating in
             the brain, so that most explanations concentrate on the
             ways in which brains process information. Recent studies
             of the nonlinear dynamics of the primary sensory cortices
             have shown that the patterns that are constructed by
             chaotic nonlinear dynamics in cortical neuropil replace
             stimulus driven activity. This finding supports the
             concept that knowledge in brains is entirely constructed
             within them without direct transfer of information from
             outside. As knowledge increases by learning, brains of
             individuals grow progressively apart. The separation
             results from the uniqueness of the knowledge that is
             constructed within each brain. The resulting condition of
             isolation is known among philosophers as epistemological
             solipsism. This view is reinforced by the tenets of
             aesthetics, which emphasize the deeply personal
             experiences of individuals, not as active listeners but
             as passive recipients of beauty in music and other
             arts. Neither conventional neuroscience nor aesthetics
             can explain the deep emotional power of music to move
             humans to action. An alternative view is presented, in
             which human brains are seen to have evolved primarily in
             response to environmental pressures to bridge the
             solipsistic gulf between individuals, and to form
             integrated societies. An evolutionary origin is found in
             the neurohumoral mechanisms of parental bonding to
             altricial infants. A case is made that music together
             with dance have co-evolved biologically and culturally to
             serve as a technology of social bonding. Findings of
             anthropologists and psychiatrists are reviewed to show
             how the rhythmic behavioral activities that are induced
             by drum beats and music can lead to altered states of
             consciousness, through which mutual trust among members
             of societies is engendered.},

	ABSTRACT   = {Like the information patterns that evolve through
             biological processes, mental representations, or
             memes, evolve through adaptive exploration and
             transformation of an information space through
             variation, selection, and transmission. Since
             unlike genes, memes do not come packaged with
             instructions for their replication, our brains do it
             for them, strategically, guided by a fitness
             landscape that reflects both internal drives and a
             worldview that is continually updated through meme
             assimilation. This paper presents a model for how
             an individual becomes a meme-evolving agent via the
             emergence of an autocatalytic network of sparse,
             distributed memories, and discusses implications for
             complex, creative thought processes and why they are
             unique to humans. Memetics can do more than account
             for the spread of catchy tunes; it can pave the way
             for the kind of overarching framework for the
             humanities that the first form of evolution has
             provided for the biological sciences.},

             set of neural networks are used to capture the conceptual
             ideas that build 'good' music and this knowledge is then
             used to direct a search for the ultimate

		Although this tendency is often attributed to listeners'

		tessitura, and from those extremes a melody has little choice but to
		retreat by changing direction. Statistical analyses of vocal melodies
		from four different continents are consistent with this simple
		explanation. The results suggest that, in the sampled repertories,
		patterns such as "gap- fill," "registral direction," and "registral
		return" (Meyer, 1956, 1973; Narmour, 1990) are mere side effects of

             and as such it incorporates metacognitive, motivational
             and self-regulation components. We therefore
             conceptualise creativity as emerging from a notion of
             expertise grounded in more sophisticated accounts of
             cognition and content. The distinguishing feature of the
             expert is their ability to creatively solve problems. On
             the basis of this account, composition is seen as
             evidence for an increasing level of expertise which
             involves increasing levels of abstraction in the
             cognitive base and consequent sophistication in the
             strategic way that composers engage in the composition
             process. The paper then critically reviews existing
             account of musical creativity from the stand point of the
             need to incorporate underlying cognitive basis to
             creative musical activity. This is demonstrated through

	ABSTRACT   = {The memetic paradigm is herein applied to music.
             While memetics has been used to elucidate a wide
             variety of cultural phenomena, its concerns to date
             have largely been with memes in the realm of
             verbally-expressible concepts. In view of this, this
             paper represents an attempt to integrate the central
             concerns of analytical musicology with a
             neo-Darwinian meme-selectionist perspective. Such a
             viewpoint may be used, it is argued, to unify, under
             a systematic new paradigm, understanding of both
             local issues of musical structure and organization,
             and global issues of musical style configuration and
             its diachronic change. Against the grain of several
             suggestions in the memetics literature, a minimalist
             view of the musical meme is taken, seeing it as
             consisting, at the lower extreme, of configurations
             of as few as three or four notes. The hierarchic
             location of musical memes is a central concern here,
             both in cultural hierarchies - i.e., the replication
             of patterning at different strata within a culture -
             and in structural hierarchies - i.e., the
             replication of patterning at different strata within
             a work, including the level of the global structural
             archetype. Leonard Meyer's perspective on culture is
             employed to frame consideration of the first
             phenomenon, whilst the analytical method of Heinrich
             Schenker is employed to comprehend the second. In
             order to understand how musical memes partake of
             meaning in association with verbally-mediated
             concept memes, the semiology of Ferdinand de
             Saussure and Jean-Jacques Nattiez is employed. The
             article concludes with observations on the
             transmission and mutation of musical memes, and an
             account of how this process engenders the evolution
             of musical styles.},

	ABSTRACT   = { In this paper we present the GP-Music System, an
             interactive system which allows users to evolve short
             musical sequences using interactive genetic programming,
             and its extensions aimed at making the system fully
             automated. The basic GP-system works by using a genetic
             programming algorithm, a small set of functions for
             creating musical sequences, and a user interface which
             allows the user to rate individual sequences. With this
             user interactive technique it was possible to generate
             pleasant tunes over runs of 20 individuals over 10
             generations. As the user is the bottleneck in interactive
             systems, the system takes rating data from a users run
             and uses it to train a neural network based automatic
             rater, or "auto rater", which can replace the user in
             bigger runs. Using this auto rater we were able to make
             runs of up to 50 generations with 500 individuals per
             generation. The best of run pieces generated by the auto
             raters were pleasant but were not, in general, as nice as
             those generated in user interactive runs. },

	ABSTRACT = {This article is a study of melodic expectancy in North
		Sami yoiks, a style of music quite distinct from Western tonal
		music. Three different approaches were taken. The first approach was
		a statistical style analysis of tones in a representative corpus of
		18 yoiks. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone
		onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. It also identified style
		characteristics, such as pentatonic orientation, the presence of two
		reference pitches, the frequency of large consonant intervals, and a
		relatively large set of possible melodic continuations. The second
		approach was a behavioral experiment in which listeners made
		judgments about melodic continuations. Three groups of listeners
		participated. One group was from the Sami culture, the second group
		consisted of Finnish music students who had learned some yoiks, and
		the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar with
		yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations
		(for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on
		general style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks
		was found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical
		culture. The third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural
		network models of the self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen,
		T. (1997). Self-organizing maps (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer).  One
		model was trained on the excerpts of yoiks used in the behavioral
		experiment including the correct continuation tone, while another was
		trained with a set of Finnish folk songs and Lutheran hymns. The
		convergence of the three approaches showed that both listeners and
		the SOM model are influenced by the statistical distributions of
		tones and tone sequences. The listeners and SOM models also provided
		evidence supporting a core set of psychological principles underlying
		melody formation whose relative weights appear to differ across
		musical styles.},

	ABSTRACT = {This article is a study of Finnish spiritual folk hymns,
		combining three different approaches to understanding melodic
		expectancy. The first is a behavioral experiment in which listeners
		made judgments about melodic continuations. Two groups of listeners
		participated. One had extensive experience with the style and was
		familiar with the particular hymns. The other consisted of musicians
		who were unfamiliar with the hymns. The second approach was a

		hymns. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone
		onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. The third approach
		simulated melodic expectancy with neural network models of the
		self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen, 1997). One model was trained
		on the corpus of 18 hymns, while another was trained with only the
		materials used in the experiment. Comparing the results showed strong
		convergence between the three approaches. The correspondences found
		between the behavioral judgments and the statistical style analysis
		supports the idea that listeners are sensitive to the distributions
		of tones and tone combinations in music. The non-experts' responses
		more strongly reflected the general distribution of tones than the
		experts, whereas the experts' responses more strongly reflected the
		specific tone transitions. Correspondences between the behavioral
		judgments and the SOMs were also strong and showed effects of
		expertise. The non-experts' responses were modeled better with the
		SOM that had been trained on the 18 hymn corpus, whereas the experts'
		responses were modeled better with the SOM that had been trained on
		the experimental materials, thus simulating the process of
		recognizing the particular hymns. Finally, all three approaches gave
		support to the implication-realization model (Narmour, 1990) of
		musical expectancy. Moreover, the relative weighting of the
		principles was similar for behavioral, statistical, and computational
		measures.},

             (identification of different musical sequences as

             theories, listeners judge the structural importance of
             musical events while forming mental
             representations. These judgments may result from the
             production of reduced memory representations that retain
             only the musical gist. In a study of improvised music
             performance, pianists produced variations on
             melodies. Analyses of the musical events retained across
             variations provided support for the reductionist account
             of structural importance. A neural network trained to
             produce reduced memory representations for the same
             melodies represented structurally important events more
             efficiently than others. Agreement among the musicians'
             improvisations, the network model, and music-theoretic
             predictions suggest that perceived constancy across
             musical variation is a natural result of a reductionist
             mechanism for producing memory representations.},

	ABSTRACT = {In order to ascertain whether the units of memetic
		transmission and recombination in the birdsong of a particular
		species of finch exist at the level of individual songs or instead at
		the level of grammar models, a large number of songs were subjected
		to grammar induction techniques and the resulting grammars analyzed
		for key structural properties considered indicative of the existence
		of an underlying grammar. The weight of evidence provided by this
		approach was judged by applying the same analyses to the results of a
		genetic algorithm applied to a synthetic repertoire of songs and
		comparing the results. Memetic evolution applied directly to song
		elements, as simulated by the genetic algorithm, was found to
		generate models very similar to those inferred from the House Finch
		song, thereby demonstrating that the problem of discerning between
		these two competing hypotheses for explaining the syntactic structure
		observed in House Finch song is not easily solved using the limited
		data obtainable in the field. This underscores the importance of
		experimental rigor when studying memetic systems, and leaves open the
		question of how to confidently determine the actual level at which
		memes are operating in a particular system.},

	ABSTRACT= {The information content, or "entropy", of a piece of
		music cannot be determined in the abstract, but depends on the
		listener's familiarity with, and knowledge of, the genre to which it
		belongs. This paper describes an experiment designed to investigate
		human listeners' models of music by having them guess successive
		notes in a piece. The experiment was administered by a computer
		program, and in order to elicit subjective probabilities, listeners
		gambled on the notes they guessed. The study was restricted to the
		music of the Bach Chorales, and, in particular, on the succession of
		pitches that comprise the melody -- although our methodology is also
		generally applicable to other musical parameters, and to other
		genres. A tournament was held, with categories of novice,
		intermediate, and expert musician. As well as providing an overall
		measure of entropy for each of two chorale melodies, the results
		yield entropy profiles for the individual chorales. These give an
		objective, scientifically repeatable record of the note--by--note
		information content of the melodies, which can be interpreted
		musically in terms of expectation, suspense, and resolution in the
		music.},

	ABSTRACT   = {In algorithmic music composition, a simple technique
             involves selecting notes sequentially according to a
             transition table that specifies the probability of the
             next note as a function of the previous context. An
             extension of this transition-table approach is described,
             using a recurrent autopredictive connectionist network
             called CONCERT. CONCERT is trained on a set of pieces
             with the aim of extracting stylistic
             regularities. CONCERT can then be used to compose new
             pieces. A central ingredient of CONCERT is the
             incorporation of psychologically grounded representations
             of pitch, duration and harmonic structure. CONCERT was
             tested on sets of examples artificially generated
             according to simple rules and was shown to learn the
             underlying structure, even where other approaches
             failed. In larger experiments, CONCERT was trained on
             sets of J.S. Bach pieces and traditional European folk
             melodies and was then allowed to compose novel
             melodies. The overall results cast doubt on the promise
             of note-by-note prediction for composition.},

	ABSTRACT   = {We outline a framework within which machine
             compositions may be evaluated objectively. In particular,
             the framework allows statements about those compositions
             to be refuted on the basis of empirical
             experimentation. We consider this to be fundamental if we
             wish to evaluate the degree to which our programs achieve
             their compositional aims. Furthermore, a review of the
             literature reveals that this is a largely ignored aspect
             of research into algorithmic composition. Our framework
             involves four components: specifying the compositional
             aims; inducing a critic from a set of example musical
             phrases; composing music that satisfies the critic; and
             evaluating specific claims about the compositions in
             experiments using human subjects. We describe a system
             which exemplifies these four stages and which
             demonstrates the practicality of the framework. Finally,
             the application of the framework to the evaluation of
             musical creativity is discussed and directions for future
             research are suggested.},

             from the local harmonic movement of a corpus of
             senteenth-century dance music. The probabilistic grammars
             so generated are then used for experiments in generation
             (composition). The corpus is preprocessed in a novel way,
             automatically converting the harmonies into a normal form
             to capture the underlying harmonic similarities between
             pieces. It is then automatically marked up with
             constituent boundaries (beginnings and ends of pieces,
             phrases and bars), to enable the learning process to
             capture some of the higher-level structure of the
             music. The experiment is promising, and a sample of the
             results are given. We discuss the limitations of the
             approach, and how they might be overcome. },

	ABSTRACT   = {A received view in music psychology is that to have
             assigned to a piece of music a certain kind of structural
             description (in which elements are marked as more or less
             prominent, or more or less related to one another) is to
             have understood it. Yet this view is open to the
             "Searlean" criticism that it has ignored the essential
             elements of human understanding of music, namely, the
             dynamic feelings of tension and resolution, anticipation,
             growth and decay, which the music engenders when
             experienced as structure. It is argued that these
             feelings are plausible candidates for the basic elements
             of a musical semantics. Such feelings are not emotions as
             commonly understood, although they may engender emotions
             in some circumstances. The characteristics of music which
             engender these feelings are similar (or analogous) to
             characteristics of the experienced physical and
             biological world, particularly of objects in motion (or
             agents in action). Thus, in some circumstances,
             combinations of these elemental feelings can give rise to
             the sense that music has "personality" or
             "atmosphere". Some psychological research investigating
             structural concomitants of dynamic feelings is
             discussed. },

	ABSTRACT   = {Researchers wishing to create computational systems
             that themselves generate artworks face two interacting
             challenges. The first is that the standards by which
             artistic output is judged are notoriously difficult to
             quantify. The larger AI community is currently involved
             in a rich internal dialogue on methodological issues,
             standards, and rigor, and hence murkiness with regard to
             the assessment of output must be faced squarely. The
             second challenge is that any artwork exists within an
             extraordinarily rich cultural and historical context, and
             it is rare that an artist who is ignorant of this context
             will produce acceptable works. In this paper the authors
             assert that these considerations argue for case-based
             AI/Art systems that take critical criteria as
             parameters. They describe an example system that produces
             new bebop jazz melodies from a case-base of melodies,
             using genetic programming techniques and a fitness
             function based on user-provided critical criteria. They
             discuss the role that such techniques may play in future
             work on AI and the arts.},

             being imbued with the rules of civilized human conduct,
             who could further learn how to behave and possibly even
             evolve through successive generations into a more perfect
             form. Modern human composers similarly strive to create
             intelligent algorithmic music composition systems that
             can follow prespecified rules, learn appropriate patterns
             from a collection of melodies, or evolve to produce
             output more perfectly matched to some aesthetic
             criteria. Here we review recent efforts aimed at each of
             these three types of algorithmic composition. We focus
             particularly on evolutionary methods, and indicate how
             monstrous many of the results have been. We present a new
             method that uses coevolution to create linked artificial
             music critics and music composers, and describe how this
             method can attach the separate parts of rules, learning,
             and evolution together into one coherent body. },

	ABSTRACT = {Meyer (1973) argued that listeners' experience of
		melodies is shaped by certain melodic "archetypes." Among these
		archetypes is "gap-fill," a name for melodies in which an early skip
		is followed by some of the pitches that have been skipped over. In
		experiments conducted with Rosner, Meyer sought to show that the
		gap-fill archetype can help explain the ways that listeners compare
		and classify melodies (Rosner & Meyer, 1982, 1986).  Reanalyses of
		the experimental results, however, suggest that gap-fill played
		little or no role. Together with an earlier study suggesting that
		gap-fill has no effect on melodic shape (von Hippel & Huron, 2000),
		these reanalyses weaken the claim that gap-fill is an important
		concept for classifying melodies.},

	ABSTRACT = {Evidence is presented that certain rules of melodic
		expectation are learned rather than innate. In an experiment, 28
		trained musicians and 12 non-musicians were asked to predict the
		direction of controlled experimental melodies. Whereas the musicians
		expectations fit two well-known rules, the rules were not evident in
		the expectancies of non-musicians. Moreover, the rules corresponded
		only approximately to melodic structure, suggesting the rough
		heuristics that people use to make predictions in other cognitive
		domains. In sum, the results suggest that musicians have learned
		imperfect but serviceable heuristics for making predictions in their
		area of expertise.},

             thinking in music, basing the model on past research and
             speculation. Elements of the model include groups of
             enabling conditions, enabling skills, and a central
             process that is seen as a movement from preparation to
             verification. There is discussion of the
             divergent/convergent thinking process as it relates to
             the three principle ways man involves himself with music:
             composition, performance/improvisation, and analysis
             (listening). The article concludes with a look into the
             possibilities of future research, including use of the
             author's own Measure of Creative Thinking in Music,
             ethnographic research, and computers and synthesizers.},

	ABSTRACT   = {Communication signals in many animal species (including
             humans) show a surprising amount of variety both across
             time and at any one instant in a population. Traditional
             accounts and simulation models of the evolution of
             communication offer little explanation of this
             diversity. Sexual selection of signals used to attract
             mates, and the coevolving preferences used to judge those
             signals, can instead provide a convincing mechanism. Here
             we demonstrate that a wide variety of ``songs'' can
             evolve when male organisms sing their songs to females
             who judge each male's output and decide whether or not to
             mate with him based on their own coevolved
             aesthetics. Evolved variety and rate of innovation are
             greatest when females combine inherited song preferences
             with a desire to be surprised. If females choose mates
             from a small pool of candidates, diversity and rate of
             change are also increased. Such diversity of
             communication signals may have implications for the
             evolution of brains as well. },

             giving a brief introduction to machine learning and
             discussing some general methodological questions, the
             article presents an ongoing project by the author as an
             example of a substantial and highly non-trivial
             application of machine learning to a musical problem. The
             basic music-theoretic assumptions of the project are
             discussed, the general method is briefly described, and
             some exemplary results are presented to give the reader
             an appreciation of the kinds of benefits musicology may
             draw from such research.},

             the 20th century in these more formal terms. I suggest
             that Boden s descriptive framework, once elaborated, is

             a different function and is of a different nature from
