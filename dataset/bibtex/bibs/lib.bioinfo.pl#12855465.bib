abstract={Motivation: A new method is developed to query a relational database in natural language (NL). Results: The method, based on a semantic approach, interprets grammatical and lexical units of a natural language into concepts of subject domain, which are given in a conceptual scheme. The conceptual scheme is mapped formally onto the logical scheme. We applied the method to query the FlyEx database in natural language. FlyEx contains information on the expression of segmentation genes in Drosophila melanogaster. The method allows formulation of queries in various natural languages simultaneously, and is adaptive to changes in the knowledge domain and user's views. It provides optimal transformation of queries from natural language to SQL, as well as visualization of information as a hyperscheme. The method does not require specification of all possible language constructions as well as a standard grammar accuracy in formulation of NL queries.
