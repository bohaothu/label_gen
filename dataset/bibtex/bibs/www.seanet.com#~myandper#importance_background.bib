              `When Chapter I was written ... I had not seen Forsyth's memoir,
              and had not been able to find an adopted English term for
              Lagrange's équation adjointé, so I used the word adjunct,
              suggested by the German adjungirte, and not unlike the French
              adjointe.  It seems better now, however, to employ the word
              associate, or, when speaking simply of Lagrange's équation
              adjointé, the word adjoint.'"

              The adjoint function is the optimal importance function for
              importance sampling.  In other words, if we knew the 
              optimal importance sampling function, one sample would be
              enough.  It is also suggested to solve the primary and the
