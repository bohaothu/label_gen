  ABSTRACT = {The World Wide Web provides a nearly endless source of knowledge, which
is mostly given in natural language. A first step towards exploiting
this data automatically could be to extract pairs of a given semantic
relation from text documents -- for example all pairs of a person and
her birthdate. One strategy for this task is to find text patterns that
express the semantic relation, to generalize these patterns, and to
apply them to a corpus to find new pairs. In this paper, we show that
this approach profits significantly when deep linguistic structures are
used instead of surface text patterns. We demonstrate how linguistic
structures can be represented for machine learning, and we provide a
theoretical analysis of the pattern matching approach. We show the
practical relevance of our approach by extensive experiments with our
prototype system LEILA.
