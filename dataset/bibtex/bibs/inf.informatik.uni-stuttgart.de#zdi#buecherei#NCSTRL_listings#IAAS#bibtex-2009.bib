   abstract = {Recent workflow languages are designed to serve the needs of business processes
      running in a unambiguous world based on unambiguous data. In contrast to
      business processes, processes running in a real world environment have to deal
      with data uncertainty and instability of the execution environment. Building a
      workflow language for real world flows based on a workflow language for
      business processes therefore may need additional modeling elements to be able
      to deal with this uncertainty and instability. Based on a real world process
      scenario we analyse and derive requirements for workflow language extensions
      for real world processes. The contributions provided by this paper are at first
      to investigate, how a workflow language can be extended properly followed up by
      the definition of workflow language extensions for real world processes,
      whereas the extensions are motivated by the real world process scenario. In
      this paper we use the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) as extension

   abstract = {When service-based applications implement business processes, it is important
      to monitor their performance in terms of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). If
      monitoring results show that the KPIs do not reach target values, the
      influential factors have to be analyzed and corresponding adaptation actions
      have to be taken. In this paper we present a novel adaptation approach for
      service-based applications (SBAs) based on a process quality factor analysis.
      This approach uses decision trees for showing the dependencies of KPIs on
      process quality factors from different functional levels of an SBA. We extend
      the monitoring and analysis approach and show how the analysis results may be
      used to come up with an adaptation strategy leading to an SBA that satisfies
      KPI values. The approach includes creation of a model which associates
      adaptation actions to process quality metrics, extraction of adaptation
      requirements based on analysis results, and identification of an adaptation
      strategy which can consist of several adaptation actions on different
      functional levels of an SBA.},

      Therefore, it is desirable for providers to predict possible violations before
      they happen, while it is still possible to set counteractive measures. We
      propose an approach for predicting SLA violations at runtime, which uses
      measured and estimated facts (instance data of the composition or QoS of used
      services) as input for a prediction model. The prediction model is based on
      machine learning regression techniques, and trained using historical process
      instances. We present the architecture of our approach and a prototype

      process knowledge is distributed knowledge and not completely known just by one
      person. Driven by this assumption we deal in this paper with the following
      questions: How can partial process knowledge be represented? How can this
      partial knowledge be used to define something more complete? To use higher
      level artefacts as building blocks to new applications has a long tradition in
      software engineering to increase flexibility and reduce modeling costs. In this
      paper we take a first step in applying this concept to processes, by defining
      process building blocks and operations which compose process building blocks.
      The building blocks will be referred to as process fragments in the following.
      The process fragment composition may take place either at design or runtime of
      the process. The design time approach reduces design costs by reusing
      artefacts. However the runtime fragment composition approach realizes high
      flexibility due to the possibility in the dynamic selection of the fragments to
      be composed. The contribution of this work lies in a fragment definition that
      enables the fragment modeler to represent his ’local’ and fragmentary knowledge
      in a formal way and which allows fragment models to be composed.},

      The growing number of internal and external regulations that companies need to

      We introduce the concept of a business process template that implicitly
      contains compliance constraints as well as points of variability. We further
      present an algorithm that ensures that these constraints cannot be violated. We
      also show how these algorithms can be used to check whether a customization of
      this process template is valid regarding these compliance constraints. So the
      designer of a business process, in contrast to the template designer, does not
      have to worry about compliance of the eventual process.
      
      In a final step we show how these general concepts can be applied to WS-BPEL.},

      The resources are offered in a “utility-like” manner by providers based on
      actual-use-based prices. It is expected that cloud computing will change the
      way how organizations will use IT and think about IT: ultimately, cloud
      computing may relieve organizations from owning their own IT environment. In
      this article we show that cloud computing can be seen as the next step in an
      evolution from isolated computers over clusters and beyond grids. We suggest a
      definition of clouds by abstracting their most important characteristics. The
      current set of cloud offerings is organized in a layered structure, and we
      propose an additional layer on top of that allowing to build applications in a
      composite manner (“composite as a service”). The distributed architecture of
      such composite cloud applications is derived by considering the structure of
      the individual services being composed. Finally, we argue that predefined

      problem. In this paper we describe these difficulties which result from the
      combination of very distinct areas. On the one hand, applications from area of
      measurement engineering manage sensors that capture data and annotate the data
      with technical meta data. On the other hand, context-aware workflows from the
      BPM area place high level requirements for the quality of context data that is
      derived from the sensor data. Between those two areas exists a gap that has to

      as an extension of the WS-Policy framework. We introduce the architecture of

      address this challenge we introduce the concept of pointers in SOA. Pointers

      for Web Service communication. Furthermore we show an extension of BPEL that
      introduces reference variables as new type of data containers in workflows. In

      service requesters and service providers to enable late binding of services at
      deployment time or even dynamic binding of services at runtime. This is
      important in enterprise settings, where different services that implement
      business functions in critical business processes are dynamically chosen based
      on availability or price. The same problem also applies to dynamic Grid
      environments where resources need to be dynamically chosen based on
      availability and other non-functional properties. The WS-Policy framework
      describes how policies for both providers and requesters are specified to allow
      the selection of services based on these policies. Existing approaches, using
      WS-Policy, have drawbacks by placing the burden of the service selection
      partially on the client. In this paper we present an approach to extend an
      enterprise service bus that allows service clients to submit policies the
      service provider needs to comply with directly in the message that triggers the
      service invocation. We show how these policies are evaluated in the bus and how

      lead to more complex models in both, BPEL and BPMN, and enable a roundtrip for
      only a limited number of scenarios. In this paper we show how BPEL processes

      undoing the work done by one or more activities. In the context of workflow,
      where compensation actions are defined on nested 'scopes' that group
      activities, this requires a model of nested compensation---based transactions.
      The model must enable the automatic determination of compensation order by
      considering not only the nesting of scopes but also the control dependencies
      between them. The current standard for Web services workflows, Business Process
      Execution Language for Web Services (WS-BPEL), has such compensation
      capabilities. In this paper, we show that the current mechanism in WS-BPEL
      shows compensation processing anomalies, such as neglecting control link
      dependencies between nested non-isolated scopes. We then propose an alternate
      approach that through elimination of default handlers as well as the complete
      elimination of termination handlers not only removes those anomalies but also
      relaxes current WS-BPEL restrictions on control links. The result is a new and
      deterministic model for handling default compensation for scopes in structures
      where: (1) both fault handling and compensation handling are present and (2)
      the relationships between scopes include both structured nesting and
      graph---based links.},

      applications with services such as message routing and transformation, service
      compositions, dynamic discovery, transactional support, coordination, security
      features, and others. In an ESB supporting SOAP message exchange routing
      algorithms typically follow the sequential SOAP message processing model, where
      SOAP headers are the main artefacts used to specify the message route and the
      processing of the payload by intermediaries along that route. This model
      supports neither alternative nor parallel message routes. In the case of a
      failing intermediary node this leads to a failure in the message delivery.
      Moreover, the execution order of services on SOAP message payloads at the
      intermediaries cannot be prescribed. In this paper, we demonstrate how the
      deficiencies of the SOAP message processing model can be addressed. We
      introduce an approach that allows for specifying SOAP message routing logic in
      terms of BPEL processes. We show that parallel and alternative routes for SOAP
      messages can be modelled and executed, and the order of services that process a
      message at intermediaries can be predefined to accommodate the correct
      processing sequence, as required by the concrete application domain. Features
      like dynamic discovery of services and flexible service composition are
      leveraged to enable flexible SOAP message routing.},

      importance for non-technical business users to ease and harmonize the
      development of EAI scenarios. These patterns describe recurring EAI challenges

      architects to decide how to manually implement an integration scenario. Thus,
      patterns are not theoretical thought to stand for artefacts that will
      immediately be executed. This paper presents a tool supporting a method how EAI
      patterns can be used to automatically generate executable artefacts for various

   abstract = {Message exchange patterns provide means to define the message flow of a service
      and how these messages are related in an abstract and reusable manner. They are
      an integral part of WSDL 2.0 and allow defining operations that have a message
      exchange beyond request-response. They reduce the impedance mismatch between
      imperative programming and message orientation while emphasizing the message
      orientated nature of Web Services. Whereas BPEL defines a flow between Web
      Service operations, BPEL light is an appropriate candidate to define the flow
      within operations since it abstracts from WSDL. In this article we use BPEL
      light to capture complex message exchanges. We show how its partner model can
      be used to not only define bi-lateral message exchanges but also those
      conversations that involve different partner types and/or multiple instances of
      such partners. Therefore we introduce first-class mechanisms to store, query
      and thus distinguish addressing information related to multiple partner
      instances. In addition, we increase reusability by allowing recursive
      definitions of such models. Thus, we enable modelling message exchange patterns
      that capture business logic in a reusable manner on an abstract level like for
      instance a request for bid scenario or a business transaction for purchase.
      Finally, we show how such patterns can be generically mapped to transport
      protocols.},

      guarantee a certain level of service. Hence, service provider and service
      consumer agree on Service Level Agreements (SLA) that definne the behavior and

      want to model their own service level according to their individual business
      needs. As a first step, we introduce an application model which enables the
      outsourcing of applications. In addition, we present corresponding models for
      describing QoS requirements and SLAs. To assure the requested QoS, the provider
      has to determine the QoS requirements of each application component. In this
      work, we determine the QoS requirement of a component by disaggregating the QoS
      requirements stated in the SLA. After the disaggregation the provider deploys

      fact is denoted as Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) problem and is one
      of the major challenges IT departments are facing today.
      
      As a result of the need for operational flexibility and reuse, Service-oriented
      Architectures (SOA) gain more and more importance as they allow for a flexible
      and standardized way to describe, reuse and integrate services in heterogeneous
      application landscapes. Enterprise Application Integration Patterns (EAI
      Patterns) are a means to describe integration problems using a set of patterns.
      The patterns therefore present nuggets of advice on how to solve complex
      recurring integration problems.
      
      In this paper we introduce a platform independent approach (EMod) to model,
      describe and enact EAI patterns in service oriented architectures. We describe
      how EMod can be used to build standalone EAI solutions that integrate different
      applications in a Software as a Service (SaaS) environment. Furthermore we show
      how EMod can be used as a part of an application to integrate services into
      composite service-oriented applications. This is done by integrating EMod into
      the Service Component Architecture (SCA).},

      requirements framework for service choreography languages, along which existing
      choreography languages are assessed. The requirements framework provides the
      basis for introducing the language BPEL4Chor, which extends the industry
      standard WS-BPEL with choreography-specific concepts. A validation is provided
      and integration with executable service orchestrations is discussed.},

   abstract = {Petri Nets are a formalism for describing coordinated interactions between
      independent entities, called transitions, by means of synchronized token
      exchange through places. Tuplespaces are an abstraction of the shared memory
      concept providing means for loosely-coupled coordination between individual
      components. In the tuplespace model, coordination between applications is
      achieved by production and blocking consumption of tuples which are
      communicated over tuplespace buffers. On the basis of the conceptual
      similarities of Petri nets and tuplespaces, we investigate in this paper
      whether tuplespaces are a suitable platform for execution of applications
      modeled as Petri net-based workflows, motivate an extension to the original
      tuplespace interface to facilitate efficient synchronization of control flow,
      and highlight its benefits by providing quantitative and qualitative
      evaluations of an application using the traditional tuplespace interface versus
      an application using our extension.},

      Context-aware applications adapt their behavior according to the current
      situation. In this paper we present a layered model to separate different tasks
      and concerns in designing data models for context-aware applications. The
      layers are discussed along the Nexus approach, which is designed to support
      large-scale, mobile applications by federated context models. Furthermore,
      related approaches are described and compared.

      Kontextbezogene Anwendungen adaptieren ihr Verhalten aufgrund von Situationen.
      Dieser Beitrag pr{\"a}sentiert ein Ebenenmodell f{\"u}r Datenmodelle solcher
      Anwendungen, das verschiedene Probleme und Aufgaben im Entwurf der Daten, der
      Adaptionslogik und der Verarbeitung kapselt. Die Ebenen werden anhand des
      Nexus-Ansatzes diskutiert, dessen Ziel es ist, mobile, kontext-bezogene
      Anwendungen durch f{\"o}derierte Kontextmodelle zu unterst{\"u}tzen, und mit verwandten
      Arbeiten verglichen.},

   abstract = {The common overarching goal of service bus and Grid middleware is
      ``virtualization'' – virtualization of business functions and virtualization of
      resources, respectively. By combining both capabilities a new infrastructure
      called ``Business Grid'' results. This infrastructure meets the requirements of
      both business applications and scientific computations in a unified manner and
      in particular those that are not addressed by the middleware infrastructures in
      each of the fields. Furthermore, it is the basis for enacting new trends like
      Software as a Service or Cloud computing. In this paper the overall
      architecture of the Business Grid is outlined. The Business Grid applications
      are described and the need for their customizability and adaptability is
      advocated. Requirements on the Business Grid like concurrency, multi-tenancy
      and scalability are addressed. The concept of ``provisioning flows'' and other
      mechanisms to enable scalability as required by a high number of concurrent
      users are outlined.},

   abstract = {Even though process orientation/BPM is a widely accepted paradigm with heavy
      impact on industry and research the available technology does not support the
      business professionals’ tasks in an appropriate manner that is in a way
      allowing processes modeling using concepts from the business domain. This
      results in a gap between the business people expertise and the IT knowledge
      required. The current trend in bridging this gap is to utilize technologies
      developed for the Semantic Web, for example ontologies, while maintaining
      reusability and flexibility of processes. In this chapter the authors present
      an overview of existing technologies, supporting the BPM lifecycle, and focus
      on potential benefits Semantic Web technologies can bring to BPM. The authors
      will show how these technologies help automate the transition between the
      inherently separate/detached business professionals’ level and the IT level
      without the burden of additional knowledge acquisition on behalf of the
      business professionals. As background information they briefly discuss existing
      process modeling notations like the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)
      as well as the execution centric Business Process Execution Language (BPEL),
      and their limitations in terms of proper support for the business professional.
      The chapter stresses on the added value Semantic Web technologies yield when
      leveraged for the benefit of BPM. For this the authors give examples of
      existing BPM techniques that can be improved by using Semantic Web
      technologies, as well as novel approaches which became possible only through
      the availability of semantic descriptions. They show how process model
      configuration can be automated and thus simplified and how flexibility during
      process execution is increased. Additionally, they present innovative
      techniques like automatic process composition and auto-completion of process
      models where suitable process fragments are automatically discovered to make up
      the process model. They also present a reference architecture of a BPM system
      that utilizes Semantic Web technologies in an SOA environment.},

      kein klassischer Workshop, bei dem fertige Forschungsergebnisse ver{\"o}ffentlicht
      und pr{\"a}sentiert werden. Stattdessen steht die Diskussion von Ideen, die sich
      noch in einem f{\"u}hen Entwicklungsstadium befinden, im Vordergrund. So erhalten
      Teilnehmer bereits vor der Einreichung eines Konferenzpapieres erste
      R{\"u}ckmeldungen au{\ss}erhalb ihrer Gruppe. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus erlaubt der Workshop durch
      seine regionale Ausrichtung den Aufbau eines wissenschaftlichen Netzwerkes, das
      intensiv und zu geringen Kosten genutzt werden kann. Er richtet sich dabei
      insbesondere an junge deutschsprachige Forscher im Service-Bereich. Der erste
      ZEUS-Workshops findet am 2. und 3. M{\"a}rz 2009 in Stuttgart statt. Veranstalter
      ist das Institut f{\"u}r Architektur von Anwendungssystemen der Universit{\"a}t
      Stuttgart. Es gab 17 eingereichte Beitr{\"a}ge, die alle nach kurzer Begutachtung
      in das Programm aufgenommen wurden. Weiterhin wird es einen eingeladenen
      Vortrag von Prof. Karsten Wolf (Universit{\"a}t Rostock) geben. Wir hoffen, dass
      die Vortr{\"a}ge eine gelungene Grundlage f{\"u}r rege Diskussionen bieten.},
