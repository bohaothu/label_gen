                  lambda-interpreters, i.e., evaluation functions
                  for lambda-terms, and abstract reduction
                  machines for the lambda-calculus, i.e.,
                  transition functions. The two key derivation
                  steps are the CPS transformation and Reynolds's
                  defunctionalization. By transforming the
                  interpreter into continuation-passing style
                  (CPS), its flow of control is made manifest as
                  a continuation. By defunctionalizing this
                  continuation, the flow of control is
                  materialized as a first-order data
                  structure.\bibpar
                  
                  The derivation applies not merely to connect
                  independently known lambda-interpreters and
                  abstract machines, it also applies to construct
                  the abstract machine corresponding to a
                  lambda-interpreter and to construct the
                  lambda-interpreter corresponding to an abstract
                  machine. In this article, we treat in detail
                  the canonical example of Landin's SECD machine
                  and we reveal its denotational content: the
                  meaning of an expression is a partial
                  endo-function from a stack of intermediate
                  results and an environment to a new stack of
                  intermediate results and an environment. The
                  corresponding lambda-interpreter is
                  unconventional because (1) it uses a control
                  delimiter to evaluate the body of each
                  lambda-abstraction and (2) it assumes the
                  environment to be managed in a callee-save
                  fashion instead of in the usual caller-save

                  the {\em packet filter}. In this paper, we

                  We show that a traditional ordered rule set can
                  always be expressed as a first-order logic
                  formula on integer variables. Moreover, we
                  emphasize that, with such specification, the
                  packet filtering problem is known to be
                  constant time ($O(1)$). We propose to represent
                  the first-order logic formula as {\em Interval
                  Decision Diagrams}. This structure has several
                  advantages. First, the algorithm for removing
                  redundancy and unnecessary tests is very
                  simple. Secondly, it allows us to handle
                  integer variables which makes it efficient on a
                  generic CPUs. And, finally, we introduce an
                  extension of IDDs called {\em Multi-Terminal
                  Interval Decision Diagrams} in order to deal
                  with any number of policies.\bibpar
                  
                  In matter of efficiency, we evaluate the
                  performance our framework through a prototype
                  toolkit composed by a {\em compiler} and a {\em
                  packet filter}. The results of the experiments

                  some of the individuals in it, the aim of
                  consistency checking is to determine whether
                  these data are consistent with the classic

                  information, and is well motivated from both a
                  biological and a sociological viewpoint. This
                  paper shows that consistency checking is
                  NP-complete, even in the presence of three

                  construction provides a correct abstraction for
                  the behaviours of timed automata, but it does
                  not support a natural implementation and, in
                  practice, algorithms based on the notion of
                  zones are implemented using adapted data
                  structures like DBMs. When we focus on forward
                  analysis algorithms, the exact computation of
                  all the successors of the initial
                  configurations does not always terminate. Thus,
                  some abstractions are often used to ensure
                  termination, among which, a widening operator
                  on zones.\bibpar
                  In this paper, we study in details this
                  widening operator and the forward analysis
                  algorithm that uses it. This algorithm is most
                  used and implemented in tools like Kronos and

                  hopeless to find a forward analysis algorithm,
                  that uses such a widening operator, and which
                  is correct. This goes really against what one
                  could think. We then study in details this
                  algorithm in the more general framework of
                  updatable timed automata, a model which has
                  been introduced as a natural syntactic
                  extension of classical timed automata. We

                  Obtaining a KMP-like string matcher is a

                  starting from the naive, quadratic program
                  checking whether a pattern occurs in a text,
                  one ensures that backtracking can be performed
                  at partial-evaluation time (a binding-time
                  shift that yields a staged string matcher);
                  specializing the resulting staged program
                  yields residual programs that do not back up on
                  the text, a la KMP. We are not aware, however,
                  of any formal proof that partial evaluation of
                  a staged string matcher precisely yields the

                  the same sequence of comparisons between
                  pattern and text as the KMP string matcher. To
                  this end, we operationally specify each of the
                  programming languages in which the matchers are
                  written, and we formalize each sequence of
                  comparisons with a trace semantics. We also
                  state the (mild) conditions under which
                  specializing the staged string matcher with
                  respect to a pattern string provably yields a

                  to reduce this complexity to quadratic time.\bibpar
                  Lambda-lifting transforms a block-structured program
                  into a set of recursive equations, one for each
                  local function in the source program. Each equation
                  carries extra parameters to account for the free
                  variables of the corresponding local function and of
                  all its callees. It is the search for these extra
                  parameters that yields the cubic factor in the
                  traditional formulation of lambda-lifting, which is
                  due to Johnsson. This search is carried out by a
                  transitive closure.\bibpar Instead, we partition the
                  call graph of the source program into strongly
                  connected components, based on the simple
                  observation that all functions in each component
                  need the same extra parameters and thus a transitive
                  closure is not needed. We therefore simplify the
                  search for extra parameters by treating each
                  strongly connected component instead of each
                  function as a unit, thereby reducing the time
                  complexity of lambda-lifting from O(n3logn) to
                  O(n2logn), where n is the size of the program"

                  The idea is that the recursive calls get us
                  there (typically to a base case) and the
                  returns get us back again {\em while traversing

                  pattern of traversing a data structure at
                  return time ``There And Back Again''
                  (TABA).\bibpar
                  The TABA pattern directly applies to computing
                  a symbolic convolution. It also synergizes well
                  with other programming patterns, e.g., dynamic
                  programming and traversing a list at double
                  speed. We illustrate TABA and dynamic
                  programming with Catalan numbers. We illustrate
                  TABA and traversing a list at double speed with
                  palindromes and we obtain a novel solution to
                  this traditional exercise.\bibpar
                  A TABA-based function written in direct style
                  makes full use of an Algol-like control stack

                  TABA-based function written in
                  continuation-passing style, the continuation
                  acts as a list iterator. In general, the TABA

                  linkage analysis is introduced. Linkage
                  analysis is a computationally hard
                  biomathematical method, which purpose is to
                  locate genes on the human genome. It is rooted
                  in the new area of bioinformatics and no
                  formalization of the method has previously been
                  established. Initially, the biological model is
                  presented. On the basis of this biological
                  model we establish a formalization that enables
                  reasoning about algorithms used in linkage
                  analysis. The formalization applies both for
                  single and multi point linkage analysis. We
                  illustrate the usage of the formalization in
                  correctness proofs of central algorithms and
                  optimisations for linkage analysis. A further
                  use of the formalization is to reason about
                  alternative methods for linkage analysis. We
                  discuss the use of MTBDDs and PDGs in linkage
                  analysis, since they have proven efficient for
                  other computationally hard problems involving
                  large state spaces. We conclude that none of
                  the techniques discussed are directly
                  applicable to linkage analysis, however further
                  research is needed in order to investigated

                  security protocols is known to have some
                  limitations in the patterns of nondeterminism
                  it allows and in the ways in which strand
                  spaces can be composed. Its successful
                  application to a broad range of security
                  protocols may therefore seem surprising. This
                  paper gives a formal explanation of the wide
                  applicability of strand spaces. We start with
                  an extension of strand spaces which permits
                  several operations to be defined in a
                  compositional way, forming a process language
                  for building up strand spaces. We then show,
                  under reasonable conditions how to reduce the
                  extended strand spaces to ones of a traditional
                  kind. For security protocols we are mainly
                  interested in their safety properties. This
                  suggests a strand-space equivalence: two strand
                  spaces are equivalent if and only if they have
                  essentially the same sets of bundles. However
                  this equivalence is not a congruence with
                  respect to the strand-space operations. By
                  extending the notion of bundle we show how to
                  define the strand-space operations directly on
                  ``bundle spaces''. This leads to a
                  characterisation of the largest congruence
                  within the strand-space equivalence. Finally,
                  we relate strand spaces to event structures, a
                  well known model for concurrency.",

                  is canonically defined as the transitive
                  closure of (1) decomposing a program into an
                  evaluation context and a redex, (2) contracting
                  this redex, and (3) plugging the contractum in
                  the context. Directly implementing this

                  each step, that is linear in the size of the

                  plugging and (1) decomposing by a single

                  programming interactive Web services.\bibpar
                  A fundamental aspect of the development of the
                  World Wide Web during the last decade is the
                  gradual change from static to dynamic
                  generation of Web pages. Generating Web pages
                  dynamically in dialogue with the client has the
                  advantage of providing up-to-date and
                  tailor-made information. The development of
                  systems for constructing such dynamic Web
                  services has emerged as a whole new research
                  area.\bibpar
                  The {\tt<bigwig>} language is designed by
                  analyzing its application domain and
                  identifying fundamental aspects of Web services
                  inspired by problems and solutions in existing
                  Web service development languages. The core of
                  the design consists of a session-centered
                  service model together with a flexible
                  template-based mechanism for dynamic Web page
                  construction. Using specialized program
                  analyses, certain Web specific properties are
                  verified at compile-time, for instance that
                  only valid HTML 4.01 is ever shown to the
                  clients. In addition, the design provides
                  high-level solutions to form field validation,
                  caching of dynamic pages, and temporal-logic
                  based concurrency control, and it proposes
                  syntax macros for making highly domain-specific
                  languages. The language is implemented via
                  widely available Web technologies, such as
                  Apache on the server-side and JavaScript and
                  Java Applets on the client-side. We conclude
