                 conjecture that numbers of the form $M(n) = 2^{n}-1$
                 are prime for $n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67,
                 127,$ and $257$, but could not test this claim. Euler
                 showed in 1750 that $M(31)$ is prime. Lucas showed in
                 1876 that $M(127)$ is prime. Pervouchine showed in 1883
                 that $M(61)$ is prime, finally disproving the Mersenne
                 conjecture. Powers in the early 1900s showed that
                 $M(89)$ and $M(107)$ are prime, both missed by
                 Mersenne. By 1947, it was known that the correct list
                 is $2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107$, and
                 $127$, so Mersenne had five errors in his list: $67$
                 and $257$ should have been removed, and $61, 89$, and
                 $107$ added. By late 2001, 39 Mersenne primes were
                 known, the five largest having been found by massive
                 distributed computing efforts through the Great
                 Internet Mersenne Primes Search (GIMPS) project. The
                 largest of these is $M(13466917)$, a number containing

                 A specialist code-breaker was brought in to crack the
                 shorthand that Roger Morrice, a Puritan minister turned
                 political journalist, used in part of the diary to stop
                 the King's agents reading it. \ldots{} \par

                 volumes of Morrice's well-informed account of a
                 turbulent period during which England was ruled by
                 three different monarchs will be published in 2005.\par
                 About 40,000 words of the diary were in code and the

  abstract =     "Three cyphers allegedly authored by Thomas Jefferson
                 Beale in 1822 have been the subject of intensive study
                 for over 100 years. Generations of cryptanalysts have
                 expended untold man-years, thus far without success,
                 attempting tode code them; vast armies of fortune
                 hunters and treasure seekers have devoted Herculean
                 labors to digging up the rolling hills of Virginia
                 trying to locate the promised bonanza. \par

                 The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,
                 yet serious students of cryptography have always had
                 nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity. It has
                 been alleged that the ``known solution'' to Cypher
                 Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49, \ldots{} (``I
                 have deposited in the County of Bedford about four
                 miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault
                 \ldots{}'') with the aid of an unsanitized version of
                 the Declaration of Independence was merely a superb,
                 imaginative, and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago
                 for whatever reasons. Modern computer technology could
                 obviously perform signature analyses the process of
                 encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
                 insights into their construction. For the benefit of
                 the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second
                 cypher employs a specified document whose words are
                 simply numbered consecutively, and first letters of
                 these words are sought out at random to match the
                 letters of these words are sought out at random to
                 match the letters of the clear text or message.
                 \par

                 The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches
                 is then written down as the final code. While
                 primitive, the process has the advantage of relative
                 security until the source document becomes known; at
                 that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second
                 graders. The work now completed with the help of our
                 UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the
                 Beale cyphers and various types of simulations.
                 \par

                 For example, we have turned the entire process of
                 simulated encoding by various schemes over to the
                 machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic
                 codes; we have also encoded various messages by hand,
                 using different texts and a variety of methods to
                 obtain their signatures. These simulations provide
                 convincing evidence that the signatures are both
                 process and data dependent; they indicate also very
                 strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that
                 it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the
                 correct source document and locates the right vault in
                 the common-wealth of Virginia.",

                 routines. Standard deviations were computed for 100
                 runs by each method, and from this the range of error
                 at the 95 percent confidence level was calculated. The

                 data and for storing the ciphertext was separately
                 measured (the ``null transformation''), and was then

                 files by means of privacy transformations must be
                 considered as a problem distinct from that for
                 sequential files. Not only must processing overhead due
                 to encrypting be considered, but also threats to
                 encipherment arising from updating and the file
                 structure itself must be countered. A general
                 encipherment scheme is proposed for files maintained in
                 a paged structure in secondary storage. This is applied
                 to the encipherment of indexes organized as $B$-trees;
                 a $B$-tree is a particular type of multiway search
                 tree. Threats to the encipherment of $B$-trees,
                 especially relating to updating, are examined, and
                 countermeasures are proposed for each. In addition, the
                 effect of encipherment on file access and update, on
                 paging mechanisms, and on files related to the
                 enciphered index are discussed. Many of the concepts
                 presented may be readily transferred to other forms of
                 multiway index trees and to binary search trees.",

                 network can be protected by cryptography. In a data
                 processing environment, cryptography is implemented by
                 an algorithm which utilizes a secret key, or sequence
                 of bits. Any key-controlled cryptographic algorithm,
                 such as the Data Encryption Standard, requires a
                 protocol for the management of its cryptographic keys.
                 The complexity of the key management protocol
                 ultimately depends on the level of functional
                 capability provided by the cryptographic system. This
                 paper discusses a possible key management scheme that
                 provides the support necessary to protect
                 communications between individual end users (end-to-end
                 encryption) and that also can be used to protect data

                 security, it is necessary to transmit a key, by secret

                 This paper shows that it is possible to select a key
                 over open communications channels in such a fashion
                 that communications security can be maintained. A
                 method is described which forces any enemy to expend an
                 amount of work which increases as the square of the
                 work required of the two communicants to select the
                 key. The method provides a logically new kind of
                 protection against the passive eaves dropper. It
                 suggests that further research on this topic will be

                 This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or
                 other secure means are not needed to transmit keys,
                 since a message can be enciphered using an encryption
                 key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. (2) A
                 message can be ``signed'' using a privately held
                 decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using
                 the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key.
                 Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later
                 deny the validity of his signature.",

                 they should be supplemented with simulations, models,
                 and other analysis and design tools of our trade.

                 functions with certain desirable properties, and
                 introduce two novel applications for hashing which make
                 use of these functions. One class contains a small
                 number of functions, yet is almost universal2. If the
                 functions hash n-bit long names into m-bit indices,
                 then specifying a member of the class requires only
                 O((m + log2 log2(n)) g log2(n)) bits as compared to
                 O(n) bits for earlier techniques. For long names, this
                 is about a factor of m larger than the lower bound of m
                 + log2n log2m bits. An application of this class is a
                 provably secure authentication technique for sending
                 messages over insecure lines. A second class of
                 functions satisfies a much stronger property than
                 universal2. We present the application of testing sets
                 for equality. The authentication technique allows the
                 receiver to be certain that a message is genuine. An
                 ``enemy'' even one with infinite computer resources
                 cannot forge or modify a message without detection. The
                 set equality technique allows operations including
                 ``add member to set,'' ``delete member from set,'' and
                 ``test two sets for equality'' to be performed in
                 expected constant time and with less than a specified
                 probability of error.",

                 general primitives for protection and authentication.
                 The mechanism is based on the idea of sealing an object
                 with a key. Sealed objects are self-authenticating, and
                 in the absence of an appropriate set of keys, only
                 provide information about the size of their contents.
                 New keys can be freely created at any time, and keys
                 can also be derived from existing keys with operators
                 that include Key-And and Key-Or. This flexibility
                 allows the protection mechanism to implement common
                 protection mechanisms such as capabilities, access
                 control lists, and information flow control. The
                 mechanism is enforced with a synthesis of conventional
                 cryptography, public-key cryptography, and a threshold

                 (such as password) must be managed in such a way that
                 users and machines from different organizations can
                 easily authenticate themselves to each other. The
                 authentication facility must be secure, but user
                 convenience, decentralized administration, and a
                 capability for smooth, long-term evolution are also
                 important. In addition, the authentication arrangements
                 must not permit failures at a single node to cause
                 systemwide down time. The design used in the Xerox 8000
                 Series products is described. This design anticipates
                 applications in an open-network architecture where
                 there are nodes from diverse sources and one node does
                 not trust authentication checking done by other nodes.
                 Furthermore, in some offices encryption will be
                 required to authenticate data transmissions despite
                 hostile intruders on the network. Requirements and
                 design constraints when applying encryption for
                 authentication in office systems are discussed. It is
                 suggested that protocol standards for use in office
                 systems should allow unencrypted authentication as well
                 as two options for encrypted authentication. Issues
                 that will arise as an office system evolves to deal
                 with increasingly sophisticated threats from users of
                 the system are described.",

  abstract =     "To solve the problem of inferring sequences produced
                 by pseudo-random number generators of a particular
                 form, one must present an efficient inference method
                 which, from knowledge of some of the numbers in a
                 sequence, predicts the remainder of the sequence.
                 Pseudo-random number generators of the following forms
                 are considered: (1) Linear congruential method,
                 $X(,i+1) = a X(,i) + b \bmod m$. (2) Linear congruences
                 with $n$ terms in the recurrence, for fixed $n$, $X(,i)
                 = a(,1) X(,i-1) + a(,2) X(,i-2) + (.)(.)(.) + a(,n)
                 X(,i-n) + a(,n+1) \bmod m$. (3) Quadratic congruences,
                 $X(,i+1) = a X(,i)('2) + b X(,i) + c \bmod m$. In each
                 case, it is assumed that the coefficients and the
                 modulus are unknown. It is also assumed that whenever
                 an incorrect prediction occurs, the correct value is
                 revealed before the next prediction is made. Sequences
                 of the first type can be predicted with no more than $2
                 + \log(,2) m$ errors, sequences of the second type with
                 no more than $2 + n('2) \log(,2) nm$ errors, and
                 sequences of the third type with no more than $4 + 3
                 \log(,2)m$ errors. All of the inference methods
                 presented are efficient. This shows that pseudo-random
                 number generators in any of these forms are
                 cryptographically insecure.",

  abstract =     "An encryption method is presented with the novel
                 property that publicly revealing an encryption key does
                 not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key.
                 This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or
                 other secure means are not needed to transmit keys,
                 since a message can be enciphered using an encryption
                 key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only
                 he can decipher the message, since only he knows the
                 corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be
                 ``signed'' using a privately held decryption key.
                 Anyone can verify this signature using the
                 corresponding publicly revealed encryption key.
                 Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later
                 deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious
                 applications in ``electronic mail'' and ``electronic
                 funds transfer'' systems. A message is encrypted by
                 representing it as a number $M$, raising $M$ to a
                 publicly specified power $e$, and then taking the
                 remainder when the result is divided by the publicly

                 high-level network protocols operating in an
                 open-system environment are analyzed. First the threats
                 to security that may arise in such an environment are
                 described, and then a set of goals for communications
                 security measures is established. This is followed by a
                 brief description of the two basic approaches to
                 communications security, link-oriented measures and
                 end-to-end measures, which concludes that end-to-end
                 measures are more appropriate in an open-system
                 environment. Next, relevant properties of data
                 encryption --- the fundamental technique on which all
                 communications security mechanisms are based --- are
                 discussed. The remainder of the paper describes how
                 end-to-end measures can be used to achieve each of the
                 security goals previously established.",

                 to the protection of computing systems and the
                 information they maintain against deliberate or
                 accidental threats. Motivations for security measures
                 are discussed. Security strategies are considered.
                 Actions and events that threaten security are
                 described, along with technical problems that can
                 prevent the computer from adequately dealing with
                 threats. Security models are surveyed. Specific
                 technical and administrative measures for promoting
                 security are described. Among the technical measures
                 discussed are design of secure systems, hardware and
                 operating systems, identification of users, encryption,
                 and access control packages. Administrative measures
                 include personnel, physical security of the computing
                 system, and auditing.",

  abstract =     "The unicity distance of a cascade of random ciphers,
                 with respect to known plaintext attack, is shown to be
                 the sum of the key lengths. At time-space trade-off for
                 the exhaustive cracking of a cascade of ciphers is
                 shown. The structure of the set of permutations
                 realized by a cascade is studied; it is shown that only
                 l. 2**k exhaustive experiments are necessary to
                 determine the behavior of a cascade of l stages, each
                 having k key bits. It is concluded that the cascade of
                 random ciphers is not a random cipher. Yet, it is shown
                 that, with probability, the number of permutations
                 realizable by a cascade of l random ciphers, each
                 having k key bits, is 2**l**k. Next, it is shown that
                 two stages are not worse than one, by a simple
                 reduction of the cracking problem of any of the stages
                 to the cracking problem of the cascade. Finally, it is
                 shown that proving a nonpolynomial lower bound on the
                 cracking problem of long cascades is a hard task, since
                 such a bound implies that P does not equal NP.",

                 basis of public-key cryptosystems of knapsack type. An
                 algorithm is proposed that searches for a solution when
                 given an instance of the subset sum problem. This
                 algorithm always halts in polynomial time but does not
                 always find a solution when one exists. It converts the
                 problem to one of finding a particular short vector in
                 a lattice, and then uses a lattice basis reduction
                 algorithm to attempt to find this short vector. The
                 performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed.",

                 system (VPS) can provide secure access to telephone
                 networks, computers, rooms, and buildings. It also has
                 application in office automation systems, electronic
                 funds transfer, and 'Smart Cards' (interactive
                 computers embedded in credit-card-sized packages). As

                 the public, private, and government sectors, the voice
                 password system can provide a timely solution to the
                 security dilemma. The VPS uses modes of communication
                 available to almost everyone (the human voice and the
                 telephone). A user calls the VPS, enters his or her
                 identification number (ID) by touch-tone telephone, and
                 then speaks a password. This is usually a phrase or

                 long-lived transactions without forbidding simultaneous
                 access by other users to records modified. Earlier
                 methods presented separately by Gawlick and Reuter are
                 comparable but concentrate on ``hot-spot'' situations,
                 where even short transactions cannot lock frequently
                 accessed fields without causing bottlenecks. The Escrow
                 Method offered here is designed to support nonblocking
                 record updates by transactions that are ``long lived''
                 and thus require long periods to complete.
                 Recoverability of intermediate results prior to commit
                 thus becomes a design goal, so that updates as of a
                 given time can be guaranteed against memory or media
                 failure while still retaining the prerogative to abort.
                 This guarantee basically completes phase one of a
                 two-phase commit, and several advantages result: (1) As
                 with Gawlick's and Reuter's methods, high-concurrency
                 items in the database will not act as a bottleneck; (2)
                 transaction commit of different updates can be
                 performed asynchronously, allowing natural distributed
                 transactions; indeed, distributed transactions in the
                 presence of delayed messages or occasional line
                 disconnection become feasible in a way that we argue
                 will tie up minimal resources for the purpose intended;
                 and (3) it becomes natural to allow for human
                 interaction in the middle of a transaction without loss
                 of concurrent access or any special difficulty for the
                 application programmer. The Escrow Method, like
                 Gawlick's Fast Path and Reuter's Method, requires the
                 database system to be an ``expert'' about the type of
                 transactional updates performed, most commonly updates
                 involving incremental changes to aggregate quantities.
                 However, the Escrow Method is extendable to other types
                 of updates.",

                 broadcast messages reliably in the presence of faulty
                 processes. These protocols are run in a system that
                 consists of n processes, t of which are faulty. The
                 protocols are conducted in synchronous rounds of
                 message exchange. It is shown that, in the absence of
                 eavesdropping, without using cryptography, for any
                 epsilon greater than 0 and t equals n/(3 plus epsilon),

                 epsilon), there is a randomized protocol with O(log n)

                 the lower bound of t plus 1 rounds required for
                 deterministic protocols, and on a previous result of

                 cryptography in which the author has been working. One

                 and now in wide use for commercial cryptographic
                 applications. This is a `private key' system; the
                 communicants share a secret key, and the eavesdropper
                 will succeed if he can guess this key among its
                 quadrillions of possibilities. The other is the
                 Diffie--Hellman key exchange protocol, a typical `public
                 key' cryptographic system. Its security is based on the
                 difficulty of taking `discrete logarithms' (reversing
                 the process of exponentiation in a finite field). We
                 describe the system and some analytic attacks against

                 Technical means of protecting software from illegal
                 duplication are required, but the available means are
                 imperfect. We present protocols that enable software
                 protection, without causing substantial overhead in
                 distribution and maintenance. The protocols may be
                 implemented by a conventional cryptosystem, such as the
                 DES, or by a public key cryptosystem, such as the RSA.
                 Both implementations are proved to satisfy required
                 security criteria.",

                 encryption and message authentication are essential.
                 Both the PIN and the transaction details are at risk in
                 ATM and EFTPOS systems. The Data Encryption Algorithm
                 can be used to encrypt PINs and generate a message
                 authentication code that can be verified by the
                 receiving party. Since the same key is required for
                 both encryption and decryption, there is the problem of
                 distributing it safely to both ends of the
                 communication line. This difficulty can be resolved
                 either by using public key cryptography or by
                 implementing the Transaction Key scheme proposed in
                 Australia.",

                 public-key cryptosystems that overcomes the problems of
                 previous signature schemes used for multisignatures is
                 proposed. The principal features of this scheme are (1)
                 the length of a multisignature message is nearly
                 equivalent to that for a single signature message; (2)
                 by using a one-way hash function, multisignature
                 generation and verification are processed in an
                 efficient manner; (3) the order of signing is not
                 restricted; and (4) this scheme can be constructed on
                 any bijective public-key cryptosystem as well as the
                 RSA scheme. In addition, it is shown that the new
                 scheme is considered as safe as the public-key
                 cryptosystem used in this new scheme. Some variations

                 To facilitate sharing, the voice manager stores voice
                 on a special voice file server that is accessible via
                 the local internet. Operations for editing a passage of
                 recorded voice simply build persistent data structures
                 to represent the edited voice. These data structures,
                 implementing an abstraction called voice ropes, are
                 stored in a server database and consist of lists of
                 intervals within voice files. Clients refer to voice
                 ropes solely by reference. Interests, additional
                 persistent data structures maintained by the server,
                 provide a sort of directory service for managing the
                 voice ropes that have been created as well as a
                 reliable reference-counting mechanism, permitting the

                 protocols for authentication in distributed computing
                 systems. In this paper we motivate, set out, and
                 exemplify a logic specifically designed for this
                 analysis; we show how various protocols differ subtly
                 with respect to the required initial assumptions of the
                 participants and their final beliefs. Our formalism has
                 enabled us to isolate and express these differences
                 with a precision that was not previously possible. It
                 has drawn attention to features of protocols of which
                 we and their authors were previously unaware, and
                 allowed us to suggest improvements to the protocols.
                 The reasoning about some protocols has been
                 mechanically verified. This paper starts with an
                 informal account of the problem, goes on to explain the
                 formalism to be used, and gives examples of its
                 application to protocols from the literature, both with
                 conventional shared-key cryptography and with
                 public-key cryptography. Some of the examples are
                 chosen because of their practical importance, while
                 others serve to illustrate subtle points of the logic
                 and to explain how we use it. We discuss extensions of
                 the logic motivated by actual practice -- for example,
                 in order to account for the use of hash functions in
                 signatures. The final sections contain a formal
                 semantics of the logic and some conclusions.",

                 than the mere fact that the theorem is true. For
                 instance, to prove that a graph is Hamiltonian it
                 suffices to exhibit a Hamiltonian tour in it; however,
                 this seems to contain more knowledge than the single
                 bit Hamiltonian\slash non-Hamiltonian. In this paper a
                 computational complexity theory of the `knowledge'
                 contained in a proof is developed. Zero-knowledge
                 proofs are defined as those proofs that convey no
                 additional knowledge other than the correctness of the
                 proposition in question. Examples of zero-knowledge

                 residuosity and quadratic nonresiduosity. These are the

                 encryption protocols using machine aided formal
                 verification techniques. The properties that the
                 protocol should preserve are expressed as state
                 invariants and the theorems that must be proved to
                 guarantee that the cryptographic facility satisfies the
                 invariants are automatically generated by the
                 verification system.'' A formal specification of an
                 example system is presented, and several weaknesses
                 that were revealed by attempting to formally verify and
                 test the specification are discussed.``",

                 safe mechanisms for a variety of cryptographic
                 applications. Their main problem is the very long
                 integer arithmetic. In cryptosystems usually
                 serial-parallel multiplication is employed.
                 Serial-parallel multiplication slows down the
                 encryption to the order of k, where k is log[subscript
                 2]n, and n is the modulus. The approach presented in
                 this paper demonstrates a method of using parallel
                 multiplication schemes at the order of log(k) in
                 combination with incomplete modulus reduction. This
                 method calls for redundant number representations. With
                 this background, the problem of designing a quasi
                 optimal scheme fitting into a defined chip area is
                 elaborated. The two methods, the partial parallel
                 multiplication in redundant number representations and
                 incomplete modulus reduction at fully completed
                 multiplication steps only, seem to allow for RSA

                 secure and reliable storage of information in computer

  abstract =     "Andrew is a distributed computing environment that is
                 a synthesis of the personal computing and timesharing
                 paradigms. When mature, it is expected to encompass
                 over 5,000 workstations spanning the Carnegie Mellon
                 University campus. This paper examines the security
                 issues that arise in such an environment and describes
                 the mechanisms that have been developed to address
                 them. These mechanisms include the logical and physical
                 separation of servers and clients, support for secure
                 communication at the remote procedure call level, a
                 distributed authentication service, a file-protection
                 scheme that combines access lists with UNIX mode bits,
                 and the use of encryption as a basic building block.
                 The paper also discusses the assumptions underlying
                 security in Andrew and analyzes the vulnerability of
                 the system. Usage experience reveals that resource
                 control, particularly of workstation CPU cycles, is
                 more important than originally anticipated and that the
                 mechanisms available to address this issue are
                 rudimentary.",
