    \par
This book is a comprehensive exposition of the theory of
    linear and integer programming and is complementing the more
    practically oriented books. It is intended for graduate students
    as an introduction and for researchers who need a thorough reference
    work. The author has been able to collect the necessary basic
    theory and the main results in the field. The historical remarks
    make the book valuable as a reference for readers interested
    in mathematical history. \par
The book is divided into four
    main parts and a brief general introduction. In the introductionary
    part some notations and basic principles from linear algebra,
    matrix theory, graph theory, and Euclidean geometry are described.
    In addition, a brief overview of complexity theory is given.
    \par
The first main part of the book is concerned with results
    from linear algebra needed for solving linear and integer programs.
    The emphasis is on some less well-known facts on sizes and complexity
    in linear algebra. Here especially the Gaussian elimination method
    is discussed. \par
The second main part consists of three chapters
    and deals with lattices and linear Diophantine equations. In
    the first chapter of this part the theoretical results based
    mainly on the works of Hermite and Minkowski on lattices and
    linear Diophantine equations are reviewed. Especially the Hermite
    normal form of a matrix is presented. The second chapter is concerned
    with the Euclidean algorithm for finding the g.c.d., which can
    be used to get polynomial time algorithms for solving one linear
    Diophantine equation. Also the extension to systems of linear
    Diophantine equations is described. The last chapter of this
    part is devoted to the continued fraction methods for approximating
    a real number by rational numbers of low denominator. In addition,
    Lovasz's basic reduction method for lattices is discussed. \par
Part
    three, entitled ``Polyhedra, linear inequalities, and linear
    programming'' consists of nine chapters. In the first chapter
    of this part the fundamental results due to Farkas, Minkowski,
    Caratheodory and Weyl are reviewed. These results constitute
    the basis for working on polyhedra, linear inequalities and linear
    programming. The second chapter is devoted to the geometric structure
    of polyhedra. Topics include faces, facets, vertices, extremal
    rays, the characteristic cone, and the decomposition of polyhedra.
    The third chapter deals with polarity and with blocking and anti-blocking
    polyhedra. In the fourth chapter the theoretical complexity of
    linear inequalities and linear programming is discussed. The
    basic simplex method for linear programming is presented in the
    fifth chapter. Further methods, like the primal-dual methods,
    the Fourier-Motzkin elimination method and the relaxation method
    are treated in the sixth chapter. In the seventh chapter the
    Ellipsoid method and Khachiyan's polynomial time algorithm is
    presented, while in the eighth chapter the Ellipsoid method is
    extended to allow applications to combinatorial optimization
    problems. The last chapter of part three briefly discusses Karmarkar's
    polynomial-time algorithm, Tardos' work on strongly polynomial
    algorithms and Megiddo's linear-time algorithm for linear programming
    in fixed dimensions. \par
The last part of the book is about
    integer linear programming and consists also of nine chapters.
    In the first chapter of this part a general introduction to integer
    linear programming is given and some polyhedral aspects of integer
    linear programming are discussed. The second chapter shows that
    integer linear programming belongs to NP. Also some sensitivity
    and proximity results are given. The third chapter deals with
    the complexity status of integer linear programming (ILP). It
    is shown that ILP is NP-complete. Also Lenstra's algorithm is
    described which is for each fixed number of variables a polynomial-time
    method. In Chapter four fundamental properties and examples of
    totally unimodular matrices are presented, and the fifth chapter
    gives a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing total unimodularity.
    The sixth chapter contains some further theory related to total
    unimodularity. In Chapter seven the theory of total dual integrality
    introduced by Edmonds and Giles is discussed. We get that certain
    ILPs have integral optimum solutions if their duals have integral
    optimum solutions. In the eighth chapter the theory of cutting
    planes based on work of Gomory and Chvatal is presented. The
    last chapter surveys some further methods in integer linear programming,
    like branch and bound methods, Lagrangean relaxation and Benders
    decomposition. \par
An excellent bibliography is at the end
    of the book. However, since the book was first published in 1986
    some of the newer developments in the area are missing in the
    bibliography as well as in the main text.}",
