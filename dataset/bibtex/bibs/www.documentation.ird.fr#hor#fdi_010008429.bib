  abstract = {{T}he extent and geographical distribution of degraded lands like salt-affected lands, areas under soil erosion and shifting cultivation, waterlogged areas, and ravines, form an essential input for planning reclamation/conservation programmes. {R}emote sensing satellites provide timely, accurate and reliable data on degraded lands at definite time intervals in a cost effective manner. {E}xperiments have been carried out to map and monitor the areas with erosion and shifting cultivation and salt-affected soils, using remotely sensed data from {L}andsat {MSS}, {TM} and {I}ndian {R}emote {S}ensing satellite ({IRS}) sensors. {T}he details of the methodology employed to derive information from remotely sensed data on above mentioned degraded lands and the results of the experiment are discussed in this paper. {T}he salt-affected soils of {I}ndia have been mapped for the whole country at 1:250,000 scale by the {N}ational {R}emote {S}ensing {A}gency ({H}yderabad) in association with {N}ational organisations like {N}ational {B}ureau of {S}oil {S}urvey and {L}and {U}se planning, {A}ll {I}ndia {S}oil and {L}and use {S}urvey and provincial soil survey organisations and {A}gricultural {U}niversities. {T}he changes in the spatial extent of eroded and shifting cultivation areas and salt-affected soils are also studied using multi-temporal satellite data. {T}he development of satellite image processing, artificial intelligence, global positioning system and mathematical morphology has promoted the use of {GIS} technology for storage, retrieval, management and analysis of spatial data as well as solving decision making problems. {T}he information generated on degraded lands through remote sensing data and other ancillary information available are stored in {GIS} to perform integrated analysis.
