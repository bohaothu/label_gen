 A new algorithm for testing satisfiability of propositional formulas in 
 conjunctive normal form (CNF) is described.  It applies reasoning in the
 form of certain resolution operations, and identification of equivalent
 literals.  Resolution produces growth in the size of the formula, but within
 a global quadratic bound; most previous methods avoid operations that
 produce any growth, and generally do not identify equivalent literals.
 Computational experience so far suggests that the method does substantially
 less "guessing" than previously reported algorithms, while keeping a
 polynomial time bound on the work done between guesses.  However, the
 time trade-off between reasoning and guessing is not yet clear.
