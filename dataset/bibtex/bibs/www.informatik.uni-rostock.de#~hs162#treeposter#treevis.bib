  title = {Trevis: A context tree visualization and analysis framework and its
	use for classifying performance failure reports},
  pages = {73--82},
  abstract = {When developers profile their applications to identify performance
	problems, they normally use profilers producing calling context trees.
	A calling context tree (CCT) represents the caller-callee relationships
	of a program. A dynamically collected CCT provides method coverage
	information. The CCTs produced by profilers also include method hotness
	information. Trevis, our context tree visualization and analysis
	framework, allows users to visualize, compare, cluster, and intersect
	CCTs produced by profilers. We evaluate Trevis in the context of
	a novel profiling tool called FlyBy. FlyBy runs transparently on
	an end-user's computer and continuously samples the applications'
	call stack. When the user perceives the application as sluggish,
	she presses a "Was Slow!" button to tell FlyBy to file a performance
	failure report. The report contains the CCT based on the call stack
	samples FlyBy gathered over the last few seconds before the user
	pressed the button. We show how Trevis allows us to visualize and
	classify FlyBy bug reports.},

	if the visualization is to be done on massmarket personal computers,

	partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles.
	Each region represents a node of T and the area of each region is
	proportional to the weight of the corresponding node. An important
	quality criterium for treemaps is the aspect ratio of its regions.
	Unfortunately, one cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are
	restricted to be rectangles. Hence Onak and Sidiropoulos introduced
	polygonal partitions, which use convex polygons. We are the first
	to obtain convex partitions with optimal aspect ratio O(depth(T)).
	We also consider the important special case that depth(T)=1, that

	or forest in an X Window, the roots on the left and the leaf processes
	(those with no children) on the right. The status of each process
	running, sleeping, stopped, etc., can be indicated by different colors.
	Different users can appear as different colors too. Process selection
	can be made per user, all users, or through a regular-expression
	pattern. In contrast to the terminal-based pstree or tree-widget
	based programs, the tree display uses diagonal lines, and effort
	is made to effectively use the full 2-dimensional area of the screen
	by balancing levels and centering the children of a node between
	their parent. A goal of the program is to give an idea of what's
	going on graphically as things may be constantly changing. Therefore
	the display algorithm tries to keep processes close to their parents
	to reduce the amount of scrolling to see localized process creation
	and destruction. Some effort is also given to make sure that the
	tree layout doesn't get wildly reorganized when there are small or
	localized changes. This makes it easier for the eye to pick up and
	recognize the changes over a potentially large display area. We describe
	here criteria for tree animations such as this one and how the xps
	layout algorithm works. There are some other miscellaneous features
	of xps. One can select viewing the processes by a single user, a
	regular expression for users, by all users, and perhaps show kernel
	processes. One can click on a process to get more information (via
	ps or a user-specified program) about that process, send a signal,
	or set the process priority, assuming you have the permission to
	do so. Since programs of this ilk can consume a bit of CPU on their
	own, some effort has been made to turn off the update process when
	the program is iconified or not visible for some other reason such
	as being obscured by another window. Some attention has been paid
	to make algorithm display fairly fast in most situations, although
	it has to be admitted that this comes sometimes at the expense of
	a nicer layout.},

	We conducted a user study with 30 subjects in that we compared IPTPs

  abstract = {The small screens on increasingly used mobile devices challenge the
	traditional visualization methods designed for desktops. This paper
	presents a method called "Radial Edgeless Tree" (RELT) for visualizing
	trees in a 2-dimensional space. It combines the existing connection
	tree drawing with the space-filling approach to achieve the efficient
	display of trees in a small geometrical area, such as the screen
	that are commonly used in mobile devices. We recursively calculate
	a set of non-overlapped polygonal nodes that are adjacent in the
	hierarchical manner. Thus, the display space is fully used for displaying
	nodes, while the hierarchical relationships among the nodes are presented
	by the adjacency (or boundary-sharing) of the nodes. It is different
	from the other traditional connection approaches that use a node-link
	diagram to present the parent-child relationships which waste the
	display space. The hierarchy spreads from north-west to south-east
	in a top-down manner which naturally follows the traditional way
	of human perception of hierarchies. We discuss the characteristics,
	advantages and limitations of this new technique and suggestions

	Our work is motivated by the fact that in spite of years of research
	and practice, software development and maintenance are still time
	and resource consuming, and high-risk activities. The most important
	reason in our opinion is the complexity of many phenomena related
	to software, such as its evolution and its reliability. In fact,
	there is very little theory explaining them. Today, we have a unique
	opportunity to empirically study these phenomena, thanks to large
	sets of software data available through open-source programs and
	open repositories. Automatic analysis techniques, such as statistics
	and machine learning, are usually limited when studying phenomena
	with unknown or poorly-understood influence factors. We claim that
	hybrid techniques that combine automatic analysis with human expertise
	through visualization are excellent alternatives to them. In this
	paper, we propose a visualization framework that supports quality

	of an appropriate layout, the use of the interactions that make it

	of their apparent simplicity, the displaying of a tree in 3D can
	also introduce new problems that can be overcome with the appropriate
	interactions. So, we have developed a new visualization technique
	for 3D tree visualization; this includes the design of a new tree

	that can be applied on this representation. This technique allows
	representing hierarchical structures to different levels of detail

	In information visualization, drawing trees based on fractal theory
	also plays an interesting role as the so-called balloon drawing of

	organized data in a geographic context. In contrast to existing techniques,
	our visualization emphasizes the hierarchical relationships in the
	data by depicting them in a standard tree format that takes advantage
	of many fundamental perceptual properties. Our technique allows users
	to define a geographic axis and visualize how well a tree correlates
	with the ordering of geographical locations along this axis. This
	is accomplished by finding the ordering of leaf nodes, subject to
	the constraints of the tree topology, which minimizes the number
	of crossings that occur between lines that connect leaf nodes to
	their associated geographic locations. In this optimal layout, any
	crossings that occur between these lines indicate discordance between
	the topology of the tree and the user defined geographic axis. We
	have developed a branch-and-bound algorithm that allows optimal leaf
	orderings to be determined quickly enough to support interactive
	exploration of different geographic axes even for large multifurcating
	hierarchies. The quantitative nature of our visualization has allowed
	us to specify a permutation test for determining if the relationship
	between a tree topology and a geographic axis is statistically significant.
	In this paper, the utility of our visualization is demonstrated on

	create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition,
	continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized

	A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance

  abstract = {Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The
	input is a weighted tree $\tree$ where the weight of each node is
	the sum of the weights of its children. A treemap for $\tree$ is
	a hierarchical partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions,
	usually rectangles. Each region represents a node of $\tree$ and
	the area of each region is proportional to the weight of the corresponding
	node. An important quality criterium for treemaps is the aspect ratio
	of its regions. Unfortunately, one cannot bound the aspect ratio
	if the regions are restricted to be rectangles. Hence Onak and Sidiropoulos
	in SoCG 2008 introduced \emph{polygonal partitions}, which use convex
	polygons. We are the first to obtain convex partitions with optimal
	aspect ratio $O(\depth(\tree))$. Furthermore, we consider rectilinear
	partitions, which retain more of the schematized flavor of standard
	rectangular treemaps. Our rectilinear treemaps have constant aspect

	minimize the aspect ratio of a rectangular single-level treemap.
	On the positive side we show how to construct rectilinear and convex
	single-level treemaps with constant aspect ratio. Our rectilinear
	single-level treemaps use only rectangles and L-shapes and have aspect
	ratio at most $2 + 2 \sqrt{3}/3$. The convex version uses four different

	widths of the labels and take them into account for the positioning
	of the nodes; on the other hand, all the textual parts of the document
	can be treated uniformly. Second, TreeTeX can be trivially ported

	visualizing hierarchical data. And it enables user to compare nodes
	in the same level and to learn certain relationship between adjacent
	levels. However, treemap layout is limited to visualize multi-dimensional
	hierarchical data in which the hierarchy is unfixed and complex,
	especially when the hierarchy is an arbitrary graph. Considering
	this problem, we present a novel extension called magic treemap cube,
	which improves the layout and has a good performance on visualizing
	unfixed (cross-level) and complex data, inverting hierarchy without
	reorganizing the structure, and enabling users to easily compare
	among treemaps. The magic treemap cube is a three-dimensional regular
	hexahedron whose six faces are covered by six different treemaps.
	Each dimension of the magic treemap cube is a hierarchy structure
	specified by users according to a hierarchical division of visualization
	information. With the treemap algorithm, tagcloud and mapping rules,
	the treemaps are automatically controlled by permutations of three
	dimensions of the cube. Users could observe the six correlative treemaps
	respectively by rotating the magic treemap cube in three dimensional
	Cartesian coordinate. And this magic treemap cube can be unfolded
	into a tiled treemap in 2D Cartesian coordinate for users-friendly
	comparison of each treemap. Meanwhile, a merging operation to the
	tiled treemap is proposed to not only compare two treemaps through
	the adjacency relations among faces but also provide more information.

	OlympicVis) has been implemented to visualize the Beijing 2008 Olympic
	Games information, which involves multi-dimensional hierarchy and

	MetNetGE is an interactive visualization tool based on the Google

	hundreds of pathways in a complex graph, MetNetGE gives an overview
	of the network using the hierarchical pathway ontology using a novel
	layout, called the Enhanced Radial Space-Filling (ERSF) approach
	that allows the network to be summarized compactly. The non-tree
	edges in the pathway or gene ontology, which represent pathways or
	genes that belong to multiple categories, are linked using orbital
	connections in a third dimension. Biologists can easily identify
	highly activated pathways or gene ontology categories by mapping

	and overrepresentation values onto the visualization. After identifying
	such pathways, biologists can focus on the corresponding region to

	circle. Finally, layout of subtrees are assembled together to form

	workload from the cognitive to the perceptual systems, taking advantage
	of the human visual processing system to increase the bandwidth of

	for the simultaneous presentation of thousands of data records, as

	let users see the forest and the trees by providing local detail
	in the context of a global overview, providing a visually engaging
	environment in which to analyze, search, explore and manipulate large
	hierarchical and categorical data spaces. The treemap method of hierarchical
	visualization, at its core, is based on the property of containment.
	This property of containment is a fundamental idea which powerfully
	encapsulates many of our reasons for constructing information hierarchies.
	All members of the treemap family of algorithms partition multi-dimensional
	display spaces based on weighted hierarchical data sets. In addition
	to generating treemaps and standard traditional hierarchical diagrams,
	the treemap algorithms extend non-hierarchical techniques such as
	bar and pie charts into the domain of hierarchical presentation.
	Treemap algorithms can be used to generate bar charts, outlines,
	traditional 2-D node and link diagrams, pie charts, cone trees, cam
	trees, drum trees, etc. Generating existing diagrams via treemap
	transformations is an excercise meant to show the power, ease, and
	generality with which alternative presentations can be generated
	from the basic treemap algorithms. Controlled experiments with novice
	treemap users and real data highlight the strengths of treemaps and
	provide direction for improvement. Experimental results show that
	treemaps are a powerful visualization tool for large data sets, significantly
	reducing user performance times for global comparison tasks. Effective
	visualizations of large data sets can help users gain insight into
	relevant features of the data, construct accurate mental models of
	the information, and locate regions of particular interest. Treemaps
	are based on simple, fundamental ideas, but they are the building

	onto a display region. The chosen mapping provides a fisheye distortion
	that supports a smooth blending of focus and context. We have deveoped
	effective procedures for manipulating the focus using pointer clicks
	as well as interactive dragging and for smoothly animating transitions
	across such manipulation. Enhancements to the core mechanisms provide
	support for multiple foci, control of the tradeoff between node density
	and node display space, and for visualizing graphs by transforming

	various issues related to balloon drawings of rooted trees from the

	optimize the angular resolution and the aspect ratio for the balloon
	drawings of rooted unordered trees. For the case of ordered trees
	for which the center of the enclosing circle of a subtree need not
	coincide with the root of the subtree, flipping the drawing of a

	might change both the aspect ratio and the angular resolution of
	the drawing. We show that optimizing the angular resolution as well
	as the aspect ratio with respect to this type of rooted ordered trees
	is reducible to the perfect matching problem for bipartite graphs,
	which is solvable in polynomial time. In addition, a related problem
	concerning the optimization of the drawing area can be modelled as
	a specific type of nonlinear programming for which there exist several
	robust algorithms in practice. With a slight modification to the

	backbone Internet routers connect with 70,000 other hosts, mid-sized
	Web servers handle between 20,000 and 200,000 hyperlinked documents,
	and dictionaries contain millions of words defined in terms of each
	other. Computational manipulation of such large graphs is common,
	but previous tools for graph visualization have been limited to datasets
	of a few thousand nodes. Visual depictions of graphs and networks
	are external representations that exploit human visual processing
	to reduce the cognitive load of many tasks that require understanding
	of global or local structure. We assert that the two key advantages
	of computer-based systems for information visualization over traditional
	paper-based visual exposition are interactivity and scalability.
	We also argue that designing visualization software by taking the
	characteristics of a target user's task domain into account leads
	to systems that are more effective and scale to larger datasets than
	previous work. This thesis contains a detailed analysis of three
	specialized systems for the interactive exploration of large graphs,
	relating the intended tasks to the spatial layout and visual encoding
	choices. We present two novel algorithms for specialized layout and
	drawing that use quite different visual metaphors. The H3 system
	for visualizing the hyperlink structures of web sites scales to datasets
	of over 100,000 nodes by using a carefully chosen spanning tree as
	the layout backbone, 3D hyperbolic geometry for a Focus+Context view,
	and provides a fluid interactive experience through guaranteed frame
	rate drawing. The Constellation system features a highly specialized
	2D layout intended to spatially encode domain-specific information
	for computational linguists checking the plausibility of a large
	semantic network created from dictionaries. The Planet Multicast
	system for displaying the tunnel topology of the Internet's multicast
	backbone provides a literal 3D geographic layout of arcs on a globe
	to help MBone maintainers find misconfigured long-distance tunnels.
	Each of these three systems provides a very different view of the
	graph structure, and we evaluate their efficacy for the intended
	task. We generalize these findings in our analysis of the importance

	of two components: visualization and navigation. Visualization uses
	a fast enclosure+connection method to calculate the geometrical layout
	for the display of large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space.
	Our technique uses a rectangular division algorithm for recursively
	positioning the graph. This visualization aims to maximize the utilization
	of display space while retaining a good geometrical layout as well
	as a clear (explicit) presentation of the hierarchical structure
	of graphs. This paper also presents an experimental evaluation of
	EncCon's layout algorithm. Besides the layout algorithm, EncCon uses
	a new focus+context viewing technique for the navigation of large
	hierarchies. We use the zooming+layering concept to achieve the focus+context
	viewing, rather than the traditional enlarge+embedded concept, which
	is used by most of the available focus+context techniques. Technically,
	it employs semi-transparency to achieve the display of two layers
	of information in z-coordination at the same visualization. Both
	context view and detail view are drawn at two separate layers. These
	layers are then displayed in an overlapped manner at the same physical

	To be able to handle the navigation of large hierarchies, we use

	moved to a primary viewing position, each of the cones along the
	path from the indicated node to the root node is rotated in the direction
	that most directly moves the indicated node to the primary viewing
	position. Each node can include a selectable unit for indicating

	coordinates and the appropriate data from the array. The base of

	such information, are ubiquitous. Although much research effort has
	been spent on finding useful representations for hierarchies, visualising
	large hierarchies is still a difficult topic. One of the difficulties
	is how to handle the ever increasing scale of hierarchies. Another
	is how to enable the user to focus on multiple selections of interest
	while maintaining context. This paper describes a hierarchy visualisation
	technique called FlexTree to address these problems. It contains
	some important features that have not been exploited so far. A profile
	or contour unique to the hierarchy being visualised can be viewed
	in a bar chart layout. A normalised view of a common attribute of
	all nodes can be selected by the user. Multiple foci are consistently
	accessible within a global context through interaction. Furthermore
	it can handle a large hierarchy that contains 10,000 nodes in a PC
	environment. This technique has been applied to visualise computer
	file system structures and decision trees from data mining results.
	The results from informal user evaluations against these two applications
	are also presented. User feedback suggests that FlexTree is suitable
	for visualising large decision trees.},

	relationship among them, and their shape and size, where should each
	node be positioned for optimal aesthetic effect? This algorithm determines
	the positions of the nodes for any arbitrary general tree. It is
	the most desirable positioning with respect to certain widely-accepted
	heuristics. The positioning, specified in x, y co-ordinates, minimizes
	the width of the tree. In a general tree, there is no limit on the
	number of offspring per node; this contrasts with binary and ternary
	trees, for example, which are trees with a limit of two and three
	offspring per node. This algorithm operates in time O(N), where N
	is the number of nodes in the tree. Previously, most tree drawings
	have been positioned by the sure hand of a human graphic designer.
	Many computer-generated positionings have been either trivial or
	contained irregularities. Earlier work by Wetherell and Shannon1
	and Tilford,2 upon which this algorithm builds, failed to position
	the interior nodes of some trees correctly. The algorithm presented
	here correctly positions a tree's node using only two passes. It
	also handles several practical considerations: alternative orientations
	of the tree, variable node sizes and out-of-bounds conditions. Radack,
	also building on Tilford's work, has solved this same problem with

  abstract = {Interactive dynamic maps (IDMs) help users interactively explore webs
	of hypermedia documents. IDMs provide automatically-generated abstract
	graphical views at different levels of granularity. Visual cues give
	users a better understanding of the content of the web, which results
	in better navigation control and more accurate and effective expressions
	of queries. IDMs consist of: topic maps, which provide visual abstractions
	of the semantic content of a web of documents and document maps,
	which provide visual abstractions of subsets of documents. The major
	contributions of this work include (1) automatic techniques for building
	maps directly from a web of documents, including extraction of semantic
	content and use of a spatial metaphor for generating layout and filling
	space, (2) a direct manipulation interaction paradigm for exploring
	webs of documents, using maps and an integrated graphical query language,
	and (3) the ability to use the maps themselves as documents that
	can be customized, stored in a library and shared among users.},

  isbn = {9781449379872},
  abstract = {Visualization is the graphic presentation of data -- portrayals meant
	to reveal complex information at a glance. Think of the familiar
	map of the New York City subway system, or a diagram of the human
	brain. Successful visualizations are beautiful not only for their
	aesthetic design, but also for elegant layers of detail that efficiently
	generate insight and new understanding. This book examines the methods
	of two dozen visualization experts who approach their projects from
	a variety of perspectives -- as artists, designers, commentators,
	scientists, analysts, statisticians, and more. Together they demonstrate
	how visualization can help us make sense of the world. Contributors
	include: Nick Bilton, Michael E. Driscoll, Jonathan Feinberg, Danyel
	Fisher, Jessica Hagy, Gregor Hochmuth, Todd Holloway, Noah Iliinsky,
	Eddie Jabbour, Valdean Klump, Aaron Koblin, Robert Kosara, Valdis
