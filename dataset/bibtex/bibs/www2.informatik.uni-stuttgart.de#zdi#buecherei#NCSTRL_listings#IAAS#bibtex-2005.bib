   abstract = {This document presents a Services Research Roadmap that launches four pivotal,
      inherently related, research themes to Service-Oriented Computing (SOC):
      service foundations, service composition, service management and monitoring and
      service-oriented engineering. Each theme is introduced briefly from a
      technology, state of the art and scientific challenges standpoint. From the
      technology standpoint a comprehensive review of state of the art, standards,
      and current research activities in each key area is provided. From the state of
      the art the major open problems and bottlenecks to progress are identified.
      During the during seminar each core theme was initially introduced by a leading
      expert in the field who described the state of the art and highlighting open
      problems and important research topics for the SOC community to work on in the
      future. These experts were then asked to coordinate parallel workgroups that
      were entrusted with an in-depth analysis of the research opportunities and
      needs in the respective theme. The findings presented in this summary report
      build on the advice of those panels of experts from industry and academia who
      participated in this Dagstuhl Seminar and met at other occasions during the
      past three years, e.g., at the International Conference on Service Oriented
      Computing (ICSOC, see www.icsoc.org). These experts represent many disciplines
      including distributed computing, database and information systems, software
      engineering, computer architectures and middleware and knowledge
      representation.},

   abstract = {WS-coordination and WS-CF provide support for distributed activities that
      require coordination in an environment of Web services. Both specifications are
      generic coordination frameworks, not specific for any application. Despite
      their generic character, up to now only transactional protocols have been
      defined, which leverage these coordination frameworks. In this work we map a
      distributed activity, that it is not related to transactions, onto the
      coordination model underlying WS-coordination and WS-CF. Consequently we
      identify the necessary characteristics of a distributed activity that leverages
      the coordination frameworks of WS-coordination and WS-CF. We also examine
      limits of these coordination frameworks and suggest additional mechanisms where
      support for coordination in particular use cases is not sufficient. In contrast
      to coordinating distributed transactions, additional problems could arise when
      other types of activities are subject to coordination. These problems are
      studied, classified and reviewed in conjunction with the architectural
      differences of WS-coordination and WS-CF.},

   abstract = {The existing Web service flow (WS-flow) technologies enable both static and
      dynamic binding of participating Web services (WSs) on the process model level.
      Adaptability on per-instance basis is not sufficiently supported and therefore
      must be addressed to improve process flexibility upon changes in the
      environment. Ad-hoc process instance changes can be enabled by swapping
      participating WS instances, by modifying port types of the partners to be
      invoked, and by changing process logic. In this work, we address the problem of
      dynamic binding of WSs to WS-flow instances at run time, i.e. the ability to
      exchange a WS instance participating in a WS-flow instance with an alternative
      one. The problem is additionally complicated by the fact that the execution of
      a process depends on its deployment. We describe the ``find and bind'' mechanism,
      and we show its representation as a BPEL extension. We discuss the benefits
      that could be gained and the disadvantages it brings in. The mechanism extends
      and improves the existing process technologies. It facilitates a precisely
      controlled policy-based selection of WSs at run time and also provides for
      process instance repair, while maintaining simplicity. We also discuss a
      prototypical implementation of the presented functionality.},

      IT-supported business operations from a business expert's view rather than from
      a technical perspective. However, the degree of mechanization in BPM is still
      very limited, creating inertia in the necessary evolution and dynamics of
      business processes, and BPM does not provide a truly unified view on the
      process space of an organization. We trace back the problem of mechanization of
      BPM to an ontological one, i.e. the lack of machine-accessible semantics, and
      argue that the modeling constructs of semantic Web services frameworks,
      especially WSMO, are a natural fit to creating such a representation. As a
      consequence, we propose to combine SWS and BPM and create one consolidated
      technology, which we call semantic business process management (SBPM).},
