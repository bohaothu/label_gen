  abstract = 	 "The string statistics problem consists of
                  preprocessing a string of length~$n$ such that
                  given a query pattern of length~$m$, the
                  maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences
                  of the query pattern in the string can be
                  reported efficiently. Apostolico and Preparata
                  introduced the minimal augmented suffix tree
                  (MAST) as a data structure for the string
                  statistics problem, and showed how to construct
                  the MAST in time ${\cal O}(n\log^2 n)$ and how
                  it supports queries in time~${\cal O}(m)$ for
                  constant sized alphabets. A subsequent theorem
                  by Fraenkel and Simpson stating that a string
                  has at most a linear number of distinct squares
                  implies that the MAST requires space~${\cal
                  O}(n)$. In this paper we improve the
                  construction time for the MAST to ${\cal
                  O}(n\log n)$ by extending the algorithm of
                  Apostolico and Preparata to exploit properties
                  of efficient joining and splitting of search
                  trees together with a refined analysis",
