  abstract = {We present a GUI-based {\em C++} toolbox that allows for building
	distributed, multi-modal context recognition systems by plugging
	together reusable, parameterizable components. The goals of the toolbox
	are to simplify the steps from prototypes to online implementations
	on low-power mobile devices, facilitate portability between platforms
	and foster easy adaptation and extensibility. The main features of
	the toolbox we focus on here are a set of parameterizable algorithms
	including different filters, feature computations and classifiers,
	a runtime environment that supports complex synchronous and asynchronous
	data flows, encapsulation of hardware-specific aspects including
	sensors and data types (e.g., int vs.~float), and the ability to
	outsource parts of the computation to remote devices. In addition,
	components are provided for group-wise, event-based sensor synchronization
	and data labeling. We describe the architecture of the toolbox and
	illustrate its functionality on two case studies that are part of
	the downloadable distribution.},
