	Volume = {277},
	Year = {1997},
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence and determinants of data-withholding behaviors among academic life scientists. DESIGN: Mailed survey of 3394 life science faculty in the 50 universities that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1993. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2167 faculty responded to the survey, a 64% response rate. OUTCOME MEASURES: Whether respondents delayed publication of their research results for more than 6 months and whether respondents refused to share research results with other university scientists in the last 3 years. RESULTS: A total of 410 respondents (19.8%) reported that publication of their research results had been delayed by more than 6 months at least once in the last 3 years to allow for patent application, to protect their scientific lead, to slow the dissemination of undesired results, to allow time to negotiate a patent, or to resolve disputes over the ownership of intellectual property. Also, 181 respondents (8.9%) reported refusing to share research results with other university scientists in the last 3 years. In multivariate analysis, participation in an academic-industry research relationship and engagement in the commercialization of university research were significantly associated with delays in publication. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 1.34 (1.07-1.59) and 3.15 (2.88-3.41), respectively. Variables associated with refusing to share results were conducting research similar to the Human Genome Project (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.75-2.42), publication rate (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03), and engagement in commercialization of research (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 2.08-2.82). CONCLUSIONS: Withholding of research results is not a widespread phenomenon among life-science researchers. However, withholding is more common among the most productive and entrepreneurial faculty. These results also suggest that data withholding has affected a significant number of life-science faculty and further study on data-withholding practices is suggested.}}

	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To better understand the variety and prevalence of data withholding in genetics and the other life sciences and to explore factors associated with these behaviors. METHOD: In 2000, a sample of 2,893 geneticists and other life scientists (OLS) at the 100 most research-intensive universities in the United States were surveyed concerning data withholding and sharing. The instrument was developed and pretested in 1999. The two primary outcome measures were withholding in verbal exchanges with colleagues about unpublished research (verbal withholding) and withholding as part of the publishing process (publishing withholding). The independent variables related to the personal characteristics, research characteristics of faculty, and previous experience with data withholding. RESULTS: A total of 1,849 faculty responded (64\%): 1,240 geneticists and 600 OLS. Forty-four percent of geneticists and 32\% of OLS reported participating in any one of 13 forms of data withholding in the three previous years. Publishing withholding (geneticists 35\%, OLS 25\%) was more frequent than verbal withholding (geneticists 23\%, OLS 12\%). In multivariate analyses, male gender, participation in relationships with industry, mentors' discouraging data sharing, receipt of formal instruction in data sharing, and negative past experience with sharing were significantly associated with either verbal or publishing withholding among either geneticists or OLS. CONCLUSIONS: Data withholding is common in biomedical science, takes multiple forms, is influenced by a variety of characteristics of investigators and their training, and varies by field of science. Encouraging openness during the formative experiences of young investigators may be critical to increased data sharing, but the effects of formal training do not appear straightforward.}}

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: The free and open sharing of information, data, and materials regarding published research is vital to the replication of published results, the efficient advancement of science, and the education of students. Yet in daily practice, the ideal of free sharing is often breached. OBJECTIVE: To understand the nature, extent, and consequences of data withholding in academic genetics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mailed survey (March-July 2000) of geneticists and other life scientists in the 100 US universities that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1998. Of a potential 3000 respondents, 2893 were eligible and 1849 responded, yielding an overall response rate of 64\%. We analyzed a subsample of 1240 self-identified geneticists and made a limited number of comparisons with 600 self-identified nongeneticists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of faculty who made requests for data that were denied; percentage of respondents who denied requests; influences on and consequences of withholding data; and changes over time in perceived willingness to share data. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of geneticists who asked other faculty for additional information, data, or materials regarding published research reported that at least 1 of their requests had been denied in the preceding 3 years. Ten percent of all postpublication requests for additional information were denied. Because they were denied access to data, 28\% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research. Twelve percent said that in the previous 3 years, they had denied another academician's request for data concerning published results. Among geneticists who said they had intentionally withheld data regarding their published work, 80\% reported that it required too much effort to produce the materials or information; 64\%, that they were protecting the ability of a graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, or junior faculty member to publish; and 53\%, that they were protecting their own ability to publish. Thirty-five percent of geneticists said that sharing had decreased during the last decade; 14\%, that sharing had increased. Geneticists were as likely as other life scientists to deny others' requests (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-2.40) and to have their own requests denied (OR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.69-1.40). However, other life scientists were less likely to report that withholding had a negative impact on their own research as well as their field of research. CONCLUSIONS: Data withholding occurs in academic genetics and it affects essential scientific activities such as the ability to confirm published results. Lack of resources and issues of scientific priority may play an important role in scientists' decisions to withhold data, materials, and information from other academic geneticists.}}

Performance was improved by accelerating the loading of central data pages such as the omnibus Gene page, by rationalizing internal data structures and software for greater portability, and by making the Genome Browser highly customizable in how it views and exports genomic subsequences. Arbitrarily complex, user-specified queries are now possible through Textpresso (for all available literature) and through WormMart (for most genomic data). Biological content was enriched by reconciling all available cDNA and expressed sequence tag data with gene predictions, clarifying single nucleotide polymorphism and RNAi sites, and summarizing known functions for most genes studied in this organism.}}

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide the first national data on the nature, extent, and consequences of withholding among life science trainees. METHOD: In 2003, the authors surveyed 1,077 second-year doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in life sciences at 50 U.S. universities, with a comparison group of trainees in computer science and chemical engineering. The study variables examined trainees' exposure to and the consequences of data withholding. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-six trainees (23.0\%) reported that they had asked for and been denied access to information, data, materials, or programming associated with published research and 221 (20.6\%) to unpublished research. Eighty-five trainees (7.9\%) reported that they had denied another academic scientist's request(s) related to their own published research. Five hundred thirty-three trainees (50.8\%) reported that withholding had had a negative effect on the progress of their research, 508 (48.5\%) on the rate of discovery in their lab/research group, 472 (45.0\%) on the quality of their relationships with academic scientists, 346 (33.0\%) on the quality of their education, and 299 (28.5\%) on the level of communication in their lab/research group. Trainees denied access to research were significantly more likely to report that data withholding had had a negative effect on several aspects of the educational experience. CONCLUSIONS: Data withholding had demonstrated negative effects on trainees. The life sciences, more so than chemical engineering or computer science, will have to address this issue among its trainees. Failure to do so could result in delayed research, inefficient training, and a culture of withholding among future life scientists.}}
