%%%                        NB: Since the SIAM journals introduced
%%%                        electronic prepublication in the late 1990s,
%%%                        the volume/year relationships have become
%%%                        blurred, because the SIAM Web
%%%                        tables-of-contents files do not record the
%%%                        publication year.  I am working with SIAM to
%%%                        find a solution to this problem.

                 one-dimensional inverse problem of reflection

                 inverse problem for a first order 2 multiplied by 2
                 hyperbolic system. The role of propagation of

                 ninety years. During the last two decades, the method
                 of maximum likelihood has become the most widely
                 followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to
                 the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we

                 The arbitrage framework is used to develop an economic
                 interpretation for cofactors, determinants, Cramer's
                 rule, and inverse matrices. This is applied to
                 subjective probability theory and classical
                 optimization theory. Arbitrage enforces the laws of
                 probability on the market for contingent claims.
                 Markets are mathematically associated with any
                 classical optimization problem so that the first order
                 necessary conditions are equivalent to the markets
                 being arbitrage-free. The arbitrage-free market prices
                 are the Lagrange multipliers.",

  abstract =     "The inverse scattering problem we are considering in
                 this paper is to determine the shape of a sound-soft,
                 bounded, connected obstacle from a knowledge of the
                 time-harmonic incident wave with frequency in the
                 resonance region and the far field pattern of the
                 scattered wave. After some introductory remarks, we
                 begin by describing the method of integral equations
                 and the null-field method for solving the direct
                 scattering problem. This enables us to define an
                 operator TAU mapping the boundary of the scattering
                 obstacle and the incident field onto the far field
                 pattern. The inverse scattering problem is to invert
                 this operator. In order to do this, we first must
                 examine the range of +95,i. e. to characterize the
                 class of far field patterns, and to establish the
                 existence of TAU ** minus **1 on the range of +95,i. e.
                 to show the uniqueness of the solution to the inverse
                 scattering problem. This analysis shows that for a
                 given measured far field pattern, in general no
                 solution exists to the inverse scattering problem, and
                 if a solution does exist, it does not depend
                 continuously on the measured data, i. e. the problem is
                 improperly posed. We consider a simple model problem
                 that focuses on the nonlinear character of the inverse
                 scattering problem and, motivated by our study of a
                 linearized model, reformulate the inverse scattering
                 problem as a problem in constrained optimization. We
                 conclude by considering the numerical solution of this
                 nonlinear optimization problem.",

                 variables may be viewed as the entries of a symmetric
                 tridiagonal matrix. The spectrum of the matrix is
                 invariant in time and, as t yields infinity, the
                 off-diagonal entries tend to zero, exposing the
                 eigenvalues on the main diagonal. Recently a wave of
                 interest in the Toda and related isospectral flows was
                 sparked in the numerical analysis community by the
                 suggestion that to integrate the Toda flow numerically
                 might be a cost effective way to calculate the
                 eigenvalues of large symmetric tridiagonal matrices. A
                 second source of interest was the recently discovered
                 connection between the Toda flow and the QR algorithm.
                 The present paper has two principal aims. The first is
                 to point out that the Toda and related flows are
                 intimately connected with the power method. This
                 connection clarifies completely the convergence
                 properties of the flows. The relationship of the Toda
                 flow to both the QR algorithm and the power method is
                 based on a connection with the QR matrix factorization.
                 The second aim of this paper is to introduce and
                 discuss families of isospectral flows associated with
                 two other well-known matrix factorizations, the LU
                 factorization and the Cholesky factorization.",

                 linear boundary value problems characteristically have
                 both stable and unstable solution modes. Therefore a
                 stable numerical algorithm should avoid both forward
                 and backward integration of solutions on large
                 intervals. It is shown that most methods (like multiple
                 shooting, collocation, invariant imbedding and
                 difference methods) derive their stability from the
                 fact that they all decouple the continuous or the
                 discrete problem sooner or later (for instance when
                 solving a linear system). This decoupling is related to
                 the dichotomy of the ordinary differential equations.
                 In fact it turns out that the inherent initial value
                 instability is an important prerequisite for a stable
                 utilization of the decoupled representations from which
                 the solutions are computed. How this stability is

                 Planck, Bohr, Sommerfeld, Wilson and Einstein are
                 presented. The virtues and defects of this `old quantum
                 theory' are pointed out. Its replacement by quantum
                 mechanics id is described, leading to the Schroedinger
                 equation for the wave function and the corresponding
                 energy eigenvalues. For separable systems, the
                 reduction of this equation to ordinary differential
                 equations and their asymptotic solution by the WKB
                 method are described, as well as the resulting
                 corrected quantum conditions with integer or
                 half-integer quantum numbers. For nonseparable systems,
                 the analogous asymptotic solution constructed by the
                 author is described, together with the corrected
                 quantum conditions to which it leads. Examples of the
                 use of these conditions in the solution of eigenvalue
                 problems are presented. It is explained that
                 difficulties arise in using this method when the
                 classical motion is stochastic or chaotic. Suggestions
                 for overcoming these difficulties are mentioned.",

                 accuracy. Then several ways to accelerate the slow

                 detail. These are: Richardson extrapolation,
                 overrelaxation, bordering by a singularity condition
                 and appending the usual linear model by a quadratic
                 term. The last two approaches require limited second

                 elliptic partial differential operator L of order 2m.
                 Such iterative methods split A into a difference A
                 equals M minus N. The critical question is the behavior
                 of rho equals max ( vertical lambda vertical, lambda an
                 eigenvalue of M** minus **1N). In this report we
                 develop a theory for the determination of the
                 asymptotic behavior of rho as h approaches 0. This
                 theory depends on recognizing (h**PN) as a weak
                 approximation to a differential operator q of order
                 less than equivalent to m. Then, under `appropriate
                 conditions', rho approximately equals 1 minus LAMBDA
                 //0h**P where LAMBDA //0 is the real part of the
                 minimal eigenvalue of Lu equals lambda qu. The study of
                 the appropriate conditions leads one to three

                 Kreiss and others for studying the suitability of
                 boundary conditions for linear hyperbolic systems of
                 partial differential equations. The existing theory is
                 extremely technical. The present discussion is based on
                 the characteristic variety of the system. The concept
                 of characteristic variety leads to (1) a physical
                 interpretation of the theory in terms of wave
                 propagation, and (2) a physical and geometrical method
                 for visualizing the algebraic structure of the system.
                 The great complexity of the theory is caused by certain
                 aspects of this structure. We also point out
                 connections between the above work and a corresponding
                 theory regarding the stability of finite difference
                 approximations.",

                 methods for solving nonlinear systems of equations that
                 are globally convergent with probability one. These
                 methods are theoretically powerful, and if constructed
                 and implemented properly, are robust, numerically
                 stable, accurate, and practical. The concomitant
                 numerical linear algebra problems deal with rectangular

                 problems associated with the control of agricultural
                 insect pests. The view advocated here is that since
                 agricultural crops are managed biological systems, much
                 of the applied mathematics developed for biological
                 systems may be used in pest control. The problem is
                 broken into three components: (1) strategy selection,
                 (2) tactics selection, and (3) state estimation. The
                 concept of strategy selection is illustrated through a
                 discussion of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) as a
                 means of population suppression. Tactics selection is
                 illustrated by a discussion of the scheduling of
                 pesticide applications. The concept of state estimation
                 is illustrated through two examples. The first example
                 is a discussion of sequential sampling for pests to
                 determine if the pest density has crossed an economic
                 threshold. The second example is a discussion of
                 information provided by trapping for pests when trying
                 to determine the extent of an infestation.",

                 attempted to integrate from the existing literature the
                 progress which has been made so far in this field. Many

                 transmission-line from its response to a given forcing
                 function. This problem is the prototype for a wealth of
                 one-dimensional inverse scattering problems arising in
                 various fields. A unified, straightforward approach is
                 presented, providing all known inversion procedures and
                 some novel ones. The derivations readily follow from
                 causality of signal propagation on the
                 transmission-line. It is shown that a direct
                 exploitation of the signal propagation model leads to
                 recursive, computationally efficient and reliable
                 inversion algorithms. In particular, the relationships
                 between layer-peeling (Schur type, difference equation)
                 and layer-adjoining (Levinson type, integral equation)

                 random matrices. This paper shows that the subadditive
                 inequality that governs the log of the norm of ordinary
                 matrix products also governs other functions of several
                 generalized matrix products. These generalized matrix
                 products are used to calculate minimal cost
                 transportation routes, schedules in manufacturing and
                 minimal and maximal probabilities of multistage
                 processes. The application of subadditive ergodic
                 theory to generalized products of stationary random
                 matrices yields new information about the limiting
                 behavior of generalized products. Exact calculations of
                 the asymptotic behavior are possible in some
                 examples.",

                 concerning the qualitative behavior of solutions of
                 systems of ordinary differential equations which
                 generate an order preserving flow. We restrict our
                 consideration to partial orderings on R\DPRM induced by
                 any one of its orthants; a flow preserves ordering if
                 any two solutions x(t) and y(t) are ordered, $x(t)\leq
                 y(t)$, for all $t<0$ whenever $x(0)\leq y(0)$. A
                 particularly striking result for this class of systems
                 is the easily computable necessary and sufficient
                 condition for stability of an equilibrium. One of our
                 main goals is to show that by allowing partial
                 orderings on R\DPRM generated by orthants other than
                 the positive one, the usual restrictive Kamke
                 (quasimonotone) condition (all `off-diagonal' feedbacks
                 are positive) which results from the standard ordering
                 is modified in such a way as to allow (selectively)
                 some negative feedback. Some recent comparison results
                 for systems of reaction-diffusion equations fit quite
                 naturally in our framework and are reviewed.",

                 Modern developments in regression theory have developed
                 in response to the practical limitations of the
                 least-squares approach. Recent progress has been made

                 tractability. Topics discussed include robust
                 regression, bootstrap measures of variability, local
                 smoothing and cross-validation, projection pursuit,
                 Mallows' $C_p$ criterion, Stein estimation, generalized

                 or partial differential equations are considered. We
                 show how a symmetry may be applied to lower the order
                 of an ordinary differential equation or to obtain
                 similarity solutions of partial differential equations.

                 well-known fact about Hopf bifurcation: if the loss of
                 stability of an equilibrium point results in periodic
                 solutions via Hopf bifurcation, then the stability of
                 these periodic solutions is determined by their
                 stability on an associated center manifold. More
                 precisely, it is shown that the characteristic exponent
                 determining the stability of the periodic solutions is
                 the same whether computed for the original system or
                 the system restricted to the center manifold. Attention

                 one-parameter family of ordinary differential

                 represent very important computational innovations of
                 the early 1950s. These methods came into wide use only
                 in the mid-1970s. Shortly thereafter, vector computers
                 and massive computer memories made it possible to use
                 these methods to solve problems which could not be
                 solved in any other way. Since that time, the
                 algorithms have been further refined and have become a
                 basic tool for solving a wide variety of problems on a
                 wide variety of computer architectures. The conjugate

                 of numerical instability in approximations of
                 dissipative nonlinear partial differential equations.
                 Continuous and discrete problems are studied from the
                 perspective of bifurcation theory, and numerical
                 instability is shown to be associated with the
                 bifurcation of periodic orbits in discrete systems. An
                 asymptotic approach is used to investigate the
                 instability phenomenon further. In particular,
                 equations are derived that describe the interaction of
                 the dynamics of the partial differential equation with
                 the artefacts of the discretization.",

                 based on the study of the parallel beam transform $P$
                 and the divergent beam transform $D$. Both of these map
                 a function $f$ in $R^n$ into a function defined on the
                 set of all lines in $R^n$, by integrating $f$ along
                 these lines. The parallel and divergent $k$-plane

                 integration over $k$-planes (i.e., translates of

                 moving average (DARMA) filters with emphasis on
                 stability. Initially no special assumptions are imposed
                 on the input and output sequences; later the discussion
                 will focus on two cases: bounded sequences (the
                 noncausal case) and sequences with a finite past (the
                 casual case). This paper has two main goals. First, the
                 stability of DARMA filters is made more explicit than
                 by the usual stability theorems found in signal
                 processing literature. Specifically, numerical bounds
                 are provided on how much the filter can increase the
                 \EL\INF-norm of an input sequence. Second, in the
                 noncasual case, valuable pathologies occur when the
                 filter has at least one pole of modulus 1. These
                 pathologies clarify the abstract definitions of a

                 linear acoustics. First, the Kelvin transformation and
                 its application to problems in three-dimensional
                 potential theory is reviewed. Then the application to
                 scattering problems is presented. This involves
                 transforming the exterior problem for the original
                 scatter into a succession of interior problems for the
                 transformed surface. The complete low-frequency
                 expansions of both near and far fields are presented in
                 terms of the solutions of these related interior
                 potential problems. Results are presented for
                 Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions as
                 well as for the transmission problem.",

                 development of fast algorithms Kronecker products have
                 proved quite useful. In this semitutorial paper, we

                 direct sums of matrices, which provide a compact

                 properties from the standard Kronecker product and
                 allows a large class of discrete unitary transforms to
                 be generated from a single recursion formula, is then
                 introduced. The notation is intimately related to
                 sparse matrix factorizations, and examples are included
                 illustrating the utility of the new notation in signal
                 processing applications. Finally, some novel

                 permutations are derived in the framework of Kronecker

                 remarkably efficient, there would appear to be little
                 kinship between fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms
                 and basic multigrid methods. The fast Fourier transform
                 is a powerful direct method for computing the discrete
                 Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence of complex
                 numbers, whereas multigrid methods are highly refined
                 iterative methods that can be used to approximate the
                 solution of systems of equations. However, on closer
                 examination, there are features of both algorithms that
                 suggest at least a conceptual similarity. This note is
                 written in a heuristic spirit and is intended to offer
                 a motivation for the FFT that allows it to be viewed as
                 a multigrid process. The outcome of this exercise is
                 certainly not a more efficient FFT algorithm. But
                 hopefully, it will serve to demonstrate the way in
                 which multilevel thinking can be used to interpret
                 algorithms and it may lead the way to new algorithms.",

                 surface tension forces are important, can be described
                 by third-order ordinary differential equations.
                 Accurate computations are provided here for examples
                 such as $y\PRM\PRM\PRM(x) = -1 + 1/y^2$ that permit the
                 boundary condition $y \rightarrow 1$ as $x \rightarrow
                 -\infty$, so modelling a layer of fluid that is
                 asymptotically uniform behind the draining front. The
                 ultimate fate of the solution as x increases is studied
                 for the above example, and for a generalisation
                 involving a small parameter $\delta$ such that this
                 example is recovered in the limit as $\delta
                 \rightarrow 0$, but which is such that $y \rightarrow
                 \delta$ as $x \rightarrow +\infty$, so modelling
                 draining over an already-wet surface. Matched
                 asymptotic expansions are then used to derive limiting
                 results for small $\delta$, this being a singular
                 perturbation since the problem with $\delta{} = 0$ does
                 not permit $y = 0$. The physical basis for this
                 singularity is the well-known impossibility of moving a
                 contact line over a dry nonslip surface. Other
                 modifications that avoid the singularity by allowing
                 slip are also discussed.",

                 are dynamical systems that simulate memory retrieval.
                 The time evolution of a trajectory of such a system is
                 mathematical recognition, meaning convergence to one of
                 several attractors referred to as mathematical
                 memories. The attractors in this paper are prespecified
                 constant trajectories or limit cycles. Thus
                 mathematical recognition amounts to regarding an input
                 binomial $n$-string with components $\pm 1$ as an
                 initial state of a trajectory, and observing the
                 subsequent convergence of that trajectory to one of the
                 memories. A model with such dynamics is said to have
                 content-addressable memory because partial knowledge of
                 a memory leads to complete retrieval of the memory
                 through system dynamics. Most of this article is
                 devoted to describing the memory model. It is shown
                 that these neural networks can be used to solve a

                 of correcting binary code.",

                 working set to define the search direction and
                 multiplier estimates. In the method proposed by
                 Fletcher in 1971, and in several subsequent
                 mathematically equivalent methods, the working set is
                 chosen to control the inertia of the reduced Hessian,
                 which is never permitted to have more than one
                 nonpositive eigenvalue. (Such methods will be called
                 inertia-controlling.) This paper presents an overview
                 of a generic inertia-controlling QP method, including
                 the equations satisfied by the search direction when
                 the reduced Hessian is positive definite, singular and
                 indefinite. Recurrence relations are derived that
                 define the search direction and Lagrange multiplier
                 vector through equations related to the
                 Karush--Kuhn--Tucker system. Discussion is included of
                 connections with inertia-controlling methods that

                 instances of the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem
                 (STSP) to optimality. The core of the algorithm is a
                 `polyhedral' cutting-plane procedure that exploits a
                 subset of the system of linear inequalities defining
                 the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the
                 Hamiltonian cycles of a complete graph. The cuts are
                 generated by several identification procedures that
                 have been described in a companion paper. Whenever the
                 cutting-plane procedure does not terminate with an
                 optimal solution the algorithm uses a tree-search
                 strategy that, as opposed to branch-and-bound, keeps on
                 producing cuts after branching. The algorithm has been
                 implemented in FORTRAN. Two different linear
                 programming (LP) packages have been used as the LP
                 solver. The implementation of the algorithm and the
                 interface with one of the LP solvers is described in
                 sufficient detail to permit the replication of our
                 experiments. Computational results are reported with up
                 to 42 STSPs with sizes ranging from 48 to 2,392 nodes.
                 Most of the medium-sized test problems are taken from
                 the literature; all others are large-scale real-world
                 problems. All of the instances considered in this study
                 were solved to optimality by the algorithm in
                 `reasonable' computation times.",

  abstract =     "The literature on network flow problems is extensive,
                 and over the past 40 years researchers have made
                 continuous improvements to algorithms for solving
                 several classes of problems. However, the surge of
                 activity concerning the algorithmic aspects of network
                 flow problems over the past few years has been
                 particularly striking. Several techniques have proven
                 to be very successful in permitting researchers to make
                 these recent contributions: (i) scaling of the problem
                 data; (ii) improved analysis of algorithms, especially
                 amortized worst-case performance and the use of
                 potential functions; and (iii) enhanced data
                 structures. This survey illustrates some of these
                 techniques and their usefulness in developing faster
                 network flow algorithms. The discussion focuses on the
                 design of faster algorithms from the worst-case
                 perspective, and is limited to the following
                 fundamental problems: the shortest path problem, the
                 maximum flow problem, and the minimum cost flow
                 problem. Several representative algorithms from each
                 problem class are considered, including the radix heap
                 algorithm for the shortest path problem, preflow push
                 algorithms for the maximum flow problem, and the
                 pseudoflow push algorithms for the minimum cost flow
                 problem.",

                 programming. When viewed in Dantzig's column space

                 generalization of the simplex method. This derivation

                 stable properties associated with systems described by

                 approximating systems which retain information
                 pertinent to these properties. For example, let
                 $X_0,\ldots{}, X_m$ be real analytic vector fields on
                 an $n$-manifold $M$. An affine control system has the
                 form (i) $x = X_0(x) + \Sigma_1^m u_iX_i(x)$; a
                 second-order partial differential equation can be
                 written as (ii) $\Sigma_{i=1}^m X_i^2v - X_0v = f$,
                 while if $X_0(p) = 0$ the asymptotic stability of the
                 rest solution requires analysis of (iii) $x = X_0(x)$.
                 If, in (ii), $m < n$ yet the vector fields in the Lie
                 algebra generated by $X_1,\ldots{},X_m$, when evaluated

                 operator is hypoelliptic but an approximation of the
                 vector fields needed to describe the singularity in a
                 parametrix must retain more information than a
                 linearization of the vector fields does. Similarly, the
                 question of small time local controllability of (i) has
                 been dealt with by constructing higher-order
                 approximating vector fields which generate a nilpotent
                 Lie algebra. The theory of these high-order

                 transform,' which admits computation by an algorithm
                 that has complexity proportional to the fast Fourier
                 transform algorithm. Whereas the discrete Fourier
                 transform (DFT) is based on integral roots of unity
                 $e\+-2\pi/n$, the fractional Fourier transform is based
                 on fractional roots of unity $e\+-2\pi@i\alpha$ where
                 $\alpha$ is arbitrary. The fractional Fourier transform
                 and the corresponding fast algorithm are useful for
                 such applications as computing DFTs of sequences with
                 prime lengths, computing DFTs of sparse sequences,
                 analyzing sequences with noninteger periodicities,
                 performing high-resolution trigonometric interpolation,
                 detecting lines in noisy images, and detecting signals
                 with linearly drifting frequencies. In many cases, the
                 resulting algorithms are faster by arbitrarily large

                 are either nonlinear or stochastic or both. The
                 nonlinear structures emphasized here are the nonlinear
                 hyperbolic waves, which occur in the solutions of
                 nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws and associated
                 dissipative equations. These equations are those most
                 commonly used to model physical and chemical processes
                 in continuum systems. Stochastic solutions of partial
                 differential equations may result from stochastic data.
                 Stochastic solutions can also result from internal
                 considerations, i.e., from instabilities inherent in
                 the equation itself, if the equation is nonlinear. The
                 instabilities which give rise to chaotic solutions are
                 generally unstable on a very large range of length
                 scales, or in some approximation, on all length scales.
                 Fractal geometries provide one model for the typically
                 intermittent, or blotchy, chaos which can occur, and
                 the renormalization group is an analytic tool which in
                 some cases has given a quantitatively correct theory of
                 chaotic solutions of partial differential equations.",

                 superconductivity. First some well-known features of
                 superconducting materials are reviewed and then various
                 results concerning the model, the resultant
                 differential equations, and their solution on bounded
                 domains are derived. Then, finite element
                 approximations of the solutions of the Ginzburg--Landau
                 equations are considered and error estimates of optimal
                 order are derived.",

                 method for the solution of large sparse symmetric
                 positive definite linear systems. The method is
                 formulated in terms of frontal matrices, update
                 matrices, and an assembly tree. Formal definitions of
                 these notions are given based on the sparse matrix
                 structure. Various advances to the basic method are
                 surveyed. They include the role of matrix reorderings,
                 the use of supernodes, and other implementation
                 techniques. The use of the method in different

                 a number of results scattered in the literature and
                 provides also an introduction to the topic. Convergence
                 proofs for the classical Euler method and for a class
                 of multistep methods are outlined. It is shown how
                 numerical methods for stiff differential equations can
                 be adapted to differential inclusions with additional
                 monotonicity properties. Together with suitable
                 localization procedures, this approach results in
                 higher-order methods. Convergence properties of
                 difference methods with selection strategies are
                 investigated, especially strategies forcing convergence

                 period of HIV-1, without significantly reducing
                 infectiousness, will necessarily increase prevalence of
                 infection, unless accompanied by appropriate levels of
                 behavior change. However, the number of AIDS-related
                 deaths may decline despite a large increase in numbers
                 of seropositives, if the latter is balanced by an
                 increase in the average life-span of an infected
                 individual. In a homogeneous population, treatment will
                 be of benefit to both the individual and the community
                 if the basic reproductive rate of the disease is high,
                 provided that the coverage and efficacy are also high.
                 However, therapy may be of detriment to the community
                 (i.e., produce an increase in the number of AIDS
                 deaths) under a combination of low drug efficacy and
                 high coverage or vice versa, if the basic reproductive
                 rate is low. In a behaviorally heterogeneous population
                 with proportionate mixing, the outcome of treatment is
                 extremely sensitive to the rate of cessation of sexual
                 activity. Within certain parameter combinations, the
                 sensitivity of the system to the rate of cessation of
                 sexual activity can cause a larger decrease in
                 population size at higher basic reproductive rates.
                 This is in direct contrast to the homogeneous case,
                 where the outcome of therapy is less likely to be
                 perverse at higher values of the basic reproductive
                 rate. The conclusions of this paper are not in conflict
                 with the moral imperative of providing treatment for
                 individuals infected with HIV.",

  abstract =     "Manufacturers of consumer products, such as
                 automobiles, usually offer warranties guaranteeing the
                 product or its parts, for example, for five years or
                 50,000 miles, whichever comes first. There are at least
                 two issues of interest to applied mathematicians and
                 statisticians that arise from warranty considerations.
                 The first is the specification of an optimum
                 price-warranty combination, and the second is the
                 forecast of a reserve fund to meet warranty claims
                 against the product. The former involves a
                 consideration of the item's reliability, its rate of
                 usage, the consumer's attitude toward a specific
                 warranty, and the competitor's actions, all of which
                 lead towards a game theoretic formulation of the
                 problem. The latter involves the analysis of a special
                 kind of time series in two-dimensions, for which the
                 use of dynamic linear models appears to be natural.
                 This is an expository paper. Due to the timeliness of
                 the topic, the focus here is on problem definition, its
                 scope, and its formulation in a manner that facilitates
                 analysis. Imbedded in the discussion are strategies for
                 addressing some of the ensuing issues. The overall goal
                 is to enlighten the reader about an area of research in
                 the mathematical sciences that has an impact on
                 industrial competitiveness and the manufacturing

                 conditions give rise to systems of ordinary
                 differential equations, many nonlinear, that are called
                 compartmental systems. In this paper, the authors
                 define compartmental systems, specify their relations
                 to other nonnegative systems, and discuss examples of
                 applications. The authors review the qualitative
                 results on linear and nonlinear compartmental systems,
                 including their relation to cooperative systems. They
                 review the results for linear compartmental systems and
                 then integrate and expand the results on nonlinear
                 compartmental systems, providing a framework for
                 unifying them under a few general theorems. In the
                 course of doing this they complete the solution of a
                 problem posed by Bellman and show that closed
                 nonlinear, autonomous, $n$-compartment systems can show
                 the full gamut of possible behaviors of systems of
                 ordinary differential equations. Finally, to provide
                 additional structure to this study, the authors show
                 how to partition compartmental systems of arbitrary
                 connectivities into four basic types and then give the
                 qualitative analysis for autonomous, nonlinear

  abstract =     "For the class of periodic functions $u(x)$ that can be
                 associated with closed orbits in the $(u, u\PRM)$
                 phase-plane described by a differential equation of the
                 form $u\PRM^2 = p-F(u)$, around some local minimum of
                 $F(u)$, a useful integral expression is obtained for
                 any derivative with respect to the parameter $p$ of any
                 suitably differentiable function of $u$ and $p$
                 integrated over one period in $x$. That is, an
                 expression is found for $(d/dp)^k \int_0\+\lambda(p)\/
                 f(u, p)\,dx$, where $\lambda(p)$ is the period. Some
                 illustrative examples are presented concerning
                 relationships between moments of $u(x)$ and some forms
                 of the function $F(u)$.",

                 variables introduced in a problem of constrained
                 minimization in order to write first-order optimality
                 conditions formally as a system of equations. Modern
                 applications, with their emphasis on numerical methods
                 and more complicated side conditions than equations,
                 have demanded deeper understanding of the concept and
                 how it fits into a larger theoretical picture. A major
                 line of research has been the nonsmooth geometry of
                 one-sided tangent and normal vectors to the set of
                 points satisfying the given constraints. Another has
                 been the game-theoretic role of multiplier vectors as
                 solutions to a dual problem. Interpretations as
                 generalized derivatives of the optimal value with
                 respect to problem parameters have also been explored.
                 Lagrange multipliers are now being seen as arising from
                 a general rule for the subdifferentiation of a
                 nonsmooth objective function which allows
                 black-and-white constraints to be replaced by penalty
                 expressions. This paper traces such themes in the
                 current theory of Lagrange multipliers, providing along
                 the way a free-standing exposition of basic nonsmooth

  abstract =     "This paper has two goals: the first is to introduce
                 applied mathematicians to a new technique involving
                 several complex variable residue theory. This is a
                 multidimensional extension of a well-known result for
                 functions of one complex variable [P. Griffiths and J.
                 Harris, Principles of Algebraic Geometry, John Wiley
                 and Sons, New York, 1978] that yields useful asymptotic
                 information when applied to generating functions. The
                 authors begin by reviewing the residue theory of one
                 complex variable, noting that there are useful sets of
                 relationships between the residues of certain rational
                 functions. They use the one-dimensional theory to
                 rederive and extend a well-known result of Koenigsberg
                 [P. G. Harrison, Oper. Res., 33 (1985), pp. 464-468].
                 These relationships, to a degree, can be found for
                 residues of the analogous rational functions of several
                 complex variables. The second goal is to apply these
                 tools to the study of product from queueing networks.
                 It is well known that for generating functions of a
                 single variable, residue theory turns out to be a very
                 powerful tool for studying the asymptotic behavior of
                 the coefficients. In this paper, the authors
                 investigate how these ideas extend to the study of
                 multidimensional generating functions. Then they
                 demonstrate these techniques on generating functions
                 which arise from the theory of product from queueing
                 networks. In particular, they compute explicitly the
                 generating function of the partition function for a
                 variety of networks. Then, using these generating
                 functions, they demonstrate the utility and limitations
                 of these techniques.",

  abstract =     "The authors present an expository review of the theory
                 of regenerative processes starting with the more
                 traditional notions and then moving on to some of the
                 more recent and modern developments. First, classical
                 regenerative processes are defined and some of their
                 properties are reviewed. This includes discussion of
                 time averages, weak and total variation convergence,
                 and stationary versions of processes. Through examples,
                 limitations of the classical definition are
                 illustrated, and a more general definition is
                 introduced, where cycle lengths are independently and
                 identically distributed, but the cycles themselves are
                 permitted to be dependent. Then the connection between
                 this definition and Harris-recurrent Markov chains is
                 shown, and both discrete and continuous-time processes,
                 which turn out to have one-dependent cycles are
                 discussed. In general, these continuous-time processes
                 also have one-dependent cycle lengths, and hence are
                 not regenerative, even by the more general definition.
                 Some one-dependent continuous-time processes turn out
                 to have independently and identically distributed cycle
                 lengths, when looked at appropriately. The authors
                 briefly discuss some recent work on this as well as
                 briefly illustrate the connection between regenerative
                 processes and the method of renovation found in the
                 Russian literature. Finally, the most general notion of
                 regenerative, synchronous processes are discussed and a
                 general tightness result is given.",

  abstract =     "A number of mathematical theories to describe the
                 momentum and energy balances associated with running
                 have been advocated since the pioneering work of the
                 British biologist A. V. Hill in the 1920s. Since the
                 various models lead to quite different conclusions and
                 predictions about the balances with running, it is
                 instructive to examine critically the assumptions
                 underlying them. So, for example, depending on the
                 model employed, it has been predicted that, for a
                 sprinter, the relative expenditure of energy in
                 overcoming air resistance lies somewhere in the range
                 of 2 to 16\%. This wide range of values derives from
                 the various estimates of the propulsive force exerted
                 during sprinting, indicating just how disparate the
                 predictions among the models are. In the early 1970s
                 Keller built on the ideas of Hill to develop a complete
                 theoretical model for competitive running in which the
                 goal of the athlete is to cover the race distance in a
                 minimum amount of time (subject to certain constraints
                 on the runner.) While the Hill-Keller model provides
                 only a first approximation, in that no attempt is made
                 to model separately the anaerobic and the aerobic
                 pathways for energy conversion and only the simplest
                 model for the resistance to motion is considered, it
                 nevertheless gives a good overall representation of the
                 world running records from 60 yds. to 10 km. Based on a
                 careful appraisal of the various models, it is
                 suggested here that approximately 3\% of a sprinter's
                 effort is spent on overcoming air resistance, a figure
                 that is supported by an independent estimate derived
                 from the long jump. An interesting consequences of the
                 analysis is the feature that the benefits of sprinting
                 at altitude cannot be accounted for wholly by the
                 reduced air density, suggesting that there may be some
                 physiological benefit to sprinting at altitude. As a
                 special application of the estimate for the cost of
                 overcoming air resistance, an appraisal has been made
                 of the series of 100 m races run at the U. S. Olympic
                 Trials in 1988 in which Florence Griffin-Joyner set a
                 new world record. This record has been treated with
                 great suspicion in the athletics community because of a
                 questionable wind-gauge reading. It is shown here that
                 the record was almost certainly wind aided, with a
                 trailing wind of 4 ms\+-1\/ or more.",

                 applications in Section 2, including control of robots,
                 eigenvalue computations, mechanical stress of
                 materials, and statistical design, the authors describe
                 a class of optimization problems which are referred to
                 as semi-infinite, because their constraints bound
                 functions of a finite number of variables on a whole
                 region. In Sections 3-5, first-and second-order
                 optimality conditions are derived for general
                 non-linear problems as well as a procedure for reducing
                 the problem locally to one with only finitely many
                 constraints. Another main effort for achieving
                 simplification is through duality in Section 6. There,
                 algebraic properties of finite linear programming are
                 brought to bear on theory in semi-infinite programming.
                 Section 7 treats numerical methods based on either
                 discretization or local reduction with the emphasis on
                 the design of superlinearly convergent (SQP-type)
                 methods. Taking this differentiable point of view, this
                 paper can be considered to be complementary to the
                 review of given by Polak [SIAM Rev., 29 (1987), pp.
                 21-89] on the nondifferentiable approach. The last,

                 a number of algorithms for solving eigenvalue problems,
                 including the power method, subspace iteration, the QR
                 algorithm, and the Arnoldi and symmetric Lanczos
                 algorithms. The symmetric Lanczos algorithm is shown to
                 be identical to the three-term recursion (Stieltjes
                 procedure) for computing orthogonal polynomials with
                 respect to a measure on the real line. The connection
                 between measures on the line and symmetric tridiagonal
                 (Jacobi) matrices is investigated. If such a matrix is
                 transformed by a step of the QR algorithm, there is a
                 corresponding transformation in the measure. The
                 tridiagonal matrices are also exploited for the
                 construction of Gaussian quadrature formulas for
                 measures on the line. The developments on the real line
                 are replicated with suitable modifications on the unit
                 circle via Lanczos-like procedures for unitary
                 operators. The best-known procedure of this type is the
                 recursion of Szego for computing orthogonal polynomials
                 on the unit circle. The approach taken in this paper is
                 to develop recursions that compute orthogonal Laurent
                 polynomials (rational functions) rather than
                 polynomials. These recursions are then modified to
                 yield the Szego recursion.",

                 numbers of dislocations is described. First, discrete
                 dislocations are discussed from the mathematical and
                 crystallographical points of view, and their stress
                 fields are calculated. These building blocks are
                 averaged to construct a homogenised model in which the
                 dislocation distribution is averaged to a number
                 density tensor. Equilibrium configurations are then
                 considered and it is proved that, in the absence of
                 externally applied stresses, the only possible finite,
                 simply connected distributions are ones in which all
                 components of stress vanish everywhere. Some examples
                 are given of these zero-stress everywhere (ZSE)
                 distributions, and their geometrical interpretation is
                 considered in terms of the plastic distortion tensor,
                 which shows that they are equivalent to local rotations
                 of the crystal lattice. Finally, some conjectures are
                 made about the response of a cellular ZSE distribution
                 to an applied stress, introducing the idea of
                 `polarization' by analogy with electromagnetism, and a
                 possible scenario is sketched for the large-scale
                 deformations associated with plastic flow.",

  abstract =     "Much of the recent work dealing with quasi-random
                 methods has been aimed at establishing the best
                 possible asymptotic rates of convergence to zero of the
                 error resulting when a finite-dimensional integral is
                 replaced by a finite sum of integrand values. In
                 contrast with this perspective to concentrate on
                 asymptotic convergence rates, this paper emphasizes
                 quasi-random methods that are effective for all sample
                 sizes. Throughout the paper, the problem of estimating
                 finite-dimensional integrals is used to illustrate the
                 major ideas, although much of what is done applies
                 equally to the problem of solving certain Fredholm
                 integral equations. Some new techniques, based on
                 error-reducing transformations of the integrand, are
                 described that have been shown to be useful both in
                 estimating high-dimensional integrals and in solving
                 integral equations. These techniques illustrate the
                 utility of carrying over to the quasi-Monte Carlo
                 method certain devices that have proven to be very
                 valuable in statistical (pseudorandom) Monte Carlo
                 applications.",

                 where the only inequality constraints are nonnegativity
                 constraints on the variables. In these problems, the
                 ability to identify zero variables (binding
                 constraints) early on in an iterative method is of
                 considerable value and can be used to computational
                 advantage. This work first gives a formal presentation
                 of the notion of indicators for identifying zero
                 variables, and then studies various indicators proposed
                 in the literature for use with interior-point methods
                 for linear programming. Both theory and experimentation
                 are presented that speak strongly against the use of
                 the variables as indicators; perhaps the most
                 frequently used indicator in the literature. This study
                 implies that an indicator proposed by Tapia is
                 particularly effective in context of primal-dual
                 interior-point method. The local rate of convergence
                 for several indicators is also studied.",

  abstract =     "The notion of NP-completeness has helped researchers
                 in several fields to argue that some problems are
                 intrinsically difficult to solve computationally, even
                 though proof of that is beyond the current state of our
                 knowledge. The study of properties of complete sets and
                 reducibilities has led to the development of a branch
                 of complexity theory called structural complexity
                 theory. This paper is a brief survey of recent results
                 in structural complexity theory and is aimed at
                 researchers who know something about computational
                 complexity theory but do not work in structural
                 complexity theory. To describe the theory in a way that
                 gives the reader some concrete applications the results
                 are described in terms of their relationship to $P=?NP$

                 value problems in ordinary differential equations has
                 propagation mechanisms in stiff problems a question
                 modeled effectively by contractive linear or nonlinear
                 problems. While this has resulted in a coherent and
                 self-contained body of knowledge, it has never been
                 entirely clear to what extent this theory is relevant
                 for problems exhibiting more complicating dynamics.
                 This on-going work is unified and in particular,
                 striking similarities between this new developing
                 stability theory and the classical linear and nonlinear
                 stability theories are emphasized. The classical
                 theories of A, B and algebraic stability for
                 Runge--Kutta methods are briefly reviewed: the dynamics
                 of solutions within the classes of equations to which
                 these theories apply-linear decay and contractive
                 problems --- are studied. Four other categories of
                 equations-gradient, dissipative, conservative and
                 Hamiltonian systems --- are considered. Relationships
                 and differences between the possible dynamics in each
                 category, which range from multiple competing
                 equilibria to chaotic solutions, are highlighted.
                 Runge--Kutta schemes that preserves the dynamical
                 structures of the underlying problem are sought and
                 indications of a strong relationship between the
                 developing stability theory for these new categories
                 and the classical existing stability theory for the
                 older problems are given. Algebraic stability in
                 particular, is seen to play a central role. It should
                 be emphasized that in all cases the class of methods
                 for which a coherent and complete numerical stability
                 theory exists given a structural assumption on the
                 initial value problem, is often considerably smaller
                 than the class of method found to be effective in
                 practice. Nonetheless it is arguable that it is
                 valuable to develop such stability theories to provide
                 a firm theoretical framework in which to interpret
                 existing methods and to formulate goals in the
                 construction of new methods. Furthermore, there are
                 indications that the theory of algebraic stability may
                 sometimes be useful in the analysis of error control
                 codes which are not stable in a fixed step
                 implementation this work is described.",

                 multidimensional wavelets and wavelet packets are
                 discussed. Several examples of wavelet families are
                 introduced and compared. Finally, the essentials of two

                 equations. I. S. Gradstein followed and he considered
                 linear equations and systems. He had pupils who worked
                 with him while Tikhonov do not. B. Vasilieva
                 investigated the derivatives of the solutions of
                 Tikhonov's equations, while Vosolov derived the
                 averaging method. Only a small development was done by
                 the others who treated the problem. The most
                 significant work was done by A. J. Ralinin. Belyanin
                 tackled semiconductor devices by describing them in
                 equations. He considered one-dimensional and
                 two-dimensional models of diodes.",

                 Laplacian is important in the understanding of
                 distributed parameter vibration systems and quantum
                 mechanics. The elliptical domain is advantageous for
                 such work because it allows the explicit representation
                 of eigenfunctions as products of the Mathieu functions.
                 In [Ann. Phys., 9 (1960), pp. 24-75], Keller and
                 Rubinow used wave propagation, geometrical optics, and
                 WKB methods to show that two special types of
                 eigenmodes, whispering gallery and bouncing ball modes,
                 exist on a general convex domain, and they illustrated
                 the case of an elliptical domain. In this paper, we
                 develop a numerical package of the Mathieu and modified
                 Mathieu functions to actually construct profiles of a
                 sequence of eigenfunctions in order to visualize such
                 special eigenmodes and others. In the process, we have
                 also been able to observe a new type of transition
                 state named `focusing modes' herein, which seem to have
                 a complementary behavior to the bouncing ball modes.
                 Numerical eigenvalues are tabulated for comparison and
                 some discussions on the `focusing modes' are
                 presented.",

                 deconvolution for functions in one dimension. It will
                 be shown how the theory can work with the Shannon
                 Sampling Theorem. Since the purpose of deconvolution is
                 greater signal resolution, it will also be shown how
                 data compression and analysis are implemented in
                 coordination with the deconvolution methods described
                 above. Finally, several applications of the theory are

                 version and $h$-$p$ version. In the $p$ version, a
                 fixed mesh is used and $p$ is allowed to increase. The
                 $h$-$p$ version combines both approaches. The authors
                 describe and explain the basic properties and
                 characteristics of these newer versions, especially in
                 areas where their behavior is significantly different
                 from that of the $h$ version. Simplified proofs of key
                 concepts are included and computational illustrations
                 of several results are provided. A benchmark comparison
                 between the various versions in included.",

                 The methodology is particularly useful for the analysis
                 of the geometrical structure in an image. The main goal

                 underlying philosophy and the mathematical theories
                 which are relevant to this field. The following topics
                 are discussed: introduction to mathematical morphology;
                 generalization to complete lattices; morphological
                 filters and their construction by iteration;
                 geometrical aspects of morphology (e.g., convexity,
                 distance, geodesic operators, granulometries, metric
                 dilations, distance transform, cost functions); and

  abstract =     "Anti-plane shear deformations are one of the simplest
                 classes of deformations that solids can undergo. In
                 anti-plane shear of a cylindrical body, the
                 displacement is parallel to the generators of the
                 cylinder and is independent of the axial coordinate.
                 Thus anti-plane shear, with just a single scalar axial
                 displacement field, may be viewed as complementary to
                 the more complicated plane strain deformation. Because
                 of its relative analytic simplicity compared with plane
                 problems, the anti-plane shear problem plays a useful
                 role as a pilot problem, within which various aspects
                 of solutions in solid mechanics may be examined in a
                 particularly simple setting. In this review article,
                 modern developments concerning the anti-plane shear
                 model and its applications are described for both
                 linear and nonlinear solid mechanics.",

  abstract =     "This paper discusses the design of linear algebra
                 libraries for high performance computers. Particular
                 emphasis is placed on the development of scalable
                 algorithms for multiple instruction multiple data
                 (MIMD) distributed memory concurrent computers. A brief
                 description of the EISPACK, LINPACK, and LAPACK
                 libraries is given, followed by an outline of
                 ScaLAPACK, which is a distributed memory version of
                 LAPACK currently under development. The importance of
                 block-partitioned algorithms in reducing the frequency
                 of data movement between different levels of
                 hierarchical memory is stressed. The use of such
                 algorithms helps reduce the message startup costs on
                 distributed memory concurrent computers. Other key
                 ideas in our approach are the use of distributed
                 versions of the Level 2 and Level 3 basic linear
                 algebra subprograms (BLAS) as computational building
                 blocks, and the use of basic linear algebra
                 communication subprograms (BLACS) as communication
                 building blocks. Together the distributed BLAS and the
                 BLACS can be used to construct higher-level algorithms,
                 and hide many details of the parallelism from the
                 application developer. The block-cyclic data
                 distribution is described and adopted as a good way of
                 distributing block-partitioned matrices.
                 Block-partitioned versions of the Cholesky and LU
                 factorizations are presented, and optimization issues
                 associated with the implementation of the LU
                 factorization algorithm on distributed memory
                 concurrent computers are discussed, together with its
                 performance on the Intel Delta system. Finally,
                 approaches to the design of library interfaces are
                 reviewed.",

  abstract =     "The shoulder of a packaging machine is a developable
                 surface that guides the packing material without
                 stretching or tearing. The shoulder is traditionally
                 manufactured by bending a flexible plate along a given
                 bending curve, also without stretching or tearing. In
                 this paper, the shoulder geometry is described
                 mathematically by methods from classical differential
                 geometry. For a given bending curve the generating
                 lines of the (developable) shoulder surface are
                 completely specified. It is shown that the bending
                 curve can be chosen such that the resulting shoulder
                 contains a planar triangle. The special case of a
                 conical shoulder is also discussed, and the underlying
                 bending curve is determined explicitly.",

                 development of linear elasticity, not only in
                 connection with the basic theoretical issues such as
                 existence and uniqueness, but also in a variety of
                 applications. The Korn inequalities, and other related
                 inequalities for integrals of quadratic functionals,
                 also arise in the analysis of viscous incompressible
                 fluid flow. The dimensionless optimal constants
                 appearing in these inequalities, the Korn constants,
                 depend only on the shape of the domains of concern.
                 Information on the geometric dependence of these
                 constants is essential in applications. In this review
                 article, we summarize the major results on Korn's
                 inequalities for bounded domains in two and three
                 dimensions, with emphasis on results concerning the
                 Korn constants. Some applications in continuum

  abstract =     "Let $A \in R\+m\times n$ denote an arbitrary matrix.
                 If $x \in R^n$ and $y \in R^m$ are vectors such that
                 $\omega = y^T Ax \DNEQ 0$, then the matrix $B:= A -
                 \omega\+-1\/ Axy^T A$ has rank exactly one less than
                 the rank of $A$. This Wedderburn rank-one reduction
                 formula is easy to prove, yet the idea is so powerful
                 that perhaps all matrix factorizations can be derived
                 from it. The formula also appears in places such as the
                 positive definite secant updates BFGS and DFP as well
                 as the ABS methods. By repeatedly applying the formula
                 to reduce ranks, a biconjugation process analogous to
                 the Gram--Schmidt process with oblique projections can
                 be developed. This process provides a mechanism for
                 constructing factorizations such as $LDM^T$, $QR$, and
                 SVD under a common framework of a general biconjugate
                 decomposition $V^T AU = \Omega$ that is diagonal and
                 nonsingular. Two characterizations of biconjugation
                 provide new insight into the Lanczos method and its
                 breakdown. One characterization shows that the Lanczos
                 algorithm (and the conjugate gradient method) is a
                 special case of the rank-one process; in fact, these
                 processes can be identified with the class of
                 biconjugate direction methods so that history is pushed
                 back by about twenty years.",

  abstract =     "This review surveys a significant set of recent ideas
                 developed in the study of nonlinear Galerkin
                 approximation. A significant role is played by the
                 Krasnosel'skii calculus, which represents a
                 generalization of the classical inf-sup linear
                 saddlepoint theory. A description of a proper extension
                 of this calculus and the relation to the inf-sup theory
                 are part of this review. The general study is motivated
                 by steady-state, self-consistent, drift-diffusion
                 systems. The mixed boundary value problem for nonlinear
                 elliptic systems is studied with respect to defining a
                 sequence of convergent approximations, satisfying
                 requirements of: (i) optimal convergence rate; (ii)
                 computability; and, (iii) stability. It is shown how
                 the fixed point and numerical fixed point maps of the
                 system, in conjunction with the Newton--Kantorovich
                 method applied to the numerical fixed point map, permit
                 a solution of this approximation problem. A critical
                 aspect of the study is the identification of the
                 breakdown of the Newton--Kantorovich method, when
                 applied to the differential system in an approximate
                 way. This is now known as the numerical loss of
                 derivatives. As an antidote, a linearized variant of
                 successive approximation, with locally defined
                 subproblems bounded in number at each iteration, is
                 demonstrated. In (ii), a distinction is made between
                 the outer analytical iteration, and the inner
                 iteration, governed by numerical linear algebra. The
                 systems studied are broad enough to include important
                 application areas in engineering and science, for which
                 significant computational experience is available.",

  abstract =     "Currently, most approaches to retrieving textual
                 materials from scientific databases depend on a lexical
                 match between words in users' requests and those in or
                 assigned to documents in a database. Because of the
                 tremendous diversity in the words people use to
                 describe the same document, lexical methods are
                 necessarily incomplete and imprecise. Using the
                 singular value decomposition (SVD), one can take
                 advantage of the implicit higher-order structure in the
                 association of terms with documents by determining the
                 SVD of large sparse term by document matrices. Terms
                 and documents represented by 200-300 of the largest
                 singular vectors are then matched against user queries.
                 We call this retrieval method latent semantic indexing
                 (LSI) because the subspace represents important
                 associative relationships between terms and documents
                 that are not evident in individual documents. LSI is a
                 completely automatic yet intelligent indexing method,
                 widely applicable, and a promising way to improve
                 users' access to many kinds of textual materials, or to
                 documents and services for which textual descriptions
                 are available. A survey of the computational
                 requirements for managing LSI-encoded databases as well
                 as current and future applications of LSI is
                 presented.",

                 of papers on this subject in the recent literature.
                 This paper collects 30 methods for bit reversing an
                 array. Each method was recoded into a uniform style in
                 Fortran and its performance measured on several
                 different machines, each with a different memory
                 system. This paper includes a description of how the
                 memories of the machines operate to motivate two new
                 algorithms that perform substantially better than the

                 variety of ways for about a century, they seem

                 plan is to give motivation for the topic, elementary
                 properties of eigencurves, illustrations on a simple
                 example first studied by Richardson in 1918 (and since
                 then by several authors), and some natural questions

                 function subject to the constraint that an affine
                 combination of symmetric matrices is positive
                 semidefinite. Such a constraint is nonlinear and
                 nonsmooth, but convex, so semidefinite programs are
                 convex optimization problems. Semidefinite programming
                 unifies several standard problems (e.g., linear and
                 quadratic programming) and finds many applications in
                 engineering and combinatorial optimization. Although
                 semidefinite programs are much more general than linear
                 programs, they are not much harder to solve. Most
                 interior-point methods for linear programming have been
                 generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear
                 programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case
                 complexity and perform very well in practice. This

                 semidefinite programs and an introduction to

                 and let abc be the fraction of the electorate with

                 introduces the pictogram for the vote vector V = (abc

                 three pairwise intersecting chords. It is proven that

                 six domains along the circumference, listed
                 counterclockwise, are proportional to the components of
                 V. The Condorcet paradox is discussed by means of
                 pictograms and other simple geometric ideas. Real
                 political opinion poll data are visualized with
                 pictograms, and it is shown how political movements can
                 be monitored this way.",

                 small orders ($n < 4$), new approximate formulas for

                 appropriate spatial and temporal scales for the
                 predator are different from those for they prey. The

                 experiences the environment as a collection of patches
                 and disperses among the patches by immigration and
                 emigration on a time scale much shorter than its

                 patch as a continuum on which it disperses by diffusion
                 while reproducing logistically. The models are studied

                 in general Hilbert spaces and on the quality of
                 convergence are brought out. Numerous examples are

                 methods for solving Toeplitz systems. One of the main
                 results is that the complexity of solving a large class
                 of $n$-by-$n$ Toeplitz systems is reduced to $O(n \log

                 operations required by fast direct Toeplitz solvers.
                 Different preconditioners proposed for Toeplitz systems
                 are reviewed. Applications to Toeplitz-related systems

                 access to a centralised system with a partial database
                 as an interim path toward client-server systems.
                 Calculations have provided a three-dimensional (3d)

                 transaction, distributed\slash centralised ratio and
                 speed of server, cycles per transaction, and degree of
                 multiprogramming. The 3d surface has a cusp property
                 which, if not appreciated visually, can lead to
                 undesirable planning pathways of system sizing due to
                 discontinuous effects in the catastrophe theory of such

                 a 3d visual application of the situation can also
                 logically lead to the stage for the decision between a

  abstract =     "We describe recent theoretical and experimental
                 progress on making objects invisible to detection by
                 electromagnetic waves. Ideas for devices that would
                 once have seemed fanciful may now be at least
                 approximately implemented physically using a new class
                 of artificially structured materials called
                 metamaterials. Maxwell's equations have transformation
                 laws that allow for the design of electromagnetic
                 material parameters that steer light around a hidden
                 region, returning it to its original path on the far
                 side. Not only would observers be unaware of the
                 contents of the hidden region, they would not even be
                 aware that something was being hidden. An object
                 contained in the hidden region, which would have no
                 shadow, is said to be cloaked. Proposals for, and even
                 experimental implementations of, such cloaking devices
                 have received the most attention, but other designs
                 having striking effects on wave propagation are
                 possible. All of these designs are initially based on
                 the transformation laws of the equations that govern
                 wave propagation but, due to the singular parameters
                 that give rise to the desired effects, care needs to be
                 taken in formulating and analyzing physically
                 meaningful solutions. We recount the recent history of
                 the subject and discuss some of the mathematical and
                 physical issues involved.",

  abstract =     "In this article we provide an accessible account of
                 the essential idea behind cloaking, aimed at
                 nonspecialists and undergraduates who have had some
                 vector calculus, Fourier series, and linear algebra.
                 The goal of cloaking is to render an object invisible
                 to detection from electromagnetic energy by surrounding
                 the object with a specially engineered ``metamaterial''
                 that redirects electromagnetic waves around the object.
                 We show how to cloak an object against detection from
                 impedance tomography, an imaging technique of much
                 recent interest, though the mathematical ideas apply to
                 much more general forms of imaging. We also include
                 some exercises and ideas for undergraduate research
                 projects.",
