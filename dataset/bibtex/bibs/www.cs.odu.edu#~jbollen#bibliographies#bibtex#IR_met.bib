journal = {Decision Support Systems},
volume = {27},
number = {1-2},
pages = {5--24},
month = {November},
year = {1999},
abstract = {A dual-method model and system for filtering and ranking relevance of information is presented. One method is cognitive filtering, while the other is sociological filtering, which is integrated with user stereotypes. A prototype system was developed to test the applicability of the model for filtering e-mail messages, and experiments were run to determine the effects of combining the two methods in various filtering strategies. Results reveal that although cognitive filtering alone is usually more effective than sociological filtering alone, the combination of both methods yield better results than using each method individually. Ordinarily, the best filtering strategies are achieved when the two methods are used in parallel, or when cognitive filtering is the primary method, followed by sociological filtering. We conclude that the optimal filtering strategy of combining cognitive and sociological filtering is stereotype dependent; i.e., for each user stereotype, there may be a specific combination of the cognitive and sociological filtering that yields best results.

  year = 1997,
  title = {Information Filtering Via Hill-Climbing, Wordnet, and Index
          Patterns},
  journal = {Information Processing and Management},
  volume = 33,
  number = 5,
  pages = {633-644},
  abstract = {The recent growth of the Internet has left many users awash in a
             sea of information. This development has spawned the need for
             intelligent filtering systems. This paper describes work
             implemented in the INFOS (Intelligent News Filtering
             Organizational System) project that is designed to to reduce the
             user's search burden by automatically categorizing data as
             relevant or irrelevant based upon user interests. These
             predictions are learned automatically based upon features taken
             from input articles and collaborative features derived from other
             users. The filtering is performed by a hybrid technique that
             combines elements of a keyword-based hill climbing method,
             knowledge-based conceptual representation via WordNet, and
             partial parsing via index patterns. The Hybrid system integrating
             all these approaches benefits of each while maintaining
             robustness and scalability.}

  abstract = {A neural network's unsupervised learning algorithm,
                  Kohonen's feature map, is applied to constructing a
                  self-organizing semantic map for information
                  retrieval. The semantic map visualizes semantic
                  relationships between input documents, and has
                  properties of economic representation of data with
                  their interrelationships. The potentials of the
                  semantic map include using a map as a retrieval
                  interface for an on-line bibliographic system. A
                  prototype system that demonstrates this potential is
                  described.
