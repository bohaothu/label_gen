                  researchers from the XML, programming language, and
                  database communities. XML is already a de-facto
                  industry standard for data exchange, it has from an
                  early stage been embraced by database researchers,
                  and it is gaining increasing interest from
                  programming language researchers.\bibpar At this
                  workshop we hope to present recent results, identify
                  new challenges, and inspire the programming language
                  community to focus on XML.\bibpar The focus of the
                  workshop is on methods, tools, and theories for
                  processing XML. Example topics include (but are not
                  limited to) XML parsing, XML type system and
                  schemas, analysis and implementation of technologies
                  such as XPath, XSLT, and XQuery, and integration of
                  XML in both general-purpose and domain-specific
                  programming languages.",
