Over the last 25 years, {HRV} analysis has became more and more popular as a non-invasive research and clinical tool for indirectly investigating both cardiac and autonomic nervous system {(ANS)} function in both health and disease area. How the musical rhythmic characteristics, tempo and complexity, affect the performance of {HRV} is studied in this work. By understanding the relationship between music and the function of {ANS}, we can improve our life and health by music – non-invasively and simply.},

Built on top of our existing {MobiCare} technology and using an adaptation of the Fox and Haskell formula for exercise, we have set up an exercise monitor on the mobile phone that will help an individual achieve a certain goal that he or she wants from doing exercise. It could be something simple like better overall cardio fitness or something much more like losing weight. Once the goals and personal information are set for the individual, our exercise monitor program will advise users to achieve the maximal benefits of their exercise without going beyond their own limits. This will be beneficial to people who already have some difficulties to begin their exercise regime. This sports exercise monitor program will help them to gradually increase their duration and adaptation on physical activities and ultimately their general overall fitness.},

	abstract = {Interval training is a well known exercise protocol which helps strengthen and improve one's cardiovascular fitness. It interleaves high intensity exercises with rest periods. Despite the known benefits, proper scheduling and completion of interval training routines are not easy to perform. For example, without expensive equipment such as a treadmill, there is almost no way to figure out one's speed for proper imitation of a given exercise protocol, and thus interval training is heavily dependent on individual motivation levels. In this work, we use behavioral cueing using music and performance feedback to provide motivation during interval training exercise sessions. We have developed an application program on the popular {iPhone} platform. Our game-like and social networking application guides the user using exercise music. By measuring performance of the user through sensor readings, specifically accelerometers embedded in the {iPhone}, we are able to play the right song to match the user's workout plan. A hybrid of a collaborative, content, and context-aware filtering algorithm incorporates the user's music preferences and the exercise speed that will enhance performance. Additionally, adherence to an exercise protocol and the amount of calories burned is translated into a score that is sent to the user's social network group.},

Recommendations by the Finnish National Nutrition Council are used as the nutritional basis for the service. {HyperFit} uses a food database that contains the nutritional information for approximately 2,500 food products and categories, both product-specific and average. Hybrid media combining print and mobile technology are applied to improve the usability and arouse interest. The service is used both with a mobile phone and {PC.} A camera phone can be used to add food and exercise entries to the diaries by reading product barcodes. {HyperFit} has been tested with potential individual users, weight management groups and nutritionists' counseling clients in several field trials. Participants of the trials have been content with the system. The trials suggest that a {HyperFit} type of service can be used to promote independent weight management and the use of hybrid media gives extra value to the service.

	abstract = {In this paper, exercise management systems have been introduced, which are generally used to optimize exercise. They create a proper exercise program via an exercise prescription based on the personal physical status of the user. However, exercise programs, generally created at intervals of two weeks to three months, are static and cannot reflect the user's exercise goals, which change dynamically. This paper proposes context-aware exercise architecture {(CAEA)}, which provides an exercise program via a dynamic exercise prescription based on awareness of the user's status. We use sensors of a U-health environment and implement {CAEA} as an intelligent fitness guide {(IFG)} system. The {IFG} system selectively receives necessary parameters as input according to the user's exercise goals. Based on the changes in the user's exercise type, frequency, and intensity, the system creates an exercise program via an exercise optimization algorithm. In this paper, to show the exercise efficiency using the {IFG} system, we compared a noncontrol group to a control group. An eight-week study was performed comparing the changes of body weight in the two study groups. The study showed that the control group using the {IFG} system approached the desired body weight 2.57\% more closely than the noncontrol group. Since {IFG} provides a real-time exercise program for users via an exercise optimization algorithm, it enables the user to perform effective and stable exercise according to the user's physical status.},

However, the playlist in mobile devices are predefined and independent of the jogger's pace. Whenever the user wants to change the music that is playing, they have to stop exercising and push buttons on the device. In this paper, we introduce a novel service that provides the jogger with a smart music player agent to reduce the effort required to control the mobile device. This system involves music filtration and pace prediction technologies. An artificial neural networks that can filter out undesired music is used as the kernel of the music filter. Pace prediction is based on hidden Markov models {(HMM)}, and similar pattern searching techniques are used to select music that has a suitable tempo. A series of experiments were carried out to demonstrate the performance of this system. The results show that this unique service is attractive to joggers.},

The {IHDPMA} provides a semantic analysis of healthy diet status for people based on the pre-constructed ontology by domains experts and results of fuzzy inference. With the generated semantic analysis, people can get healthy information about what they eat and make it easier to eat a balanced and healthy diet.

Hence, behavioral change towards healthy lifestyles is one of the keys to health care cost containment. Personal health systems {(PHS)} offer tools to support behavioral change. As health risks, personal needs and preferences vary from an individual to another, personalization of the {PHS} is needed. In Nuadu project we have developed a {PHS} integrating several different personal health technologies. This system was studied in a large {(N=354)} randomized controlled trial where employees with several health risks participated in a health promotion program. The study will finish in June 2009. User feedback and technology usage logs reveal that especially simple mobile technologies were actively used during the program. However, usage models varied between individuals and time, and there was a significant number of both active users and non-users. The results emphasize that "one size" does not fit all, and instead of individual "killer applications", {PHS} with different personalizable and interoperable options should be developed. In addition, screening and profiling methods should be developed to identify those users who would best accept and benefit from technology-supported health promotion. Successful technologies combine high usability and conceptual simplicity to clear and perceivable added value for the end users.},

Using information and communication technologies {(ICT)} and especially mobile {eHealth} applications is a promising way of improving user-friendliness and possibly the overall effectiveness of self-monitoring. Mobility as such brings the added value of continuous availability and timely information access. One additional benefit of {ICT} based solutions is the possibility for various types of customization, allowing support for a wider set of application requirements than was originally planned, and meeting changing needs and targets of individuals, groups or larger user segments. In this paper, we present a customizable mobile application for recording and managing health related self-observations, Wellness Diary, and the ideas and technical solutions for supporting tailoring of the application. The main idea is to allow end-users to freely change the data model in the application, and customize related data presentations. This work has been done in Nuadu {ITEA} project, as well as further work where the effectiveness of the mobile tool and other {ICT} technologies will be investigated in a controlled trial in Finland. We'll also present shortly a counterpart for the mobile application, a web service that should bring some added value for the end user.},

In the proposed approach, firstly, the nutrition facts of various kinds of food are collected from the Internet and the convenience store. Next, the domain experts construct the type-2 fuzzy ontology, then the involved volunteers are requested to input eaten items. Finally, the proposed agent displays the diet assessment of the input eaten items based on the constructed type-2 fuzzy ontology. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible for diet assessment.},

	abstract = {To enhancing the exercise effect, exercise management systems are introduced and generally used. They create the proper exercise program through exercise prescription after determining the personal body status. But, exercise programs, are created at 2 weeks{\textbackslash}textasciitilde3months intervals, are very static and can't respect with person's exercise habit or cycle that is dynamically changed. If exercise period is long, exercise effect will diminishing. This paper proposed Context Aware Exercise Environment {(CAEE)}, provides an Exercise Program through recalculation of exercise prescription after user's situation awareness, and designs the {CAEE} as Intelligent Fitness Guide {(IFG)} System. If exercise kinds, frequency and strength of user are changing, that system creates the exercise program through exercise optimization algorithm. As it {(IFG)} is providing the exercise program in a real time to users, it can be enabled the effective, stable exercise in user's physical body according to user situation.},

Behavior change is the key to managing well-being and preventing and managing chronic diseases. Wellness diary {(WD)} is a mobile application designed to support citizens in learning about their behavior, and both making and maintaining behavior changes. {WD} has been found acceptable, useful, and suitable for long-term use as a part of an intervention. When used independently, however, it does not seem to have enough engaging and motivating features to support adoption and long-term commitment. The main improvement needs identified based on a review of {WD-related} studies were: personalization of the application to individual needs, increasing motivation during early use, maintaining motivation, and aiding in relapse recovery in long-term use. We present concepts to improve the personalization of {WD} as well as improvements to the feedback and interpretation of the self-observation data. We also present usage models on how this type of mobile application could be utilized.},

Obesity has been found to increase the risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. Due to the many health risks associated with obesity, an increase in prevalence has also pressured health care systems and the finances of the individual. Our research proposes to decrease obesity prevalence in adults by motivating teens to become or continue being physically active so that they can continue these healthy lifestyles as adults. Our goal is to encourage long term adoption of physically active behaviors by introducing a motivating application running on a mobile device. We use the Technology Acceptance Model, the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Theory of Meaning Behavior, and the Big 5 Personality Theory to guide our design.},

	abstract = {Despite well-documented benefits of exercise, aging women remain largely sedentary. Further understanding of beliefs associated with exercise could result in more-effective public health interventions to increase exercise in this vulnerable population. This study examined the relationships between theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise behavior and exercise intention in older women. Constructs from the theory of planned behavior (behavioral beliefs, perceived control beliefs, and normative beliefs) were examined in a sample of 225 women aged 65 and older. Exercise was measured with the Baecke Physical Activity Scale. All women were interviewed, to prevent literacy and vision problems from hampering participation. Significant predictors of exercise behavior were perceived control beliefs and behavioral beliefs. Significant predictors of exercise intentions were perceived control beliefs, behavioral beliefs, and normative beliefs. Specific belief items predicting exercise behavior were that exercise is good for health and that exercise is difficult because of tiredness, as well as the lack of commitment and time. These findings provide partial support for the application of the theory of planned behavior to exercise in older women. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on increasing women's confidence that they can overcome barriers to exercise.},
