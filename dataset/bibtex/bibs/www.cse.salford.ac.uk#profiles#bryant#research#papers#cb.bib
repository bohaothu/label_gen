        ABSTRACT = "This is the first published work to compare the
                  performance of object and object relational database
                  systems based on the object's complexity. The
                  findings of this research show that the performance
                  of object and object relational database systems are
                  related to the complexity of the object in use.
                  Object relational databases have better performance
                  compared to object databases for fundamental
                  database operations, with the exception of insert
                  operations, on objects with low and medium
                  complexity. For objects with high complexity, the
                  object relational databases have better performance
                  for update and delete operations."}

        ABSTRACT = "BACKGROUND: Some upstream open reading frames
                  (uORFs) regulate gene expression (i.e., they are
                  functional) and can play key roles in keeping
                  organisms healthy. However, how uORFs are involved
                  in gene regulation is not yet fully understood. In
                  order to get a complete view of how uORFs are
                  involved in gene regulation, it is expected that a
                  large number of experimentally verified functional
                  uORFs are needed. Unfortunately, wet-experiments to
                  verify that uORFs are functional are expensive.

                  RESULTS: In this paper, a new computational approach
                  to predicting functional uORFs in the yeast
                  Saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented. Our approach
                  is based on inductive logic programming and makes
                  use of a novel combination of knowledge about
                  biological conservation, Gene Ontology annotations
                  and genes' responses to different conditions. Our
                  method results in a set of simple and informative
                  hypotheses with an estimated sensitivity of 76\%. The
                  hypotheses predict 301 further genes to have 398
                  novel functional uORFs. Three (RPC11, TPK1, and
                  FOL1) of these 301 genes have been hypothesised,
                  following wet-experiments, by a related study to
                  have functional uORFs. A comparison with another
                  related study suggests that eleven of the predicted
                  functional uORFs from genes LDB17, HEM3, CIN8, BCK2,
                  PMC1, FAS1, APP1, ACC1, CKA2, SUR1, and ATH1 are
                  strong candidates for wet-lab experimental studies.

                  CONCLUSIONS: Learning based prediction of functional
                  uORFs can be done with a high sensitivity. The
                  predictions made in this study can serve as a list
                  of candidates for subsequent wet-lab verification
                  and might help to elucidate the regulatory roles of
                  uORFs."}

                  empirically investigates whether providing an ILP
                  system with predicted mRNA secondary structure can
                  increase the performance of the resulting rules. Two

                  structure predictions as part of the background

                  positive-only clause evaluation function within the
                  context of learning biological grammars.  To
                  overcome this shortcoming we propose L-modification,
                  a modification to this evaluation function such that
                  the lengths of individual examples are considered.
                  We use a set of bio-sequences known as neuropeptide
                  precursor middles (NPP-middles).  Using
                  L-modification to learn from these NPP-middles
                  results in induced grammars that have a better
                  performance than that achieved when using the
                  standard positive-only clause evaluation function.
                  We also show that L-modification improves the
                  performance of induced grammars when learning on
                  short, medium or long NPPs-middles.  A potential
                  disadvantage of L-modification is discussed.
                  Finally, we show that, as the limit on the search

                  predictive performance arising from L-modification.

        ABSTRACT = "We are interested in using Inductive Logic
                    Programming (ILP) to infer grammars representing
                    sets of biological sequences.  We call these
                    biological grammars.  ILP systems are well suited
                    to this task in the sense that biological grammars
                    have been represented as logic programs using the
                    Definite Clause Grammar or the String Variable
                    Grammar formalisms.  However, the speed at which
                    ILP systems can generate biological grammars has
                    been shown to be a bottleneck.  This paper
                    presents a novel refinement operator
                    implementation, specialised to infer biological
                    grammars with ILP techniques.  This implementation

                    compared to the use of the classical refinement
                    operator: time gains larger than 5-fold were
                    observed in 4/5 of the experiments, and the
                    maximum observed gain is over 300-fold."}

          to model biological sequences families. As both the quantity
          of biological sequences and the complexity of the biological
          grammars increase, generic and efficient methods for parsing
          are needed.  We consider two parsers for context-free
          grammars: depth-first top-down parser and chart parser; we
          analyse and compare them, both theoretically and
          empirically, with respect to biological data.  The
          theoretical comparison is based on a common feature of
          biological grammars: the gap - a gap is an element of the
          grammars designed to match any subsequence of the parsed
          string. The empirical comparison is based on grammars and
          sequences used by the bioinformatics community.  Our
          conclusions are that: (1) the chart parsing algorithm is
          significantly faster than the depth-first top-down a
          lgorithm, (2) designing special treatments in the algorithms
          for managing gaps is useful, and (3) the way the grammar
          encodes gaps has to be carefully chosen, when using parsers
          not optimised for managing gaps, to prevent important
          increases in running times."}

          a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify
          hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the
          cycle. Here we apply the system to the determination of gene
          function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces
          cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments. We built and
          tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins
          and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis
          pathway. In biological experiments that automatically
          reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent
          experiment selection strategy is competitive with human
          performance and significantly outperforms, with a cost
          decrease of 3-fold and 100-fold (respectively), both
          cheapest and random-experiment selection."}

        ABSTRACT = "With the completion of the sequencing of genomes
           of increasing numbers of organisms, the focus of biology is
           moving to determining the role of these genes (functional
           genomics). To this end it is useful to view the cell as a
           biochemical machine: it consumes simple molecules to
           manufacture more complex ones by chaining together
           biochemical reactions into long sequences referred to as
           {\em metabolic pathways}. Such metabolic pathways are not
           linear but often interesect to form complex networks. Genes
           play a fundamental role in these networks by providing the
           information to synthesise the enzymes that catalyse
           biochemical reactions. Although developing a complete
           model of metabolism is of fundamental importance to biology
           and medicine, the size and complexity of the network has
           proven beyond the capacity of human reasoning. This paper
           presents the first results of the Robot Scientist research
           programme that aims to automatically discover the function
           of genes in the metabolism of the yeast {\em Saccharomyces
           cerevisiae}. Results include: (1) the first logical model
           of metabolism; (2) a method to predict phenotype by
           deductive inference; and (3) a method to infer reactions
           and gene function by aductive inference. We describe the
           {\em in vivo} experimental set-up which will allow these
           {\em in silico} predictions to be automatically tested by a
           laboratory robot."}

          interest in biomolecular genetics and also to biomolecular
          geneticists interested in what AI tools may do for them.
          The authors are engaged in a collaborative enterprise aimed
          at partially automating some aspects of scientific
          work. These aspects include the processes of forming
          hypotheses, devising trials to discriminate between these
          competing hypotheses, physically performing these trials and
          then using the results of these trials to converge upon an
          accurate hypothesis. As a potential component of the
          reasoning carried out by an ``artificial scientist'' this
          paper describes ASE-Progol, an Active Learning system which
          uses Inductive Logic Programming to construct hypothesised
          first-order theories and uses a CART-like algorithm to
          select trials for eliminating ILP derived hypotheses.  In
          simulated yeast growth tests ASE-Progol was used to
          rediscover how genes participate in the aromatic amino acid
          pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The cost of the
          chemicals consumed in converging upon a hypothesis with an
          accuracy of around $88\%$ was reduced by five orders of
          magnitude when trials were selected by ASE-Progol rather
          than being sampled at random. While the naive strategy of
          always choosing the cheapest trial from the set of candidate
          trials led to lower cumulative costs than ASE-Progol, both
          the naive strategy and the random strategy took
          significantly longer to converge upon a final hypothesis
          than ASE-Progol.  For example to reach an accuracy of
          $80\%$, ASE-Progol required 4 days while random sampling
          required 6 days and the naive strategy required 10 days."}

        ABSTRACT = "This paper investigates whether Chomsky-like
         grammar representations are useful for learning
         cost-effective, comprehensible predictors of members of
         biological sequence families.  The Inductive Logic
         Programming (ILP) Bayesian approach to learning from positive
         examples is used to generate a grammar for recognising a
         class of proteins known as human neuropeptide precursors
         (NPPs).  Collectively, five of the co-authors of this paper,
         have extensive expertise on NPPs and general bioinformatics
         methods. Their motivation for generating a NPP grammar was
         that none of the existing bioinformatics methods could
         provide sufficient cost-savings during the search for new
         NPPs. Prior to this project experienced specialists at
         SmithKline Beecham had tried for many months to hand-code
         such a grammar but without success. Our best predictor makes
         the search for novel NPPs {\bf more than 100 times more
         efficient} than randomly selecting proteins for synthesis and
         testing them for biological activity.  As far as these
         authors are aware, this is both the first biological grammar
         learnt using ILP and the first real-world scientific
         application of the ILP Bayesian approach to learning from
         positive examples. A group of features is derived from this
         grammar. Other groups of features of NPPs are derived using
         other learning strategies.  Amalgams of these groups are
         formed. A recognition model is generated for each amalgam
         using C4.5 and C4.5rules and its performance is measured
         using both predictive accuracy and a new cost function, {\em
         Relative Advantage} ($RA$). The highest $RA$ was achieved by
         a model which includes grammar-derived features. This $RA$ is
         significantly higher than the best $RA$ achieved without the
         use of the grammar-derived features. Predictive accuracy is
         not a good measure of performance for this domain because it
         does not discriminate well between NPP recognition models:
         despite covering varying numbers of (the rare) positives, all
         the models are awarded a similar (high) score by predictive
         accuracy because they all exclude most of the abundant
         negatives."}

        ABSTRACT = "The main real-world applications of Inductive
        Logic Programming (ILP) to date involve the ``Observation
        Predicate Learning'' (OPL) assumption, in which both the
        examples and hypotheses define the same predicate. However, in
        both scientific discovery and language learning potential
        applications exist in which OPL does not hold.  OPL is
        ingrained within the theory and performance testing of Machine
        Learning.  A general ILP technique called ``Theory Completion
        using Inverse Entailment'' (TCIE) is introduced which is
        applicable to non-OPL applications.  TCIE is based on inverse
        entailment and is closely allied to abductive inference. The
        implementation of TCIE within Progol5.0 is described. The
        implementation uses contra-positives in a similar way to
        Stickel's Prolog Technology Theorem Prover.  Progol5.0 is
        tested on two different data-sets.  The first dataset involves
        a grammar which translates numbers to their representation in
        English. The second dataset involves hypothesising the
        function of unknown genes within a network of metabolic
        pathways. On both datasets near complete recovery of
        performance is achieved after relearning when randomly chosen
        portions of background knowledge are removed.  Progol5.0's
        running times for experiments in this paper were typically
        under 6 seconds on a standard laptop PC."}

                   typically open loop, with no direct link between

                   paper describes the alternative, {\it Closed Loop
                   Machine Learning}.  This is related to the area of
                   Active Learning in which the ML system actively
                   selects experiments to discriminate between

                   Learning the system not only selects but also

                   ASE-Progol, a Closed Loop Machine Learning system,

        ABSTRACT = "This paper demonstrates how general purpose tools
                   from the field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
                   can be applied to analytical chemistry. As far as
                   these authors are aware, this is the first
                   published work to describe the application of the
                   ILP tool Golem to separation science.

                   An outline of the theory of ILP is given, together
                   with a description of Golem and previous
                   applications of ILP. The advantages of ILP over
                   classical machine induction techniques, such as the
                   Top-Down-Induction-of-Decision-Tree family, are
                   explained.

                   A case-study is then presented in which Golem is
                   used to induce rules which predict, with a high
                   accuracy (82\%), whether each of a series of
                   attempted separations succeed or fail. The
                   separation data was obtained from published work on
                   the attempted separation of a series of
                   3-substituted phthalide enantiomer pairs on
                   (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-phenylglycine."}

                  formal specifications of requirements, drawing a
                  parallel with research into the validation of
                  knowledge bases. Using an industrial-scale case
                  study we describe a partially implemented,
                  integrated environment for validating requirements
                  stated in many-sorted first order logic. In
                  particular, we show how techniques from machine
                  learning can be used to provide extra tool-support
                  for the validation process."}

                   was used in an attempt to automate the acquisition
                   of the knowledge needed for an expert system for
                   enantioseparations by High Performance Liquid
                   Chromatography using Pirkle-type chiral stationary
                   phases (CSPs). Various rule-sets were induced that
                   recommended particular CSP chiral selectors based
                   on the structural features of an enantiomer
                   pair. The results suggest that the accuracy of the
                   optimal rule-set is 63\% + or - 3\% which is
                   more than ten times greater than the accuracy that
                   would have resulted from a random choice."}

        ABSTRACT = "Expert systems for chromatography are reviewed. A
                   taxonomy is proposed that allows present (and
                   future) expert systems in this area to be
                   classified and facilitates an understanding of
                   their inter-relationship. All the systems are
                   described focusing on the reasons for their
                   development, what their purpose was and how they
                   were to be used. The engineering methods, knowledge
                   representations, tools and architectures used for
                   the systems are compared and contrasted in a
                   discussion covering all the stages of the
                   development life cycle of expert systems. The
                   review reveals that too often developers of expert
                   systems for chromatography do not justify their
                   decisions on engineering matters and that the
                   literature suggests that many ideas advocated by
                   knowledge engineers are not being used."}
