abstract = "-The objective of this paper is to use the method of the vector control in the direction of the rotor flux indirectly for induction motors. The space vector of the stator current is divided into two components: magnetizing current and torque-producing current. By using the uniform pulse width modulated inverter, torque pulsation will be reduced and a robust control with quick dynamic response for induction motor is achieved. The computer simulation results show that the performance of the vector control of the induction motor is exactly the same as the performance of the separately excited DC motor",

abstract = "-Abstract: A simple methodology for computation of shielding effectiveness (SE) of conducting enclosures with apertures under external illumination is proposed. The methodology is suitable for prediction of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the final product in the design stage. The exterior and interior regions of the enclosure are analyzed separately by employing the boundary conditions of Bethe's small aperture coupling theory [1]. The electric and magnetic SE of the enclosures is discretized using the finite elements method (FEM). Selected numerical results for the shielding effectiveness of rectangular cavity with apertures calculated by the new methodology are provided and compared with measured published data in order to show the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed approach.

abstract = "-Abstract: This paper presents a new adaptive power system stabiliser able to provide acceptable damping over a wide range of operating points. The control strategy is based on a new adaptive technique named Pole-Zero Assignment Controller (PZAC) in which a particular power system transfer function (G(d)(s) = Deltadelta/DeltaP(m)) is modified to a standard form based on an explicit system identification. Controller design is mainly based on continuous-time system because of using the delta operator rather than the more usual shift operator. Simulation studies Performed on a multimachine model are presented. Results clearly show the benefits of the proposed adaptive controller for stability, enhancement of a power system, especially where there are large changes in operating point. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
