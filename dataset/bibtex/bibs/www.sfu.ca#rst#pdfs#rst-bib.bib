   Abstract="Presents the results of an anlysis of the RST structures of eight Dutch and eight English fund-raising letters from NPO's. Three classes of relation were observed: interpersonal, ideational, and textual. The American letters showed a higher use of the interpersonal relations, whereas the Dutch letters used more of the ideational and textual relations, leading to the conclusion that the Dutch letters are organised with a greater emphasis on clarity than outright persuasion."

   Abstract="This paper presents a methodology for summarization from multiple documents which are about a specific topic. It is based on the specification and identification of the cross-document relations that occur among textual elements within those documents. Our methodology involves the specification of the topic-specific entities, the messages conveyed for the specific entities by certain textual elements and the specification of the relations that can hold among these messages. The above resources are necessary for setting up a specific topic for our query-based summarization approach which uses these resources to identify the query-specific messages within the documents and the query-specific relations that connect these messages across documents."

   Abstract="Objective: The aim of this paper is to survey the recent work in medical documents summarization. Background: During the last decade, documents summarization got increasing attention by the Al research community. More recently it also attracted the interest of the medical research community as well, due to the enormous growth of information that is available to the physicians and researchers in medicine, through the large and growing number of published journals, conference proceedings, medical sites and portals on the World Wide Web, electronic medical records, etc. Methodology: This survey gives first a general background on documents summarization, presenting the factors that summarization depends upon, discussing evaluation issues and describing briefly the various types of summarization techniques. It then examines the characteristics of the medical domain through the different types of medical documents. Finally, it presents and discusses the summarization techniques used so far in the medical domain, referring to the corresponding systems and their characteristics. Discussion and conclusions: The paper discusses thoroughly the promising paths for future research in medical documents summarization. It mainly focuses on the issue of scaling to large collections of documents in various Languages and from different media, on personalization issues, on portability to new sub-domains, and on the integration of summarization technology in practical applications.

   Abstract="In this paper we present a fresh look at the problem of summarizing evolving events from multiple sources. After a discussion concerning the nature of evolving events we introduce a distinction between linearly and non-linearly evolving events. We present then a general methodology for the automatic creation of summaries from evolving events. At its heart lie the notions of Synchronic and Diachronic cross-document Relations (SDRs), whose aim is the identification of similarities and differences between sources, from a synchronical and diachronical perspective. SDRs do not connect documents or textual elements found therein, but structures one might call messages. Applying this methodology will yield a set of messages and relations, SDRs, connecting them, that is a graph which we call grid. We will show how such a grid can be considered as the starting point of a Natural Language Generation System. The methodology is evaluated in two case-studies, one for linearly evolving events (descriptions of football matches) and another one for non-linearly evolving events (terrorist incidents involving hostages). In both cases we evaluate the results produced by our computational systems."

M-PIRO is developing technology that allows personalized multilingual object descriptions, in both textual and spoken form, to be produced from symbolic information in a database and small fragments of text. The technology is being tested in the context of electronic museums, where a prototype that produces dynamically multilingual exhibit descriptions for presentations over the web has already been developed. This paper focuses on M-PIRO's authoring subsystem, which allows domain experts with no language technology expertise to configure the system for new applications. The authoring facilities allow the experts to define or modify the structure of the underlying database, its contents, and the system's domain-dependent linguistic resources. Previews of the generated texts can also be produced during the authoring process to monitor the content and quality of the resulting descriptions."

   Abstract="We describe here the conceptual design of Cicero, an application-independent human-computer interaction manager that performs run-time media coordination and allocation, so as to adapt dynamically to the presentation context; knows what it is presenting, so as to maintain coherent extended human-machine dialogues; and is plug-in compatible with host information resources such as ''briefing associate'' workstations, expert systems, databases, etc., as well as with multiple media such as natural language, graphics, etc. The system design calls for two linked reactive planners that coordinate the actions of the system's media and information sources. To enable presentational flexibility, the capabilities of each medium and the nature of the contents of each information source are semantically modeled as Virtual Devices - abstract descriptions of device I/O capabilities - and abstract information types respectively in a single uniform knowledge representation framework. These models facilitate extensibility by supporting the specification of new interaction behaviors and the inclusion of new media and information sources."

   Journal="Scientometrics",
   Volume=75,
   Number=2,
   Pages="203-238",
   Abstract="Recently, philosophers of science have argued that the epistemological requirements of different scientific fields lead necessarily to differences in scientific method. In this paper, we examine possible variation in how language is used in peer-reviewed journal articles from various fields to see if features of such variation may help to elucidate and support claims of methodological variation among the sciences. We hypothesize that significant methodological differences will be reflected in related differences in scientists' language style. This paper reports a corpus-based study of peer-reviewed articles from twelve separate journals in six fields of experimental and historical sciences. Machine learning methods were applied to compare the discourse styles of articles in different fields, based on easily-extracted linguistic features of the text. Features included function word frequencies, as used often in computational stylistics, as well as lexical features based on systemic functional linguistics, which affords rich resources for comparative textual analysis. We found that indeed the style of writing in the historical sciences is readily distinguishable from that of the experimental sciences. Furthermore, the most significant linguistic features of these distinctive styles are directly related to the methodological differences posited by philosophers of science between historical and experimental sciences, lending empirical weight to their contentions."

   Abstract="Investigates five RST relations (Evidence, Motivation, Justify, Antithesis, Concession) and their logical/pragmatic equivalents in the realm of argumentation (supportive, incentive, justifier, persuader (last two)) . Paper includes analyses of three sample texts.
Another: Rhetorical structure theory, as a tool for analyzing written texts, is particularly appropriate for analyzing argumentative texts. The distinction that rhetorical structure theory makes between the part of a text that realizes the primary goal of the writer, termed nucleus, & the part that provides supplementary material, termed satellite, is crucial for the analysis of argumentative texts. The paper commences by determining the concept of argument relation (argument + conclusion) & by briefly presenting rhetorical structure theory. It continues by identifying five of rhetorical structure theory's rhetorical relations of the satellite/nucleus schema (evidence, motivation, justify, antithesis, concession) as five argument relations, each being, logically or pragmatically, a special kind of argument: evidence is a supportive argument, motivation is an incentive argument, justify is a justifier argument, & antithesis & concession are persuader arguments. To illustrate, an analysis of three short texts concludes the paper. 4 Figures, 36 References. Adapted from the source document",

to this approach is the entity-grid representation of discourse, which captures patterns of entity
distribution in a text. The algorithm introduced in the article automatically abstracts a text
into a set of entity transition sequences and records distributional, syntactic, and referential
information about discourse entities. We re-conceptualize coherence assessment as a learning
task and show that our entity-based representation is well-suited for ranking-based generation
and text classification tasks. Using the proposed representation, we achieve good performance on
text ordering, summary coherence evaluation, and readability assessment",

   Abstract="A growing number of investigations into,the historical development and status of academic prose have found that many national languages lose both prestige and distribution as a medium of expression in the sciences, while English progressively develops into the lingua franca of science. The investigation presented in this paper starts from the assumption that the status of English as a global lingua franca not only replaces the use of other languages but that the prestige associated with English styles of scientific writing can also influence text production in other languages in the sense that indigenous language-and culture-specific communicative conventions are superseded by the conventions operative in comparable English texts. Taking the example of macrosyntactic conjunction with and and und in English and German popular scientific texts, this article addresses the question of whether German communicative conventions are adapted to English communicative styles such that language-specific strategies of information organization in German change in the direction of English."

   Pages="535-565",
   Abstract="Spoken tutorial discourse is argued to be describable in terms of topic or information hierarchies that can be linked via a finite series of rhetorical relations or "pedagogic discourse strategies." The dialogue from British university tutorials in physics & English literature was used to (1) explore a model of knowledge structuring in spoken tutorial interaction, (2) provide a formal description of how knowledge is structured in two contrastive subject (science & art) tutorials, & (3) describe how this structuring relates in predictable ways to subject methodology. Here the American Rhetorical Structure Theory of W. C. Mann & S. Thompson (1985, 1986, & 1992), generally applied to coherent texts, was used as a starting point for development of a spoken discourse framework with provisions for repetition & for the consequences of clarification or repair. Data were gathered from a physics tutorial & an English literature tutorial, each lasting one hour, involving 8 & 6 students, respectively. Whereas the physics tutorial was characterized by a global pattern of subordination or recursive embedding, the English literature tutorial reflected a coordination of issues. Each tutorial was therefore seen to reflect the core structure of its discipline, the physics tutorial an atomistic process involving accretion of knowledge by pieces, & the English tutorial revealing an organic or holistic structure. 3 Figures, 43 References.

   Abstract="This paper presents some research undertaken as part of the EU-funded HOMEY project, into the application of intelligent dialogue systems to healthcare systems. The work presented here concentrates on the ways in which knowledge of underlying task structure (e.g., a medical guideline) can be combined with ontological knowledge (e.g., medical semantic dictionaries) to provide a basis for the automatic generation of flexible and re-configurable dialogue. This approach is next evaluated via a specific application that provides decision support to general practitioners to help determine whether or not a patient should be referred to a cancer specialist. The competence of the resulting dialogue application, its speech recognition performance, and dialogue performance are all evaluated to determine the applicability of this approach.

   Abstract="A major limiting factor in the acceptability of interactive guideline and decision support systems is the case of use of the system in the clinic. A way to reduce demands upon users and increase flexibility of the interface is to use natural language dialogues and speech based interfaces. This paper describes a voice-based data capture and decision support system in which knowledge of underlying task structure (a medical guideline) and domain knowledge (disease ontologies and semantic dictionaries) are integrated with dialogue models based on conversational game theory resulting in a flexible and configurable interface."

   Abstract="This paper investigates the use. of abstract task specifications for dialogue management in the medical domain. In most current dialogue systems, possible interactions with the system are hand-coded in the design. This is an expensive process, especially for complex dialogues. This paper motivates the use of a task description language for building flexible and adaptive dialogue systems in ontologically rich domains such as medicine. It describes the components of a task specification, and proposes an architecture for dialogue systems which al-lows integration of domain reasoning and dialogue. A high-level dialogue specification is used to support multimodal input and output, including generation of HTML pages, and generation of fragments of VoiceXML for spoken in-teraction."

   Journal="Journal of Linguistics",
   Volume=43,
   Number=2,
   Pages="311-339",
   Abstract="The classification of that is, or (in other words), and or rather as reformulation markers would seem to suggest that the utterances they introduce achieve relevance in the same way. However, the examination of a range of discrepancies between reformulations introduced by or, on the one hand, and reformulations introduced by that is, on the other, suggests that any account of the pragmatics of reformulation must be a non-unitary one. In this paper, I build on Burton-Roberts' (1993) suggestion that the reformulations introduced by or are meta-linguistic in character, and show how these can be distinguished from the reformulations introduced by that is, which must be analysed at the level of conceptual representation. I also show how this distinction corresponds to a distinction between the different ways in which a parenthetical construction may be pragmatically integrated with its host. As Potts (2005) would predict, parenthetical that is-reformulations are not themselves part of the truth-conditional content of their hosts. However, in contrast with or-reformulations, they communicate information about the propositional content of their hosts, and in this way can contribute to the identification of their truth-conditional content at the level of pragmatic interpretation."

   Abstract="Research on writing has been greatly stimulated by cognitive psychology, in which writing has been conceptualized as a problem solving activity. The objective of this paper is to critically analyze some aspects of the cognitive approach to writing and writing instruction: (1) the effects of problem solving analogy in writing research; (2) the lack of a comprehensive theory of writing development; and (3) good vs. competent writing. In the cognitive approach the main objective of writing instruction is to make the pupil into a strategic writer, whereas writing itself is viewed as subordinate to learning and thinking. The concept of writing expertise is analyzed and some suggestions for research on writing instruction are discussed."

   Abstract="This paper describes a prototype Intelligent Teaching System aimed at improving Dutch university students' use of punctuation in writing and editing texts. Not only grammatical aspects of punctuation are considered, but also the effect of using different punctuation marks with respect to the rhetorical structure of the text. The system offers a student texts in which he should check the punctuation, and if necessary, make corrections. The system then analyses the student's answer and the differences with respect to possible correct solutions, and gives specific feedback based on these analyses. Formative evaluation of the prototype suggests that it has some advantages over using textbooks, because it allows students to understand the way punctuation actually works, rather than merely teaching prescriptive rules."

   Abstract="In three experiments, the demand that text processing imposes on learners' cognitive capacity was measured with a secondary-task technique. In all experiments, the meaning of the textual materials was held constant while several structural (surface) variables were manipulated. Experiment 1 showed that text versions with simplified vocabulary and syntax (but equivalent content) required less cognitive capacity to process than standard versions. Experiment 2 revealed that the reduction in use of cognitive capacity observed in Experiment 1 was due primarily to syntactic factors. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrated that texts containing signals about idea importance and idea relations required less cognitive capacity to process than texts with approximately the same propositional content, but no such signals. In each experiment, measures of total inspection time and content recall were also secured. In general, the findings of all three experiments indicated that aspects of the surface structure of text made demands on the reader's cognitive processing capacity."

   Abstract="This study describes and evaluates two essay-based discourse analysis systems that identify thesis and conclusion statements from student essays written on six different essay topics. Essays used to train and evaluate the systems were annotated by two human judges, according to a discourse annotation protocol. Using a machine learning approach, a number of discourse-related features were automatically extracted from a set of annotated training data. Using these features, two discourse analysis models were built using C5.0 with boosting: a topic-dependent and a topic-independent model. Both systems outperformed a positional algorithm. While the topic-dependent system showed somewhat higher performance, the topic-independent system showed similar results, indicating that a system can generalize to unseen data-that is, essay responses on topics that the system has not seen in training."

   Journal="Travail Humain",
   Volume=60,
   Number=4,
   Pages="409-437",
   Abstract="This paper deals with what are called here paralinguistic organizers i.e. textual devices like underlining, brackets, footnotes, and, on screen, pop upfields..., In the framework at he theory of discourse comprehension (Van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983) it is proposed to view technical texts as tools, more Or less efficient, that readers use to build their representation (situation model). it is known that the schematic superstructure of a text can significantly enhance its comprehension and memorization. It ir assumed here that another kind of text structure could play a similar role ie. the structure based on the main points/secondary points distinction. More generally a text can be viewed as a set of textual units, each one corresponding to a communicative intention of the writer In other terms, each textual unit has a propositionnal content and an illocutory value. The distinction of secondary points from the main points corresponds to a value of "importance minimization". Among secondary points, a number of more precise illocutory values can be found in technical texts such as commenting, illustrating, guiding the reading process, synthesizing... Our conjecture ii that a clear distinction by the reader of these illocutory values should contribute to text comprehension and memorization as well as information retrieval. Analyzing a corpus of various technical texts we built a typology of textual units on the basis of the writer' intentions. In order to test the cognitive reality of such a typology, subjects were requested to analyze texts dividing them into textual units and to categorize these units according to the typology, only opt the basis of language (the paralinguistic organizers were removed). The results showed that, except for subjects trained in text analysis (students in psycholinguistics), such a categorization was a difficult task. Paralinguistics organizers such as parenthesis, footnotes, and pop-up fields on screen, should play an important role signaling the writer's "minimization" intention when secondary points are concerned. In two experiments the effect of such paralinguistic organizers was studied Groups of subjects were requested to read the same text with and without organizers. The subjects had to read texts "from beginning to end" knowing that they would have to answer questions on the text The results did not confirm the common signification (minimization) of the studied organizers. Putting textual units in brackets or in footnotes did not decrease significantly their memorization; putting textual units in pop up fields increased their memorization. A final experiment investigated the role of pop up fields compared to brackets in an information retrieval task (in a small base of texts) as opposed to a a from beginning to ends reading task. The results showed that, in this kind of task, putting secondary pieces of information into pop up fields significantly speeded the search process compared to a condition in which the same information war displayed in brackets. In conclusion it is argued that selecting information is an important subprocess of text processing, even when reading from beginning to end. In parallel with the increasing production of electronic documents, research on typology of textuals units and on type-signaling devices is needed toward efficient "access structures" for technical texts."

   Pages="313-328",
   Abstract="This paper proposes a novel approach to automatic text segmentation without a full semantic understanding. in order to analyse the linguistic bonds and determine the degree of coherence that a text may exhibit, the tremendous diversity of textual relations in a discourse network is represented. A corpus of mutual linguistic knowledge that captures the similarity of meaning and causal relations is encoded in the discourse network, which is then subjected to a cluster algorithm. As a result, segments in the text are segregated into clusters according to their textual similarity. Topic boundaries in a text can be identified by observing the shifts of segments from one cluster to another. The experimental results show that the combination of the heterogeneous knowledge is capable of addressing the topic shifts. Comparison with a related method demonstrates that the algorithm is closely related to the topic boundaries. Given the increasing recognition of text structure in the fields of information retrieval in unpartitioned text, this approach provides a quantitative model and an efficient tool in text segmentation."

   Abstract="A shallow natural language processing approach to discourse structure detection based on the analysis of textual continuity is described. What distinguishes it from previous research is that it does not work toward on the discovery of the formal subtopic structures. In contrast, attention is focused in uncovering the main factors in textual continuity and simulating a dynamic detection mechanism of cohesive sentence-based fragments. A connectionist filtering algorithm is used to capture the textual continuity as one of the structural backbone of text. As a result, the content conveyed by text with discontinuous topic sequence is, on average, most unlikely to be included in the resultant discourse structure. A prototype and its evaluation with various statistics are included. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this paper, we provide a novel quantitative model for the creation of a summary by extracting a set of sentences that represent the most salient content of a text. The model is based on a shallow linguistic extraction technique. What distinguishes it from previous research is that it does not work on the detection of specific keywords or cue-phrases to evaluate the relevance of the sentence concerned. Instead, the attention is focused on the identification of the main factors in the textual continuity. Simulation experiments suggest that this technique is useful because it moves away from a purely keyword-based method of textual information extraction and its associated limitations.

In a preferred embodiment, a discourse structure recognition facility utilizes syntactic information associated with the body of text to generate a discourse structure tree that characterizes the discourse structure of the body of text. The facility first identifies in the body of text a number of clauses. The facility then determines, for each distinct pair of clauses, which of a number of possible discourse relations should be hypothesized between the pair of clauses, based on the syntactic structure and semantic of the body of text relative to the pair of clauses. The facility then applies the hypothesized relations to the clauses in order to produce a discourse structure tree characterizing the discourse structure of the body of text. In certain embodiments, the facility further generates from the produced discourse structure tree a synopsis of the body of text reflecting the primary goals pursued by its author."

The architecture of a summarisation system is presented on which evaluations intended to evidence the contribution of each module in the final result are performed and discussed."

   Volume=15,

   Pages="384-414",
   Abstract="The content of real-world databases, knowledge bases, database models, and formal specifications is often highly redundant and needs to be aggregated before these representations can be successfully paraphrased into natural language. To generate natural language from these representations, a number of processes must be carried out, one of which is sentence planning where the task of aggregation is carried out. Aggregation, which has been called ellipsis or coordination in Linguistics, is the process that removes redundancies during generation of a natural language discourse, without losing any information. The article describes a set of corpus studies that focus on aggregation, provides a set of aggregation rules, and finally, shows how these rules are implemented in a couple of prototype systems. We develop further the concept of aggregation and discuss it in connection with the growing literature on the subject. This work offers a new tool for the sentence planning phase of natural language generation systems."

We start by illustrating the two-step approach employed in the first version of the natural language generator and the limitations of generated texts, that we discovered through analytical and empirical evaluations. We claim that, although style refinement would be needed in these texts, particular care should be devoted to implementing some of the persuasion techniques that doctors employ in their explanations. This would require either thoroughly revising the text planning techniques employed or converting to a multistep generation architecture. We justify why we selected this second alternative and propose some heuristics to repair problems found in the first version of the generator. Some final considerations about the advantages of this approach and the possibility of generalizing it to other domains conclude the paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

   Pages="39-51",
   Abstract="This study focuses on the impact of linguistic markers of coherence on the comprehension of expository discourse. The impact of such markers on comprehension (i.e. off-line) is a highly controversial topic in current studies, especially for connectives for which a facilitating as well as an interfering role has been demonstrated. As a matter of fact, it seems that connectives facilitate the comprehension process in that they improve the reading process, but that they do not increase comprehension of the text. It might even be possible that they ease the reading task in such a way that they provide the reader with the "impression" of having understood the text instead of a real understanding. -- The objective of the experiment was to test this far reaching hypothesis for the use of connectives in expository texts. We wanted to determine the impact of causal connectives such as because ('parce que') and so ('donc') on comprehension and on the feeling of understanding, contrasting it with the impact of anaphoric expressions. Contrary to previous results, our experiment shows that the presence of connectives actually improved comprehension while it did not have an impact on the feeling of understanding."

   Abstract="Abstract  This article reports on an experiment investigating the impact of causal discourse markers (connectives and signaling phrases) on the comprehension of expository texts in L1 and L2. Although several psycholinguistic studies have investigated the impact of connectives and lexical markers of text structure on comprehension (i.e. off-line), there is no consensus on the exact effect of explicit discourse markers on text understanding; three different findings are reported in the literature: markers would have a facilitating effect, an interfering effect or no effect a tall. The first goal of this article is to clarify this problem of contradicting results by limiting the scope of the study to causal relations, and to one specific text type:expository texts. Furthermore, the naturalness of the experimental texts was controlled, readers did not need specific background knowledge to understand the texts and the experimental method consisted of open answer questioning. Our second goal is to investigate to what extent a supposed effect of linguistic marking depends on readers proficiency in a first or second language.The experiment consisted in the reading of short expository texts in two languages, Dutch and French, which both functioned as L1 and L2.The results indicate that readers benefit from the presence of causal relational markers both in L1 and in L2. Implications for (theories of) text processing are discussed, as well as for the further insights in reading comprehension in L1 and L2."

Our NLP group has recently created several systems for multidocument news summarization, but using purely statistical methods. Between these poles, there may be an unexplored avenue where knowledge of story structure can give partial, yet useful semantic understanding to a news reader. Such knowledge can then lead to summaries more informed than those based on solely statistical means. This student paper represents work in progress on a two-module system: The first module categorizes news articles into their underlying dramatic structures; the second will attempt to use this understanding to create and execute a generative plan, concisely retelling the story to form a surface-level summary."

Consequently, there is an increase in the demand for user aids such as summarising techniques. Against this background, the interdisciplinary Dagstuhl Seminar Summarising Text for Intelligent Communication, (Dec. 1993) outlined the academic state of the art with regard to summarising (abstracting) and proposed future directions for research and system development. Research is currently shifting its attention from text summarising to summarising states of affairs. Recycling solutions are put forward in order to satisfy short-term needs for summarisation products. In the medium and long term, it is necessary to devise concepts and methods of intelligent summarising which have a better formal and empirical grounding and a more modular organisation."

   Abstract="SimSum (Simulation of Summarizing) simulates 20 real-world working steps of expert summarizers. It presents an empirically founded cognitive model of summarizing and demonstrates that human summarization strategies can be simulated. The cognitive model operationalizes the discourse processing model developed by Kintsch and van Dijk. Knowledge engineering followed the KADS approach, empirical modeling used methods of grounded theory development. The observed strategies of expert summarizers have given rise to cooperating object-oriented agents communicating through dedicated blackboards. Each agent is implemented as a CLOS object with an assigned actor at the multimedia user interface. The interface is realized with Macromedia Director. Communication between CLOS and Macromedia Director is mediated by Apple Events. According to the first evaluation results in an educational environment, SimSum transmits summarization know-how effectively. It is, however, not designed as a tutorial system and serves active and curious users best. We are starting its expansion to summarizing in the WWW. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Nuclei and satellites are in constituency relations (nodes in a tree), but the dependency relationship is maintained (The notation is just like that used in syntax, where a PP can be sister to an N, but the PP acts as a modifier to the N). The model establishes a discourse grammar at the higher level of discourse (i.e., genres). Different genres, however, all make use of the same model of exchange, the systemic flowchart model. Patterns within the SFM have different probabilities, determined by the choice of genre. The paper provides a snapshot of the flowcharts used to model dialogue."

Instead, we propose a new type of repository, consisting of three large collections of (1) medically relevant word forms, structured along the lines of the existing Princeton WORDNET; (2) medically validated propositions, referred to here as medical facts, which will constitute what we shall call MEDICALFACTNET; and (3) propositions reflecting laypersons' medical beliefs, which will constitute what we shall call the MEDICALBELIEFNET. We introduce a methodology for setting up the MEDICALWORDNET. We then turn to the discussion of research challenges that have to be met to build this new type of information resource. We build a database of sentences relevant to the medical domain. The sentences are generated from WordNet via its relations as well as from medical statements broken down into elementary propositions. Two subcorpora of sentences are distinguished, MedicalBeliefNet and MedicalFactNet. The former is rated for assent by laypersons; the latter for correctness by medical experts. The sentence corpora will be valuable for a variety of applications in information retrieval as well as in research in linguistics and psychology with respect to the study of expert and non-expert beliefs and their linguistic expressions. Our work has to meet several considerable challenges. These include accounting for the distinction between medical experts and laypersons, the social issues of expert-layperson communication in different media, the linguistic aspects of encoding medical knowledge, and the reliability, volume, and emergence of medical knowledge. The work described here has been tested in a small pilot experiment [39] and awaits large-scale implementation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

   Abstract="This article discusses adverbial connectors first from a synchronic and then a diachronic perspective. The primary focus is on the various functions that such elements perform in different syntactic positions. These are dependent on (among other things) sentence type, due to the fact that adverbial connectors modalize the sentence they introduce. Adverbial connectors placed in the prefield following another constituent (Nacherstposition), for instance, mark a contrastive topic. An examination of German in earlier periods reveals that e.g. an adverb like allerdings appears in the prefield relatively recently. The function of contrastive topic marking was performed by adverbial connectors placed before other elements in the prefield (Vorerstposition). In contemporary German, this position serves to introduce or contrast utterances, which can contain different types of sentences."

   Title="Discourse Structure and Anaphora: Written and Conversational English",
   Publisher="Cambridge University Press",
   Address="Cambridge",
   Abstract="Chapter 3: Anaphora in conversational English. She identifies two modes of description: (1) the context-determines-use mode; (2) the use-accomplishes-context mode. She describes the basic pattern of anaphora: (1) the fist mention of a referent in a sequence is done with a full NP; (2) after the first mention of a referent, a pronoun is used to display an understanding of the sequence as not yet closed; (3) a full NP is used to display an understanding of the preceding sequence containing other mentions of the same referent as closed. Pronouns are used to display that a sequence is not closed: in the middle of an adjacency pair, in a turn expansion, beyond adjacency pairs: an adjacency pair can be tied to a preceding pair (series, post-elaboration, return pop).
Pronouns used to re-open a sequence: an instance of use-determines-context mode, in which the speaker accomplishes a reopening of the relevant sequence by using a pronominal form (40). Full NPs used to display that a sequence is understood as closed 
Anaphora in the environment of different gender referents: "the appearance of a different-gender referent does not alter the basic pattern of pronominalization established for the situation in which no "interfering" referents are mentioned." (48)
Anaphora in the environment of same gender referents: "the simple introduction of another referent does not necessarily produce ambiguity; it is the structural organization of the talk that determines what will count as interfering and what not." (48)
Full NPs used when other linguistic devices are not used: pronominalization is possible in the environment of same-gender referents if other linguistic devices besides the anaphor itself are used to guide the recipient to the intended referent. When other devices are not available or not used, full NPs will be used (58).
Non-structural factors in anaphora:	Disagreements, know + NP: overt recognitionals, assessments (negative), first mentions, demarcating a new unit,  replacing an action, using the same anaphoric devices, switching perspective."

   Volume=31,

   Pages="931-952",
   Abstract="This paper is an attempt to clarify the status of discourse markers. These lexical expressions have been studied under various labels, including discourse markers, discourse connectives, discourse operators, pragmatic connectives, sentence connectives, and cue phrases. Although most researchers agree that they are expressions which relate discourse segments, there is no agreement on how they are to be defined or how they function. After reviewing prior theoretical research, I define discourse markers as a class of lexical expressions drawn primarily from the syntactic classes of conjunctions, adverbs, and prepositional phrases. With certain exceptions, they signal a relationship between the interpretation of the segment they introduce, S2, and the prior segment, Si. They have a core meaning, which is procedural, not conceptual, and their more specific interpretation is 'negotiated' by the context, both linguistic and conceptual. There are two types: those that relate the explicit interpretation conveyed by S2 with some aspect associated with the segment, S1; and those that relate the topic of S2 to that of S1. I conclude by presenting what appears to be the major classes according to their function. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

   Abstract="The temporal dimension adds to databases the capability of functioning as repositories of narratives about the objects involved. Database narratives correspond both to sequences of past events and to simulated future events. This work addresses the problem of displaying such narratives in natural language. We focus here on the first kind of narrative, that is, we analyze a segment extracted from a log of the execution of pre-defined application-oriented operations, which is treated as a plot of the narrative in question. The main point in the presentation is that a three-level conceptual schema of the database provides a sound basis for interpreting such plots, although it should be complemented with further linguistic processing for the sake of fluency and conciseness. The schema-driven method for generating narratives from plots is described. A prototype Prolog implementation of the method is operational. A simple example is used to illustrate the discussion."

   Abstract="In order to be successful, speech acts that are intended to get the hearer to do something are often accompanied by supporting utterances aimed at making him/her understand their communicative purpose and, accept it as appropriate, as well as enabling him/her to perform the requested action. The purpose of this article is to determine the type of utterances that support recommendations in a corpus of popularizing medical texts published in two major Argentinean newspapers. The analysis shows that the most frequent supporting functions are those aimed at the acceptance of the communicative purpose. Also, supporting functions have been analyzed in terms of the speakers' acceptance of responsibility, i.e., we have considered whether supporting functions are (re)-formulated as a direct or indirect quotation of the information source or are formulated by the reporter. Findings show that a high percentage of supporting functions that justify recommendations are formulated as a direct quotation of the specialist's voice. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

   Abstract="A prototype taxonomic model will be applied to Aulus Gellius' Noctes Atticae, a miscellaneous work of the 2nd century, in order to analyze more effectively the specific features of a polymorphic text which is not adequately covered by traditional classifications. Gellius' relationship with his sources is in fact dynamic, based not on mimetic intentions but on a blend of different kinds of report and on different text parts, namely incipit, quotation, commentary, narration, and dialogue. The close relationship between text types and linguistic devices is investigated as a recursive feature, by focusing on discourse particles, which both indicate the interactional development and impose an internal textual hierarchy. Nam and sed perform a significant function in the commentaries and in several short chapters of Noctes Atticae, and in this function they cannot be replaced by other coniunctiones which belong to the same class in the normative Latin grammars (respectively, nam and enim to the causal, and at, autem, sed to the adversative). Discourse particles seem to reflect the nature of the text: while in the narrative structure discourse particles do not occur, in the incipit and quotations metatextual discourse particles prevail; in commentaries and dialogues interactional discourse particles signal both agreement and disagreement."

   Abstract="Coherence relations are typically taken to link two clauses or larger units and to be signaled at the text surface by conjunctions and certain adverbials. Relations, however, also can hold within clauses, indicated by prepositions like despite, due to, or in case of, when these have an internal argument denoting an eventuality. Although these prepositions act as reliable cues to indicate a specific relation, others are lexically more neutral. We investigated this situation for the German preposition bei, which turns out to be highly ambiguous. We demonstrate the range of readings in a corpus study, proposing 6 more specific prepositions as a comprehensive substitution set. All these uses of bei share a common kernel meaning, which is missed by the standard accounts that assume lexical polysemy. We examine the range of coherence relations that can be signaled by bei and provide some factors here supporting the disambiguation task in a framework of discourse interpretation."

   Abstract="Conflict situations do not only arise from misunderstandings, erroneous perceptions, partial, knowledge, false beliefs, etc., but also from differences in "opinions" and in the different agents' value systems. It is not always possible, and maybe not even desirable, to "solve" this kind of conflict, as the sources are subjective. The communicating agents can, however, use knowledge of the opponent's preferences, to try and convince the partner of a point of view which they wish to promote. To deal with these situations requires an argumentative capacity, able to handle not only "demonstrative" arguments but also "dialectic" ones, which may not necessarily be based on rationality and valid premises. This paper presents a formalization of a theory of informal argumentation, focused an techniques to change attitudes of the interlocutor, in the domain of health promotion. (C) 2000 Academic Press."

   Abstract="Various argumentation analysis tools permit the analyst to represent functional components of an argument (e.g., data, claim, warrant, backing), how arguments are composed of subarguments and defenses against potential counterarguments, and argumentation schemes. In order to facilitate a study of argument presentation in a biomedical corpus, we have developed a hybrid scheme that enables an analyst to encode argumentation analysis within the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which can be used to represent the discourse structure of a text. This paper describes the hybrid representation scheme and illustrates its use for investigation of contexts that license omission of elements of an argument. The analyses given in the paper involve reconstruction of enthymemes. Defeasible argumentation schemes serve as a constraint on reconstruction. In addition, the examples illustrate several other types of contextual constraints on reconstruction of enthymemes."

   Abstract="This paper presents an implemented computational model for interpreting and generating indirect answers to yes-no questions in English. Interpretation and generation are treated, respectively, as recognition of and construction of a responder's discourse plan for a full answer. An indirect answer is the result of the responder providing only part of the planned response, but intending for his discourse plan to be recognized by the questioner. Discourse plan construction and recognition make use of shared knowledge of discourse strategies, represented in the model by discourse plan operators. In the operators, coherence relations are used to characterize types of information that may accompany each type of answer. Recognizing a mutually plausible coherence relation obtaining between the actual response and a possible direct answer plays an important role in recognizing the responder's discourse plan. During generation, stimulus conditions model a speaker's motivation for selecting a satellite. Also during generation, the speaker uses his own interpretation capability to determine what parts of the plan are inferable by the hearer and thus do not need to be explicitly given. The model provides wider coverage than previous computational models for generating and interpreting indirect answers and extends the plan-based theory of implicature in several ways."

   Volume=12,

   Pages="249-270",
   Abstract="The design and assessment of safety critical systems often involves broad and distributed teams of designers, suppliers and analysts who represent diverse areas of expertise and motivations. Accurate and effective communication between these groups is therefore an issue of primary importance. The formalisation of specifications and arguments of safety can be of significant benefit in ensuring the consistency of evidence in such cases, when it must be presented across many domains. However, a formal description of a safety critical system may be unconvincing unless it is presented in a form which is (or forms which are) accessible to the broad range of users and assessors of safety cases. This raises issues of human communication which include the tailoring of information to particular communicative tasks; the efficacy of differing media for communication and the cognitive impact that such differing media have. This paper draws together work in fields of knowledge engineering, knowledge based systems and human communication in an effort to address, from a sound theoretical basis, these and other communication issues raised by the use of formal descriptions in safety critical systems. Further, this paper argues that a primary role for knowledge based systems techniques in safety critical systems is in supporting the communication of information."

   Abstract="We present an approach to mixed initiative dialogue in acoustic user interfaces to databases. First, we discuss how we distinguish between initiative and control in mixed initiative information retrieval dialogue and how the notions of taking, keeping, and relinquishing initiative and control are reflected in our approach. Based on this discussion, we develop a dialogue planning algorithm. This algorithm distinguished between resources and routines and between the type and the content of an utterance; type and content are calculated separately by routines that reason on the resources - a dialogue model, a dialogue history, and an application description. Through this division we achieve a dialogue where the system adapts to the user's attempts at changing the direction of a dialogue. Finally, we argue that automatic segmentation of the dialogue and automatic tracking of initiative and control is inherent to our approach."

   Pages="259-311",
   Abstract="People engage in task-oriented dialogues to carry out or plan a task. Each participant in such an interaction must be capable of processing plans in two ways. First, each participant must be capable of understanding the plans that the other participant is using. Researchers have developed theories and models about how computational systems should go about recognizing the plans and goals of another participant, both at the subject-matter level and at the level of the communication. This area of research is called plan recognition. Secondly, each participant must be able to make their owns plans to communicate. This area of natural language research is called text planning. Interactive systems -- systems that understand natural language and that can produce natural language to engage in a task-related interaction -- must address the issue of how understanding plans (the process of plan recognition) relates to making plans for the interaction (the process of text planning). We provide an introduction to these two research areas in natural language processing. Those who need to be familiar with both areas -- to conduct research at their intersection -- will find this introduction useful for building systems that both understand what people are trying to do when they speak and that can actively participate in the interaction."

   Pages="87–124",
   Abstract="In modelling the discourse–grammar interface, a central question concerns the status of discourse act as the minimal unit of discourse organization and its relation to units of grammatical structure. This paper seeks to clarify the notion of act by defining it as a strategic rather than a conceptual unit, and by setting out a classification of strategic acts. Illustration is then offered for the position that discourse acts are to a very considerable extent realized in English by intonation units and punctuation units. This is done by considering how punctuational variation and cases of intonation/syntax mismatch can be explained in terms of the specific discourse contribution of the units concerned. Although the correlation between discourse acts and intonation/punctuation units remains problematic, in that there may not be a 1:1 correspondence, it is still attractive — at least for English — to see the linguistic correlate of acts in intonation and punctuation units rather than in syntactic structures. The paper finishes by considering the implications for the formalizing of relations between discourse, semantics and syntax in Functional Discourse Grammar."

   Volume=2,

   Pages="261-268",
   Abstract="The main objective of the weight assignment is to provide ranking feature to an IR system. The retrieval performance of an IR system mainly depends on two parameters: extraction of a good set of keywords from text documents, and the use of a good weight assignment approach. Most of currently available weight assignment approaches do not suggest any change to the weights of keywords after their initial assignment. It means that these approaches are static.  
In this paper, we propose a dynamic weight assignment approach for weight assignment. We use Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) for indexing and retrieval purpose instead of keywords, and propose a dynamic weight assigned approach to the RST relationships. In our opinion, using this proposed approach can be helpful in improving the retrieval performance of an IR system. This approach can be used as part of any IR model after initial assignment of weights."

   Abstract="Relative clauses are usually differentiated according to their non-/restrictivity. Numerous theoretical studies look into questions such as how restrictive relative clauses can be distinguished from non-restrictive ones and to what extent the semantic-pragmatic differentiation between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is based on structural differences. The present article tackles a problem that has generally been neglected in previous research. It investigates from a syntactic perspective whether the class of non-restrictive relative clauses behaves homogeneously. Based on empirical evidence it argues that (i) appositive relative clauses must be distinguished syntactically from continuative relative clauses, and that (ii) continuative w- and d-relative clauses show a uniform syntactic behaviour. In view of these facts, a syntactic analysis is proposed which treats an appositive relative clause and its nominal antecedent as one constituent, and a continuative relative clause as a structurally orphaned syntagma."

   Journal="Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research",
   Volume=3,
   Pages="271-324",
   Abstract="This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called INSTRUCTO-SOAR that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. INSTRUCTO-SOAR meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks."

   Pages="295-329",
   Abstract="Numerous argumentation systems have been proposed in the literature. Yet there often appears to be a shortfall between proposed systems and possible applications. In other words, there seems to be a need for further development of proposals for argumentation systems before they can be used widely in decision-support or knowledge management. I believe that this shortfall can be bridged by taking a hybrid approach. Whilst formal foundations are vital, systems that incorporate some I of the practical ideas found in some of the informal approaches may make the,resulting hybrid systems more useful. In informal approaches, there is often an emphasis on using graphical notation with symbols that relate more closely to the real-world concepts to be modelled. There may also be the incorporation of an argument ontology oriented to the user domain. Furthermore, in informal approaches there can be greater consideration of how users interact with the models, such as allowing users to edit arguments and to weight influences on graphs representing arguments. In this paper, I discuss some of the features of argumentation, review some key formal argumentation systems, identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of these formal proposals and finally consider some ways to develop formal proposals to give hybrid argumentation systems. To focus my discussions, I will consider some applications, in particular an application in analysing structured news reports."

   Pages="191-223",
   Abstract="The term discourse analysis has been used interchangeably in two separate contexts spoken discourse (i.e., multiple-source dialogic) and written discourse (i.e., single-source monologic). Such a distinction, however, oversimplifies the situation; while there are obvious overlaps between the two, to some extent each has evolved in its own direction. Written discourse analysis, the subject of our discussion, is obviously closely connected with work in literacy, but it implicates a great heterogeneity of topics and approaches, including at least some from psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics. Discourse analysis, in the sense in which we are using it, emerged in the early 1970s. A modem history of written discourse analysis is perhaps best covered within a 40-50-year time span. In the course of that time, a number of new and emerging disciplines and research fields have contributed to systematic analyses of the linguistic features and patterns occurring in written texts. At the same time, other continuing disciplines have provided contributions that have been important and are ongoing. It should be fairly evident that any attempt to cover such a broad spectrum of views and disciplines would not be appropriate in a single article. We therefore intend to limit the scope of this paper to analyses of written discourse that explore the actual structuring of the text via some consistent framework. Our goal is to highlight and describe historically the various efforts to find the structures and linguistic patterns in texts that contribute to how they are understood, interpreted, and used. It seems to us that, in order to comprehend what has happened in the context of L2 writing research, it is necessary to understand the extensive work that has been done in discourse analysis.

   Abstract="Recent studies reveal that human tutoring sessions do not always end when the student has solved a problem. Instead, tutors and students frequently use a post-practice discussion to bring new topics to the table or to continue problem-solving discussions. One of the main roles of post-practice dialogues is to support transfer-that is, the student's ability to apply concepts and adapt familiar solution strategies to unfamiliar problems. Several developers of intelligent tutoring systems have implemented post-practice modules, with similar aims. However, in contrast to the integrated instructional planning that human tutors apparently perform, automated planning of reflective activities is typically done independently of instructional planning during problem solving. We present a framework for describing reflective plans that are distributed between problem solving and debrief and evidence that reflective discussions support transfer in elementary mechanics."

   Abstract="This article describes an implemented system which uses centering theory for planning of coherent
texts and choice of referring expressions. We argue that text and sentence planning need to be
driven in part by the goal of maintaining referential continuity and thereby facilitating pronoun
resolution: Obtaining a favorable ordering of clauses, and of arguments within clauses, is likely
to increase opportunities for nonambiguous pronoun use. Centering theory provides the basis for
such an integrated approach. Generating coherent texts according to centering theory is treated
as a constraint satisfaction problem. The well-known Rule 2 of centering theory is reformulated in
terms of a set of constraints—cohesion, salience, cheapness, and continuity—and we show sample
outputs obtained under a particular weighting of these constraints. This framework facilitates
detailed research into evaluation metrics and will therefore provide a productive research tool in
addition to the immediate practical benefit of improving the fluency and readability of generated
texts. The technique is generally applicable to natural language generation systems, which perform
hierarchical text structuring based on a theory of coherence relations with certain additional
assumptions."

   Abstract="Question-answering (QA) systems have proven to be helpful, especially to those who feel uncomfortable entering keywords, sometimes extended with search symbols such as +, *, and so forth. In developing such systems, the main focus has been on the enhanced retrieval performance of searches, and recent trends in QA systems center on the extraction of exact answers. However, when their usability was evaluated, some users indicated that they found it difficult to accept the answers because of the absence of supporting context and rationale. Current approaches to address this problem include providing answers with linking paragraphs or with summarizing extensions. Both methods are believed to be sufficient to answer questions seeking the names of objects or quantities that have only a single answer, However, neither method addresses the situation when an answer requires the comparison and integration of information appearing in multiple documents or in several places in a single document. This paper argues that coherent answer generation is crucial for such questions, and that the key to this coherence is to analyze texts to a level beyond sentence annotations. To demonstrate this idea, a prototype has been developed based on rhetorical structure theory, and a preliminary evaluation has been carried out. The evaluation indicates that users prefer to see the extended answers that can be generated using such semantic annotations, provided that additional context and rationale information are made available."

An on-going comparison of biological and biomedical journal articles with their author-written abstracts is providing a basis for a more linguistically detailed model of abstract derivation using syntactic representations of selected source sentences. The description makes use of rich dictionary information to formulate paraphrasing rules of differing degrees of generality, including some which are sublanguage-specific, and others which appear valid in several languages when formulated using "lexical functions" to express important semantic relationships between lexical items. Some paraphrase operations may use both lexical functions and rhetorical relations between sentences to reformulate larger chunks of text in a concise abstract sentence.

   Abstract="We present an analysis of dialogues produced in an experimental study on collaborative learning. In the study, tenth graders were first taught either qualitative or quantitative knowledge of classical mechanics. Afterwards, dyads of students who had been taught different knowledge collaboratively worked on problems which were beyond the competence of each student, Qualitatively instructed students gained significantly more from the information provided by their quantitatively instructed partners than the other way round. Analyses of the dialogues produced by the students revealed that successfully learning dyads were characterised by coherent dialogue structures and that students who learned most during the collaboration frequently assumed the role of a reflector.

   Journal="NeuroImage",
   Volume=33,
   Number=1,
   Pages="343-361",
   Abstract="To build up coherence between sentences (comprehend discourse), we must draw inferences, i.e. activate and integrate information that is not actually stated. We used event-related fMRI to determine the localization and extent of brain activity mediating causal inferencing across short, three-sentence scenarios. Participants read and made causal coherence judgments to sentences that were highly causally related, intermediately related or unrelated to their preceding two-sentence contexts. The highly related and intermediately related scenarios were matched in terms of semantic similarities between their individual component words. A pre-rating study established that causal inferences were generated to the intermediately related but not to the highly related or unrelated scenarios. In the scanner, sentences that were intermediately related (relative to highly related or unrelated) to their preceding contexts were associated with longer judgment reaction times and sustained increases in hemodynamic activity within left lateral temporal/inferior parietal/prefrontal cortices, the right inferior prefrontal gyrus and bilateral superior medial prefrontal cortices. In contrast, sentences that were unrelated (relative to highly related) to their preceding contexts were associated with only transient increases in activity (at, but not after, the peak of the hemodynamic response) within the right lateral temporal cortex and the right inferior prefrontal gyrus. These data suggest that, to make sense of discourse, we activate a large bilateral cortical network in response to what is not explicitly stated. We suggest that this network reflects the activation, retrieval and integration of information from long-term semantic memory into incoming discourse structure during causal inferencing."

   Abstract="Despite the central role of the media in contemporary society, studies examining the rhetorical practices of journalists are rare in organization and management research. We know little of the textual micro strategies and techniques through which journalists convey specific messages to their readers. Partially to fill the gap, this paper outlines a methodological framework that combines three perspectives of text analysis and interpretation: critical discourse analysis, systemic functional grammar and rhetorical structure theory. Using this framework, we engage in a close reading of a single media text (a press article) on a recent case of industrial restructuring in the financial services. In our empirical analysis, we focus on key arguments put forward by the journalists' rhetorical constructions. We maintain that these arguments-which are not frame-breaking but rather tend to confirm existing presuppositions held by the audience-are an essential part of the legitimization and naturalization of specific management ideas and ideologies."

In this research, the authors explored advance organizers from a business perspective, where larger documents are read under time pressure. Graphic and verbal advance organizers were manipulated into six versions of an advisory report, read by 159 experienced professional readers in a between-subjects design. Their reading time was limited to encourage selective reading. The results show that graphic advance organizers facilitate selective reading, but they do not enhance recall. Verbal advance organizers introducing a problem enhance recall, and graphic advance organizers moderate the effects on both selective reading and recall."

   Abstract="In this study of temporal framing, we examine the interaction between "indexing" via temporal discourse frames and another mode of discourse organisation: connection via discourse relations. This interaction is shown to be problematic in the case of the Narration relation, as Narration implies a temporal progression which conflicts with the static nature of temporal frames, often making it difficult to determine the scope of a frame introducing expression. We suggest that two separate dimensions ought to be taken into account in the framing hypothesis: the ideational dimension (whereby the frame introducer plays an indexing role in the strict sense) and the textual dimension (whereby the introducer is characterised by its ability to delimit a text segment). We show that in contact with the Narration relation, temporal framing loses its ideational dimension, but maintains its role in discourse organisation (textual dimension). We also suggest that this dual nature of framing should be studied through the interaction between temporal frames and other discourse relations such as Commentary or Background. Our approach to these questions relies mostly on corpus analysis, but also uses made-up examples."

In the domain of international matters, the public relies heavily on the media, and editorials play an even greater role. This article examines how explicit mentions of external sources of information function in the argumentative structure of editorials to achieve a persuasive effect. A corpus of 40 editorials dealing with Russia (taken from Le Monde and The New York Times between August 1999 and March 2000) has been studied using a cognitive-based linguistic model of discourse analysis. It is shown how under the guise of bringing some objectivity to the editorials' argumentation, external sources of information facilitate and enhance their subjectivity."

systems have traditionally exploited the structuring role of textual discourse markers
such as relational and referential phrases. These coherence markers of the
traditional notion of text, however, do not work in non-linear documents: a new set
of graphical devices is needed together with formation rules to govern their usage,
supported by sound theoretical frameworks. If in linear documents graphical

   Number=11,
   Pages="1154-1171",
   Abstract="This paper examines the representational requirements for interactive, collaborative systems intended to support sensemaking and argumentation over contested issues. We argue that a perspective supported by semiotic and cognitively oriented discourse analyses offers both theoretical insights and motivates representational requirements for the semantics of tools for contesting meaning. We introduce our semiotic approach, highlighting its implications for discourse representation, before describing a research system (ClaiMaker) designed to support the construction of scholarly argumentation by allowing analysts to publish and contest 'claims' about scientific contributions. We show how ClaiMaker's representational scheme is grounded in specific assumptions concerning the nature of explicit modelling, and the evolution of meaning within a discourse community. These characteristics allow the system to represent scholarly discourse as a dynamic process, in the form of continuously evolving structures. A cognitively oriented discourse analysis then shows how the use of a small set of cognitive relational primitives in the underlying ontology opens possibilities for offering users advanced forms of computational service for analysing collectively constructed argumentation networks.

Another: A comparative study of the work of 10 researchers & research teams in the field of relations among discourse units in written texts focuses on a set of relations broadly described as contrastive. Three theoretical orientations are distinguished, based on selection from three groups of assumptions, which are modeled as concentric circles yielding, in outward order, semantic, speech-act, & social-act orientations. Emphasis is placed on a description of three relations of rhetorical structure theory: antithesis, concession, & neutral contrast. Whereas antithesis & concession involve a nucleus & satellite, neutral contrast is multinuclear, consisting of two nuclear spans, neither of which is central. It is shown that concession, considered elsewhere to be contrastive, does not express contrast. 33 References. J. Hitchcock",

   Title="{Talking about Language: The Rhetoric of Language Columns}",
   School="University of Helsinki",
   Note="Available from UMI, Ann Arbor, MI. Order No. C813682."
   Type="PhD dissertation",
   Abstract="The study focuses on the genre of language columns and the ways Finnish language professionals talk about language. From the perspective of the analysis, one needs to take into consideration the context and discourse practices of a genre when defining the genre of a text. The material of the study consists of 204 language columns in Finnish newspapers. Methodologically the study is based on genre analysis and the techniques of the New Rhetoric. It also applies Rhetorical Structure Theory and metaphor theory. The study demonstrates that in the analysis of genre, the socio-cultural and historical contexts are fundamental. The following aspects pertaining to the development of modern Standard Finnish are apparently vital: national values, language planning and major dictionary projects. Furthermore, the rhetorical analysis shows that the authorities used in the columns are classical and established authors and works, whereas contemporary research is marginally represented. In the analysis of schematic structures one finds two prototypical schemes used in the columns: (1) the problem-solution scheme, and (2) the general-example scheme. These schemes are already suggested by the way a text begins, and they also have different functions. The problem-solution scheme begins with an interrogative or a discourse representation allowing for the discussion of normative issues. The general example scheme begins either with a relational process or a statement, and the typical topics discussed are individual words or particular phenomena. The analysis of metaphors shows that language is conceptualised through metaphors, which can be divided into two semes (minimal units of signification) related either to nature or to culture. Nature metaphors are used to describe language change in which people can, however, have a guiding role. Culture metaphors, then, are related to the societal and contractual aspects of language. The characteristic type of argument of the language columns is the empirical argument, realised through the use of examples and verbs of perception and emotion. These can be used both for reasoning and for evaluation. Negative evaluations especially are expressed through impressions of strangeness."

The rhetorical parser is discussed in detail once again, starting from the corpus study of discourse markers (which is actually discussed in more detail here than in previous papers), all the way through to weighted trees and applications for text summarisation. The shift-reduce algorithm as presented here is also more involved, looking similar to the Japanese version of (Marcu Carlson Watanabe 2000). It emerges that paragraph boundaries are counted as discourse markers in the corpus. Also making a first appearance is the notion of matching similar words as a means of determining the relatedness of spans.
This paper also touches on several other discourse approach."

   Pages="90-169",
   Abstract="Spoken dialogue systems allow users to interact with computer-based applications such as databases and expert systems by using natural spoken language. The origins of spoken dialogue systems can be traced back to Artificial Intelligence research in the 1950s concerned with developing conversational interfaces. However, it is only within the last decade or so, with major advances in speech technology, that large-scale working systems have been developed and, in some cases, introduced into commercial environments. As a result many major telecommunications and software companies have become aware of the potential for spoken dialogue technology to provide solutions in newly developing areas such as computer-telephony integration. Voice portals, which provide a speech-based interface between a telephone user and Web-based services, are the most recent application of spoken dialogue technology. This article describes the main components of the technology-speech recognition, language understanding, dialogue management, communication with an external source such as a database, language generation, speech synthesis-and shows how these component technologies can be integrated into a spoken dialogue system. The article describes in detail the methods that have been adopted in some well-known dialogue systems, explores different system architectures, considers issues of specification, design, and evaluation, reviews some currently available dialogue development toolkits, and outlines prospects for future development."

   Volume=8,

   Pages="924-943",
   Abstract="On the background of rising Intranet applications the automatic generation of adaptable, context-sensitive hypertexts becomes more and more important [El-Beltagy et al., 2001]. This observation contradicts the literature on hypertext authoring, where Information Retrieval techniques prevail, which disregard any linguistic and context-theoretical underpinning. As a consequence, resulting hypertexts do not manifest those schematic structures, which are constitutive for the emergence of text types and the context-mediated understanding of their instances, i.e. natural language texts. This paper utilizes Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and its context model as a theoretical basis of hypertext authoring. So called Systemic Functional Hypertexts (SFHT) are proposed, which refer to a stratified context layer as the proper source of text linkage. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, hypertexts are reconstructed from a linguistic point of view as a kind of supersign, whose constituents are natural language texts and whose structuring is due to intra- and intertextual coherence relations and their context-sensitive interpretation. Second, the paper prepares a formal notion of SFHTs as a first step towards operationalization of fundamental text linguistic concepts. On this background, SFHTs serve to overcome the theoretical poverty of many approaches to link generation."

   Abstract="In the field of biomedicine, an overwhelming amount of experimental data has become available as a result of the high throughput of research in this domain. The amount of results reported has now grown beyond the limits of what can be managed by manual means. This makes it increasingly difficult for the researchers in this area to keep up with the latest developments. Information extraction (IE) in the biological domain aims to provide an effective automatic means to dynamically manage the information contained in archived journal articles and abstract collections and thus help researchers in their work. However, white considerable advances have been made in certain areas of IE, pinpointing and organizing factual information (such as experimental results) remains a challenge. In this paper we propose tackling this task by incorporating into IE information about rhetorical zones, i.e. classification of spans of text in terms of argumentation and intellectual attribution. As the first step towards this goat, we introduce a scheme for annotating biological texts for rhetorical zones and provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data annotated according to this scheme. We also discuss our preliminary research on automatic zone analysis, and its incorporation into our IE framework. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

   Volume=45,
   Number=1,
   Pages="24-51",
   Abstract="An evidential causal relation like, "Because most distinguished students got bad grades, the teacher made some mistakes in evaluating his students' papers," is more difficult to process than a factual one like, "Because he got tired after a long semester, the teacher made some mistakes in evaluating his students' papers" (Noordman & de Blijzer, 2000; Traxler, Sanford, Aked, & Moxey, 1997). Two experiments explored the distinguishing characteristics of different types of causal relations. Experiment I introduced a third type of causal relation-a deductive causal relation-such as, "Because grading a paper is a subjective process, the teacher made some mistakes in evaluating his students' papers." Deductive causal relations are intermediate in difficulty between factual and evidential causal relations but behave in important ways like evidential relations. Experiment 2 found that using psychological verbs (e.g., like) to express evidential relations makes causal statements that express these relations more acceptable than their counterparts expressed using action verbs (e.g., destroy). The article concludes with a discussion of the main characteristics of different types of causal statements. It is argued that understanding the speaker's theory of mind is the basis for comprehending evidential and deductive causal relations. Finally, this article proposes a tentative framework for analyzing the comprehension of causal relations."

   Abstract="This paper describes a knowledge-based approach for summarizing and presenting the behavior of hydrologic networks. This approach has been designed for visualizing data from sensors and simulations in the context of emergencies caused by floods. It follows a solution for event summarization that exploits physical properties of the dynamic system to automatically generate summaries of relevant data. The summarized information is presented using different modes such as text, 2D graphics and 3D animations on virtual terrains. The presentation is automatically generated using a hierarchical planner with abstract presentation fragments corresponding to discourse patterns, taking into account the characteristics of the user who receives the information and constraints imposed by the communication devices (mobile phone, computer, fax, etc.). An application following this approach has been developed for a national hydrologic information infrastructure of Spain."

   Volume=29,
   Number=7,
   Pages="75-&",
   Abstract="Automatic text generators are at the heart of systems that provide users with information. The trick is getting the system to answer follow-up questions as naturally as possible. But even in moderately complex domains, the task of handcrafting explanations using ''canned'' text or templates is so time-consuming and error-prone that it becomes infeasible. Furthermore, these techniques cannot be extended to let a system consider the user's prior knowledge, past problem-solving experiences, or the preceding dialogue. To overcome these limitations, researchers have focused on automatically synthesizing text directly from underlying knowledge bases. Automatic text-generation systems pose new opportunities-and new problems. Studies of human-human interactions show that people often follow up requests for information with more questions. This observation also underscores the need for computer-based information systems to let users ask follow-up questions. This capability is especially crucial in patient education, for example, where misunderstandings could have serious consequences. The ability to handle follow-up requests in context is essential, even crucial, to applications like the patient education system described in this article. The direction we've taken presents one alternative to full-fledged natural language-understanding and makes it possible to design systems by adopting a pragmatic (and possibly more useful) approach of generating choices for the user. Our initial system evaluations reveal that users are comfortable with the interface as a way to ask follow-up questions."

   Abstract="Practical problems of multimedia document production require software engineers to provide an effective framework for inter-professional work. This paper distinguishes between abstract and physical media and hence provides the basis for definitions of multiple media and multimedia and the context for reviewing content structures proven in other disciplines. Such structures can act as a guide for production and the notion of the navigable discourse structure provides the essential means for testing content design. Combining these structures in a discourse driven process model and production method facilitates both the design of content and the development of associated software in an ordered and integrated manner, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ad hoc approaches. Investigation and testing of these concepts was effected via two case studies involving the production of two multimedia demonstrations of software engineering tools."

Subsequent recall of one sentence cued by the other improved, and then deteriorated as the causal relatedness of the two sentences increased. The present experiments extended this work and replicated the basic finding of a quadratic relation between recall and causal relatedness. Several explanations are considered to account for these results. The long reading times together with relatively poor recall at low levels of causal relatedness argue against a pure processing effort model. Variations in the integration and elaboration of the representation of the sentence pairs would seem to better account for the relation of recall and causal relatedness. Several issues raised by this explanation are then briefly considered."

   Abstract="Animated characters that move and gesticulate appropriately with spoken text are useful in a wide range of applications. Unfortunately, this class of movement is very difficult to generate, even more so when a unique, individual movement style is required. We present a system that, with a focus on arm gestures, is capable of producing full-body gesture animation for given input text in the style of a particular performer. Our process starts with video of a person whose gesturing style we wish to animate. A tool-assisted annotation process is performed on the video, from which a statistical model of the person's particular gesturing style is built. Using this model and input text tagged with theme, rheme and focus, our generation algorithm creates a gesture script. As opposed to isolated singleton gestures, our gesture script specifies a stream of continuous gestures coordinated with speech. This script is passed to an animation system, which enhances the gesture description with additional detail. It then generates either kinematic or physically simulated motion based on this description. The system is capable of generating gesture animations for novel text that are consistent with a given performer's style, as was successfully validated in an empirical user study."

   Abstract="The paper concerns complex syntax in the sense of text-embedded clause-combining. We consider different perspectives on why languages employ complex syntax, taking the usage-based view that “discourse drives grammar”. Complex syntax is analyzed as shedding light on the nature of “contrastive rhetoric”, on the assumption that linguistic typology interacts with rhetorical strategies in the construction of discourse. An innovative methodology is delineated for evaluating syntactic complexity along a hierarchy of clause-combining relations, from isotactic single clauses to paratactic symmetric and asymmetric stringing by coordination and complementation, on to hypotactic layering by adverbials and relative clauses, and endotactic nesting or embedding of one clause inside another. Detailed criteria for each of these levels of clause-combining were applied to 64 narrative texts written by graduate-level university students, native speakers of four different languages (English, French, Hebrew, and Spanish) on the shared topic of interpersonal conflict. The discourse effects of linguistic typology are analyzed in terms of the linguistic means available to these different languages for combining clauses as well as discursive strategies preferred by speaker–writers in constructing narratives."

It is demonstrated that the reader's knowledge of the world is an important factor in controlling inferences. A number of experiments are discussed in which the role of the reader's knowledge with respect to the information to be inferred is investigated by varying the materials in terms of their familiarity to the reader, and by having readers with high and low knowledge with respect to the content domain of the text."

   Abstract="Moser and Moore (1995, to appear) carried out a corpus study of discourse cues in tutorial dialogue. Their annotation uses Relational Discourse Analysis (RDA), which distinguishes core elements (nuclei-like) from contributors (satellite-like). In their discussion of these results, Moser and Moore propose that clauses in the contributor-core order are harder to understand than clauses in core-contributor order, but do not attempt to explain why the "hard" order is ever used. Here, we recruit evidence from work by Stevenson and her collaborators, which substantiates the empirical claim. We then suggest that by distinguishing information structure (given-new) from intentional structure (core-contributor), we can explain why hard orders are surprisingly frequent. We not, however, that this cannot be the whole story, and show how the hierarchical RDA structure helps account for differences between discourse cues such as since, so, this means, and therefore."

   Abstract="Multi-document summarization is a challenge to information overload problem to provide a condensed text for a number of documents. Most multi-document summarization systems make use of extraction techniques (e.g., important sentence extraction) and compile a summary from the selected information. However, sentences gathered from multiple sources are not organized as a comprehensible text. Therefore, it is important to consider sentence ordering of extracted sentences in order to reconstruct discourse structure in a summary. We propose a novel method to plan a coherent arrangement of sentences extracted from multiple newspaper articles. Results of our experiment show that sentence reordering has a discernible effect on summary readability. The results also shows significant improvement on sentence arrangement compared to former methods."

   Abstract="Purpose - The purpose of this research is to develop a method for automatic construction of multi-document summaries of sets of news articles that might be retrieved by a web search engine in response to a user query. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the cross-document discourse analysis. an event-based framework is proposed for integrating and organizing information extracted from different news articles. It has a hierarchical structure in which the summarized information is presented at the top level and more detailed information given at the lower levels. A tree-view interface was implemented for displaying a multi-document summary based on the framework. A preliminary user evaluation was performed by comparing the framework-based summaries against the sentence-based summaries. Findings - In a small evaluation. all the human subjects preferred the framework-based summaries to the sentence-based summaries. It indicates that the event-based framework is ail effective way to summarize a set of news articles reporting an event or a series of relevant events. Research limitations/implications - Limited to event-based news articles only, not applicable to news critiques and other kinds of news articles. A summarization system based on the event-based framework is being implemented. Originality/value - An event-based framework for summarizing sets of news articles was developed and evaluated using a tree-view interface for displaying Such summaries."

   Pages="177-204",
   Abstract="Provides a corpus study of the distribution of seven Dutch negative connectives over relational classes, leading to a proposed revision to the relational classification proposed by Sanders etal earlier in the decade. ABSTRACT FROM SOURCE: This article proposes to revise the Sanders et al. (1992, 1993) classification of negative coherence relations on the basis of a comparative, corpus-based analysis of seven Dutch connectives. First, some conceptual problems in the Sanders et al. classification are discussed, with special attention for the 'polarity' parameter that distinguishes between 'positive' and
'negative' relations: Subsequently, a methodological section reviews different kinds of evidence for relation classifications. It is argued that the behavior of linguistic devices for the expression of coherence relations constitutes a crucial source of evidence and it is proposed to use a Discriminating Connective Principle when assessing this linguistic evidence. By means of a corpus study, it is shown that several refinements of the Sanders et al. classification are conceivable. In the revised framework, comparative relations take the place of additive relations, direct and indirect comparisons are distinguished and epistemic negative relations are further differentiated on the basis of the configuration of perspectives in the successive discourse segments. The linguistic support for the revised classification, as provided 
by the distribution of seven Dutch negative connectives over the relational classes, is shown to be satisfactory."

   Journal="Cognitive Linguistics",
   Volume=10,

   Pages="147-184",
   Abstract="it is commonly assumed that comparative coherence relations (e.g., Peter is tall but his brother is short) can be analyzed in terms of semantic contrast. In this article it is claimed that comparative relations need to be understood in a context containing a similarity assumption. This assumption may be confirmed (positive polarity) or denied (negative polarity) by the comparative text passage. When two entities are characterized in terms of a common variable without a similarity assumption being present (e.g., Peter's favorite color is red. His brother prefers green), the coherence relation is merely additive. Additive relations are not defined for polarity. While comparative relations may be linguistically marked by connectives like 'but', 'by contrast', or 'and' in English or 'maar', daarentegen', or 'en' in Dutch, additive relations remain unmarked. The distinction between comparative and additive relations is empirically supported by a corpus-based study of the linguistic marking of similarities and differences between the price movements of shares, using 400 fragments from stock-market reports in a Dutch daily newspaper. Some of these fragments clearly invoke similarity assumptions, for instance because of the fact that two companies are in the same branch of industry or because the fragment is preceded by an announcement of the general trend in share prices on a particular day. It was found that the overwhelming majority of linguistic markers of similarities and differences in share price movements occurred in contexts containing similarity assumptions. For instance, similarities that were to be expected may be marked by 'en', 'and' (e.g. Elsevier gained 1.10 [new price 67.80} [Daarentegen] Kluwer lost forty cents (new price 50.70)). Some apparent counterexamples, in which two companies from he same branch of industry show different share price movements while this difference remains unmarked, in fact do not invalidate the similarity assumption framework but support it. In the majority of these cases the similarity assumption has been eliminated or weakened by earlier announcements of difference within a certain branch. A closer analysis of five Dutch comparative connectives reveals that two dimensions of comparative polarity need to be distinguished: a propositional polarity parameter with the values 'difference' and 'similarity', and an assumptional polarity parameter distinguishing between confirmations and denials of the relevant assumption. Different linguistic elements may be characterize in terms of different polarity dimensions. For instance, 'ook', 'also', expresses positive propositional polarity, while 'maar', 'but', is an indication of negative assumptional polarity."

   Abstract="The linguistic categories apparent in people's everyday language use provide us with interesting insights into the working of the mind. In this article we study the way in which Dutch speakers categorize causally related events by expressing them with the connectives dus `so' or daarom `that's why'. These two connectives both express volitional and epistemic causal coherence relations. Their overlapping contexts of use raise the question of why two separate, highly grammaticalized linguistic items exist to express similar relationships. We propose an analysis of these connectives, clarifying their similarities and di.erences, in terms of subjectivity: the amount of speaker involvement. Empirical support for this analysis is presented from corpus studies and experiments in which language users were asked to state their preference for one of the connectives in contexts displaying different degrees of subjectivity."

It includes the users' characteristics, their current domain of application, the tasks they commonly perform and the device they are currently using. This context is also evolving. When one information need is satisfied, another is likely to emerge. An information access system must, therefore, be able to track this dynamic and evolving context, and exploit it to retrieve actionable information from appropriate sources and deliver it in a form suitable for the current situation. This paper presents a generic architecture that supports the construction of information retrieval and delivery systems that make use of context. The architecture, called Myriad, includes an adaptive virtual document planner, and explicit, dynamic representations of the user's current context."

   Abstract="The need to model the relation between discourse structure and linguistic features of utterances is almost universally acknowledged in the literature on discourse. However, there is only weak consensus on what the units of discourse structure are, or the criteria for recognizing and generating them. We present quantitative results of a two-part study using a corpus of spontaneous, narrative monologues. The first part of our paper presents a method for empirically validating multiutterance units referred to as discourse segments. We report highly significant results of segmentations performed by naive subjects, where a commonsense notion of speaker intention is the segmentation criterion. In the second part of our study, data abstracted from the subjects' segmentations serve as a target for evaluating two sets of algorithms that use utterance features to perform segmentation. On the first algorithm set, we evaluate and compare the correlation of discourse segmentation with three types of linguistic cues (referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses). We then develop a second set using two methods: error analysis and machine learning. Testing the new algorithms on a new data set shows that when multiple sources of linguistic knowledge are used concurrently, algorithm performance improves."

   Abstract="Though everyday interaction is predominantly multimodal, a purpose-developed framework for describing the semantic interplay between verbal and non-verbal communication is still lacking. This lack not only indicates one's poor understanding of multimodal human behaviour, but also weakens any attempt to model such behaviour computationally. In this article, we present COSMOROE, a corpus-based framework for describing semantic interrelations between images, language and body movements. We argue that in viewing such relations from a message-formation perspective rather than a communicative goal one, one may develop a framework with descriptive power and computational applicability. We test COSMOROE for compliance to these criteria, by using it for annotating a corpus of TV travel programmes; we present all particulars of the annotation process and conclude with a discussion on the usability and scope of such annotated corpora."

   Journal="Discourse Processes",
   Volume=23,
   Number=3,
   Pages="337-355",
   Abstract="Three mini-essays review the progress made on two traditional problems and one newer problem in discourse understanding. The first traditional problem is the relationship between individual sentences and discourses. The role of discourse factors on sentence comprehension has received continuing attention, whereas the complementary question of sentences' contribution to discourse comprehension has been neglected. Recent work may have redressed this neglect to some extent. The second traditional topic is individual differences in discourse comprehension; the conclusion is that there has been substantial refinement of earlier hypotheses about the basic word and functional memory sources of such differences, whereas research on higher level causal factors remains inconclusive. The newer third problem, the representation of multiple texts, exposes fresh views of problems of discourse, especially the contrast between situation and text models. A recent representational Documents Model is briefly described. The conclusion suggests some unifying threads among these three problems."

   Journal="Computational Linguistics",
   Volume=26,
   Number=2,
   Pages="139-193",
   Abstract="An important aspect of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the ability to identify when the same object in the world is the referent of symbols in different modalities. To understand the caption of a picture, for instance, one needs to identify the graphical symbols that are referred to by names and pronouns in the natural language text. One way to think of this problem is in terms oft he notion of anaphora; however, unlike linguistic anaphoric inference, in which antecedents for pronouns are selected from a linguistic context, in the interpretation of the textual part of multimodal messages the antecedents ave selected from a graphical context. Under this view, resolving multimodal references is like resolving anaphora across modalities. Another way to see the same problem is to look at pronouns in texts about drawings as deictic. In this second view, the context of interpretation of a natural language term is defined asa set of expressions of a graphical language with well-defined syntax and semantics. Natural language and graphical terms are thought of as standing in a relation of translation similar to the translation relation that holds between natural languages. In this paper a theory based on this second view is presented. In this theory, the relations between multimodal representation and spatial deixis, on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and deictic inference, on the other, are discussed. An integrated model of anaphoric and deictic resolution in the context of the interpretation of multimodal discourse is also advanced."

   School="Nova Southeastern University",
   Note="Citation of: book, Text Technology paper, Mann & Taboada (both), web site",
   Type="Ph.D. dissertation",
   Abstract="Numerous studies have affirmed the value of asynchronous online communication as a learning resource. Several investigations, however, have indicated that discussions in asynchronous environments are often neither interactive nor coherent. This research sought to develop an enhanced understanding of interactional coherence in asynchronous learning environments. The study used Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to analyze and assess the coherence of a several asynchronous discussions. The analysis revealed that the discussions were structurally dynamic. While RST structures resulting from static documents are acyclic tree-shaped structures, the rhetorical networks representing asynchronous threads are frequently cyclic. Thus, the analysis required a modified form of RST based on reduced constraints and restricted schemas. By this means, it was possible to create structural models of the discussions. These models were used to investigate asynchronous argumentation and topic drift and to perform a comparative analysis of multiple discussions. The investigation found argumentation was more prevalent in some groups than others. In one group the analysis indicated the dominant mode of interaction was disagreement; in another group, argumentation was generally constructive; and in a third group, argumentation tended to be supportive and concessive. The investigation found that topic drift does not occur as a matter of chance. Participants use topic drift in order to adapt discussion to a topic of preference. As such, topics do not drift so much as they are pushed and pulled. A consequence of this process is that threads often begin with a strong research-based opening message, but descend to anecdotes and personal commentary. The conferencing systems used for the discussions were similar in their features, but the discussions differed, particularly in their use of threading. In one group, less than half of the messages were threaded, with the remainder posted as singletons. In other groups most of the messages were in threads. This research provides a framework and a terminology for fine-grained analysis of interactional coherence. By showing the applicability of RST to asynchronous discussion, the study has offered evidence that assessment technology could be developed for online discussions. In addition, the development of rhetorical networks as a directed graph theory for representing the semantics of asynchronous interaction could lead to new knowledge representation technologies for multi-agent collaboration systems."

   Abstract="This study describes a discourse approach to explanation aware knowledge representation. It presents a reasoning model that adheres to argumentation as found in written discourse, intended for use in intelligent human-computer collaboration and inter-agent deliberation. The approach integrates the Toulmin model with Rhetorical Structure Theory and Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's (1958) strategic forms of argumentative processes to define a set of constraints for governing argumentative interactions and formulating explanations in an ontologically normalized manner. Arguments, when satisfied, are instantiated into a dynamic rhetorical network that represents the system's model of the situation. Two modalities of instantiation are proposed. Inferential instantiation is used when a claim may be inferred from a ground, and synthetic instantiation is used for descriptive argumentation where both ground and claim must be satisfied for the argument to be instantiated. The instantiation process maps arguments into the network using interaction links. Defined interactions include accrual, concomitance, backing, substantiation, dissociation, rebuttal, undercut, and confusion. It is envisioned that communities of agents endowed with reasoning capabilities would engage in collaborative explanatory argumentation, using these interactions as mechanisms for detecting and managing conflict and agreement."

Several investigations, however, have indicated that discussions in asynchronous environments are often neither interactive nor coherent. The research reported sought to develop an enhanced understanding of interactional coherence, argumentation, and topic drift in asynchronous learning environments. Rhetorical structure theory (RST) was used to analyze and assess the coherence of several asynchronous discussions. Findings include that asynchronous discussions take the form of dynamic rhetorical structures which are continuously redefined as new messages are added to a thread, that argumentation may be more prevalent in some discussions than others, that topic drift does not seem to occur as a matter of chance, but rather topics are manipulated to suit the individual preferences of the participants, and that the use of threading differs considerably from one discussion group to another. By demonstrating the applicability of RST, argumentative analysis, and topic drift analysis to asynchronous discussion, this research provides a framework and a terminology for fine-grained analysis of interactional coherence.

   Abstract="We have developed a collaborative, reuse hypertext system that has novel browsing and retrieval characteristics. The system, called Many Using and Creating Hypertext (MUCH), has been implemented on a network of UNIX workstations and used extensively in our group. This paper presents the model underlying the use of the MUCH system with respect to organizing, retrieving, and reorganizing information. In order to reuse information successfully, one must first organize it, then retrieve it, and finally reorganize it. The storage layer of hypermedia is logically based on nodes and links, and the MUCH system assumes that the names for these nodes and links represent a kind of semantic net. Documents, thesauri, and discussions may all be connected in this semantic net. The various functionalities of the system then exploit the knowledge in this semantic net. Traversals of the net with various filters are the basis for the views that users get of the semantic net. The standard perspective is of a fold-unfold outline that represents a fisheye view of the semantic net. The reorganization of information also depends on a selection of nodes and their presentation within a connected subnet."

Resolving the issue of rhetorical difference is of particular importance to the teaching of Modern Standard Chinese, since awareness of any such variation is crucial to the development of communicative competence in language learners. In order to contribute to and extend continuing debate, this study employs Rhetorical Structure Theory to analyse rhetorical relations present in Chinese and Australian news-journal text. Results demonstrate considerably less emphasis on backing-up and corroborating claims (evidence relations), and on debates and contentions (opposition, concession and contrast relations) in the Chinese newstexts. This may prove problematic for Australian readers. The relevance of analyses of this type to the classroom is discussed."

   Abstract="Contracts coordinate the interactions between organizations in a business network. Conventional frame contracts often result in ambiguous agreements with operational details unspecified, making it hard to coordinate the network effectively and efficiently. This paper suggests a structured method for designing agreements and ensuring that their terms are observed in business transactions. Based on the assumption that governing a business network means managing the workflow between the member organizations, the contract consists primarily of process models at different levels of detail. A method is proposed for negotiating these models between the member organizations of the network and enacting them with the help of an interorganizational workflow system."

   Abstract="Rhetorical structure in business english discourse has been investigated on the corpus of 150 on-line business news articles published in The Financial Times newspaper. The scope of the study is on the distribution of rhetorical relations that hold between adjacent text spans and characterise journalistic genre on the whole and this particular type as well. Text analysis required building a discourse-tagged corpus in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) which addresses the notion of text coherence through text relations. The structure of analysed articles has been conventionally described by rhetorical relations that establish semantic and functional relations between adjacent text spans. This kind of approach explains coherence by postulating a hierarchical, connected structure of texts, in which every part of a text has a role, a function to play, with respect to other parts in the text. 
The analysis has proved that the articles are organised in the fashion of inverted pyramid, i.e. applying the principle of decreasing interest, which means that the facts are ranged according to their importance, not chronologically as they occured in certain situation, event or problem. 
A discourse-tagged corpus provided hierarchical discourse tree of every article. Further analysis showed the distribution of rhetorical relations through the segments of analyzed discourse tree and stated the most frequent relations in the corpus that characterize journalistic genre. Moreover, the structure of presented information in the articles have been described according to the distribution of relations through several segments of hierarchical discourse tree. The analysis carried out on document level describes the basic structure of business news articles by the means of rhetorical relations."

These are likened to the major split in relations proposed in (M&T 88). Using Paraphrases in an experiment to test readers' intuitions about the source of coherence led to favourable results. The expected paraphrases were generally selected according to the original predictions. A corpus study also indicates that there is some correspondence between text type and the presence of certain relations: pragmatic relations tend to surface in narrative styles, while semantic ones surface in simpler argumentative texts."

This article focuses on the cognitive status of these relations. In an experiment using reading, verification, and free recall tasks, 2 crucial aspects of the structure of expository texts were investigated: the type of coherence relation between segments (problem-solution vs. list) and the linguistic marking of the relations by means of signaling phrases (implicit vs. explicit). Both factors affected text processing. Problem solution relations lead to faster processing, better verification, and superior recall. Explicit marking of the relations resulted in faster processing but did not affect recall. We conclude that the processing of a text segment depends on the relation it has with preceding segments. The relational marker has an effect during online processing, but its influence decreases over time. This contrasts with the effect of the coherence relation, which is also manifest in the recall."

PISA is algorithmic, dependent only upon linguistic and lexical knowledge, and psychologically plausible. This last is attained through the use of relations which have been tested for psychological plausibility in separate research.
Another abstract: Abstract
Intuitions about text structures are formulated in ordered sets of production rules that constitute an analytic procedure so as to solve the indeterminacy for the domain of explanatory texts. Rhetorical structure theory, the linguistic discourse model, & the procedure for incremental structure analysis (PISA) are reviewed in both hierarchical & relational aspects. An illustration of the analytic procedure is in the form of a text of a male, aged 12, trying to explain the use of a telephone. The hierarchical structure of this text is provided, with its relational structure. Hierarchial & relational structures production is detailed, beginning with an overview that includes an inventory of the relevant segment features & a discussion of the input & output of PISA, & an explanation of some of its production rules & the hierarchical structures. Reasons for particular rules & text regularities are outlined, with attention to the structure of explanations, the linguistic markers of text structures, & the flexibility of the procedure. PISA is being used in several current research projects, & its applications for writing behavior, text quality, & procedural & intuitive analysis are considered. 3 Tables, 5 Figures, 1 Appendix, 81 References.

Presents an algorithm which uses a theoretical approach known as Underspecified Segmented Discourse Representation Theory, (USDRT) which is itself a growth out of SDRT and DRT. The gist of USDRT is that the algorithm will never fail to generate tree representation; it is just that any number of the relations at the non-terminal nodes will be left unspecified. Full, accurate diagrams are said to be impossible without either an impossibly large wealth of world knowledge, or some very domain-specific coding."

   Abstract="The linguistic structure of an utterance is known to affect the durational prosody of sounds, words and phrases. There has been increasing interest in how discourse-level organization affects prosody, in part because modeling discourse-level effects could improve the comprehensibility of longer passages of synthesized text. The approach taken here is to look at how topics are sequenced in a text, and how this affects durational prosody when that text is read aloud.Two speakers of American English were recorded reading a set of text materials on 10 separate occasions. Measurements of these recordings indicated that the type of transition in topic between two successive sentences had a significant effect on the amount of sentence-final lengthening, the duration of the pause between sentences, and the speech rate at the end of a sentence and the beginning of the following sentence. These measurements were then used to create a mathematical model of one speaker, and to generate several versions of one of this speaker's original recordings, with each version incorporating different manipulations of the durational patterns and their variability. These versions were played to listeners, who preferred those where the manipulations included durational patterns reflecting the organization of topics in the text. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

the relation is not signalled by an unambiguous discourse marker. It has been proposed that automatically
labelled data, which can be derived from examples in which a discourse relation is unambiguously

However, more recent results suggest that there are problems with this approach, probably due to
the fact that the automatically labelled data has particular properties which are not shared by the
data to which the classifier is then applied. We investigate how big this problem really is and whether
the unrepresentativeness of the automatically labelled data can be overcome by performing
automatic example and feature selection."

   Volume=14,
   Number=3,
   Pages="369-416",
   Abstract="Being able to identify which rhetorical relations (e.g., contrast or explanation) hold between
spans of text is important for many natural language processing applications. Using machine
learning to obtain a classifier which can distinguish between different relations typically
depends on the availability of manually labelled training data, which is very time-consuming
to create. However, rhetorical relations are sometimes lexically marked, i.e., signalled by
discourse markers (e.g., because, but, consequently etc.), and it has been suggested (Marcu
and Echihabi, 2002) that the presence of these cues in some examples can be exploited to
label them automatically with the corresponding relation. The discourse markers are then
removed and the automatically labelled data are used to train a classifier to determine
relations even when no discourse marker is present (based on other linguistic cues such as
word co-occurrences). In this paper, we investigate empirically how feasible this approach
is. In particular, we test whether automatically labelled, lexically marked examples are really
suitable training material for classifiers that are then applied to unmarked examples. Our
results suggest that training on this type of data may not be such a good strategy, as models
trained in this way do not seem to generalise very well to unmarked data. Furthermore, we
found some evidence that this behaviour is largely independent of the classifiers used and
seems to lie in the data itself (e.g., marked and unmarked examples may be too dissimilar
linguistically and removing unambiguous markers in the automatic labelling process may lead
to a meaning shift in the examples)."

The paper develops a three-dimensional approach to metaphor processing, in which metaphors are assumed to have linguistic, conceptual, and communicative functions for the construction of a mental representation of the discourse [Understanding Metaphor in Literature: An Empirical Approach, Longman, London, 1994]. A selection of structural metaphor properties for each of these discourse functions is discussed, and predictions are formulated regarding which variables are deemed to boost metaphor recognition. Five of the eight variables are shown to behave according to the predictions. The other three variables are related to each other and do not conform to the expectations. Some possible explanations of the results and suggestions for further research are offered in the conclusion. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Guidelines for media selection and design for attractiveness, i.e. usability and user experience, are given. The method was evaluated in a case study design of a crowd control simulation training system, which demonstrated the method was usable and gave good solutions against an expert gold standard design. The tool provides advice on media selection and attention effects that match specification of the information content expressed as information types and communication goals. A usability evaluation was carried out to measure the usefulness and effectiveness of the tool in comparison to the method, and the results showed that the tool has a positive impact on multimedia design.

   Publisher="Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation",
   Abstract="A method and apparatus for recognizing the topic structure of language. Language data is divided into simple sentences and a prominent noun portion (PNP) extracted from each. The simple sentences are divided into blocks of data dealing with a single subject. A starting point of at least one topic is detected and a topic introducing region of each topic is determined from block information and language data characteristics. A PNP satisfying a predetermined condition is chosen from the PNPs in each determined topic intro. region as the topic portion (TP) of the topic in the topic intro. region. A topic level indicating a depth of nesting of each topic and a topic scope indicating a region over which the topic continues is determined from the TP and sentences before and after the TP. Sub-topic intro. regions in the remaining area where no topic intro. regions are recognized are determined from block information and language data characteristics. A PNP satisfying a predetermined condition is chosen from the PNPs in each determined sub-topic intro. region as the sub-topic portion (STP) of the sub-topic in the sub-topic intro. region. A temporary topic level indicating a depth of nesting of each sub-topic and a sub-topic scope indicating a region over which the sub-topic continues is determined from the STP and sentences before and after the STP. All determined topics and sub-topics are unified by revising the temporary topic level of each sub-topic according to the topic level of each topic. These topics and their levels are output as a topic structure."

   Abstract="This article integrates existing theoretical perspectives on message content and negotiator motivation to formulate a comprehensive definitional model of the interrelationships among communication behaviors in crisis negotiation. A sample of 189 nuclear dialogue spans were transcribed from 9 resolved cases of hostage negotiation and each utterance coded at the level of thought units across 41 behavioral variables. Results of a nonmetric, multidimensional scaling solution provided clear support for the hypothesized cylindrical structure of communication behavior, revealing 3 dominant levels of suspect-negotiator interaction (Avoidance, Distributive, Integrative). At each level of the structure, interactions were found to modulate around 3 thematic styles of communication (Identity, Instrumental, Relational), which reflected the underlying motivational emphasis of individuals' dialogue. Finally, the intensity of communication was found to play a polarizing role in the cylinder, with intense functionally discrete behaviors occurring toward the boundary of the structure."

Data were 108 interaction episodes transcribed from 12 simulated crisis negotiations and coded at the level of thought units across 41 behavioral variables. Results of a smallest space analysis supported the hypothesized differentiation of communication behavior over 3 facets: overall orientation (Avoidance, Distributive, Integrative), motivational concern (Identity, Instrumental, Relational), and intensity (High to Low). This solution was used as a framework for identifying differences in behavior across simulated and actual negotiations. Analyses showed a systematic pattern of variations in behavior use, with simulated negotiations involving relatively more avoidance-relational and distributive-instrumental behavior than actual negotiations. Predictable differences were also observed in the purpose or function of behavior, with highlyintense behaviors showing greater uniformity in function across contexts compared to lowintensity behaviors."

on the rhetorical status of statements in an article: Material for summaries is selected in such a
way that summaries can highlight the new contribution of the source article and situate it with
respect to earlier work.
We provide a gold standard for summaries of this kind consisting of a substantial corpus of
conference articles in computational linguistics annotated with human judgments of the rhetorical
status and relevance of each sentence in the articles. We present several experiments measuring
our judges’ agreement on these annotations.
We also present an algorithm that, on the basis of the annotated training material, selects
content from unseen articles and classifies it into a fixed set of seven rhetorical categories. The
output of this extraction and classification system can be viewed as a single-document summary
in its own right; alternatively, it provides starting material for the generation of task-oriented
and user-tailored summaries designed to give users an overview of a scientific field."

   Abstract="Rhetorical structure theory, as developed by W. C. Mann & S. A. Thompson (eg, 1989), is outlined & evaluated in terms of its relevance for natural language processing at the level of discourse. Historical roots of the theory are traced to the work of R. E. Longacre (1968) on Philippine languages & J. Beekman & J. Callow (1974) on Bible translation. Relations between text spans are defined in terms of nucleus, satellite, writer, & reader; a taxonomy of relations is exemplified, as are possible schemas & schema applications. Discourse analysis procedure is sketched, & features of text structure are illustrated; it is noted that this model has been used successfully in the analysis of hundreds of texts. Computational implementations of rhetorical structure theory in the area of text planning are described; in the absence of structural cues, however, text analysis in this framework depends on the analyst's intuition regarding the writer's intention & therefore resists computerization. 30 References.

   Volume=25,
   Number=6,
   Pages="763-791",
   Abstract="Although the distinction between 'external' and 'internal' conjunction introduced by Halliday and Hasan (1976) is well established, mainstream studies have, with certain notable exceptions, tended to focus on 'external' types as the core categories and to present 'internal' conjunction as a relatively unmotivated set of pragmatic extensions of the core. The present paper, working within the broad framework of systemic functional linguistics (see, e.g., Halliday and Matthiessen 2004), makes the case for recognizing a more central role for 'internal' conjunction. Current accounts of 'internal' conjunction are reviewed and it is argued that the phenomenon can be defined with more precision than is done at present, even in those models that give it full weight. A more discriminating model of analysis is proposed and related to broader features of the language system. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of assigning greater importance to textual and interpersonal dimensions in descriptions of conjunction."

   Volume=24,
   Number=5,
   Pages="595-611",
   Abstract="The question of what makes a statement “important” in a story was studied. Causal relations were identified between all pairs of events in six folktales, using context-dependent, logical criteria of necessity, and counterfactual tests of the form: If event A had not occurred, then, in the circumstances of the story, event B would not have occurred. Causal networks were derived from these identifications for each story and two properties of them were found to predict judgments of importance: (1) the number of direct causal connections and (2) whether or not an event was in a causal chain from the opening to the closing of the story. The judged importance of a statement increased with the number of causal connections and causal chain membership. Regression analyses showed that substantial proportions of variance were accounted for jointly by both properties and uniquely by causal connections. The importance of a statement, whether identified by structural analysis or judged by naive subjects, seems to be determined by analogous assessments of the statement's causal and logical relations to other statements in the text."

   Pages="809-833",
   Abstract="Characteristic for research on the distinction between main structure and side structure in discourse, a distinction that is central to narrative studies, is the absence of uniformity on the notional level. Studies into this distinction have in common that they fail to provide sufficiently adequate criteria to distinguish side structures from substructures, thereby arriving at a rather problematic distinction between main structure and side structure. The aim of this study is twofold: (i) to propose an adequate, formal definition that provides a general identification criterion for distinguishing main structure from side structure in different types of discourse and (ii) to account for the broader concept of main structure that is implied by this definition. This is done by providing an additional criterion for distinguishing between different types of substructures belonging to this part of the discourse: substructures that ultimately define this part and substructures that, while they are relevant to this leading part, form attached elaborations that other authors have considered to be part of the background. Central to this analysis is the basic structuring function of explicit and implicit topic-forming questions in discourse."

The text strategy used included an interactive frame that used first & second person references signaling involvement & a main body that was both integrative & detached. Formal structures used included passives, attributive adjectives, nominalizations, & participles. An analysis of the sample text in terms of rhetorical structure theory indicated that the comprehensive locus of the effect was in the last paragraph. To test this conclusion, native English speakers (N = 6) & a group of nonnative English learners (N = 18) were asked to identify that part of the text that contained the essence of the text; 4 of the 6 native speakers indicated the last paragraph as the most important, supporting the rhetorical structure theory analysis. Variations in the responses suggest that there are different profiles of discourse organization. 1 Figure, 1 Appendix, 20 References. B. Gadalla",

   Volume=37,

   Pages="1233-1249",
   Abstract="This paper sets out to explore the distinctive features of publicity messages with respect to other kinds of texts. Since the aim of advertising is to point the consumers' ideas in a certain direction, the communicative intention becomes generally constrained by persuasion strategies, such as are studied in pragmatics. Publicity discourse seems to have some specific features which distinguish it from other genres. As regards coherence strategies, previous studies have shown that scientific and technical texts make great use of connectives in order to predict and signal the type of discourse relations and the relation between adjacent elements or sentences. An examination of technical advertisements taken from specialized journals reveals a relatively low number of connectives. In contrast, coherence is maintained with the aid of lexical and semantic resources. Additionally, what we refer to as 'micromarkers' help pinpoint relations. Although these micromarkers have little lexical or semantic content, they are a necessary tool for tying together the concepts they refer to. It turns out that the absence of auxiliary vocabulary, such as connectives, may be an advantage when storing information in the mental reservoir. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It is an important goal of this research not simply to merge the verbalization results of a natural language generator and the visualization results of a knowledge-based graphics generator, but to carefully coordinate graphics and text in such a way that they complement each other. We describe the architecture of the knowledge-based presentation system WIP which guarantees a design process with a large degree of freedom that can be used to tailor the presentation to suit the specific context. In WIP, decisions of the language generator may influence graphics generation and graphical constraints may sometimes force decisions in the language production process. In this paper, we focus on the influence of graphical constraints on text generation. In particular, we describe the generation of cross-modal references, the revision of text due to graphical constraints and the clarification of graphics through text."

   Abstract="The aim of this investigation is to explore the role of argumentation schemes in enthymeme reconstruction. This aim is pursued by studying selected cases of incomplete arguments in natural language discourse to see what the requirements are for filling in the unstated premises and conclusions in some systematic and useful way. Some of these cases are best handled using deductive tools, while others respond best to an analysis based on defeasible argumentations schemes. The approach is also shown to work reasonably well for weak arguments, a class of arguments that has always been difficult to analyze without the principle of charity producing a straw man."

   Abstract="Scheduling dialogs, during which people negotiate the times of appointments, are common in everyday life. This paper reports the results of an in-depth empirical investigation of resolving explicit temporal references in scheduling dialogs. There are four phases of this work: data annotation and evaluation, model development, system implementation and evaluation, and model evaluation and analysis. The system and model were developed primarily on one set of data, and then applied later to a much more complex data set, to assess the generalizability of the model for the task being performed. Many different types of empirical methods are applied to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Detailed annotation instructions were developed and an intercoder reliability study was performed, showing that naive annotators can reliably perform the targeted annotations. A fully automatic system has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data, with good results on both data sets. We adopt a pure realization of a recency-based focus model to identify precisely when it is and is not adequate for the task being addressed. In addition to system results, an in-depth evaluation of the model itself is presented, based on detailed manual annotations. The results are that few errors occur specifically due to the model of focus being used, and the set of anaphoric relations defined in the model are low in ambiguity for both data sets."

   School="The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill",
   Type="Ph.D. dissertation",
   Abstract="The purpose of this research was to intensively study 11 literary studies articles about the fictional character from James Joyce's Ulysses , Molly Bloom. A typology was qualitatively developed for coding word types, and Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Maim & Thompson, 1987) was used to code sentence roles, or functions, such as background, evidence, thesis, etc. A few sentence roles in addition to those found in RST were used. A goal of the study was to develop rules for selecting sentences from the articles to represent them. A number of analyses were done to further this goal: the distributions of word types and sentence role types within the various articles were counted; the occurrences of word types within sentences of particular roles were found; the bigrams (two-word type pairs) within sentences of different sentence roles were counted. In addition, the number of times sentence role types followed other sentence roles was counted, and the agreement (percentage of word types shared) between sentence roles that followed other sentence roles was calculated. Z-scores (Smajda, 1993) were used to determine when bigrams and followed-by pairs were comparatively frequent. A study of the occurrence of actual “phrases” (real combinations of word-types, as opposed to simple co-occurrence pairs, or bigrams) was done. Chi-square goodness of fit tests revealed that in some cases the distributions of actually occurring word combinations across sentence roles differed from the overall distributions of sentence roles. The quantitative results and qualitative observations were used to generate sentence extraction rules. The qualitatively derived rule for macroparadigmatic articles (those which apply a theory to a literary work or discuss it in comparison with another work) (Fahnestock and Secor, 1991) worked better than the quantitatively derived rules, in many cases yielding coherent, not overly concrete extracts that captured main points of the articles. The macroparadigmatic rule and another less satisfactory one for concrete articles were applied to 21 additional articles."

We present a method for annotating discourse coherence structures that we used to manually annotate a database of 135 texts from theWall Street Journal and the AP Newswire. All texts were independently annotated by two annotators. Kappa values of greater than 0.8 indicated good interannotator agreement. We furthermore present evidence that trees are not a descriptively adequate data structure for representing discourse structure: In coherence structures of naturally occurring texts, we found many different kinds of crossed dependencies, as well as many nodes with multiple parents. The claims are supported by statistical results from our hand-annotated database of 135 texts."

   Pages="1643-1662",
   Abstract="We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(s) that can be preserved after summarization. Here, a concept refers to an abstract or concrete entity or its action often expressed by diverse terms in text. Summary generation can thus be considered as an optimization problem of selecting a set of sentences with minimal answer loss. In this paper, we propose a document concept lattice that indexes the hierarchy of local topics tied to a set of frequent concepts and the corresponding sentences containing these topics. The local topics will specify the promising sub-spaces related to the selected concepts and sentences. Based on this lattice, the summary is an optimized selection of a set of distinct and salient local topics that lead to maximal coverage of concepts with the given number of sentences. Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow-on tests. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   Volume=2869,
   Pages="592-600",
   Abstract="In this study, compared to the existing one, a more realistic evaluation method for discourse segmentation is introduced. It is believed that discourse segmentation is a fuzzy task [Pas96]. Human subjects may agree on different discourse boundaries, with high agreement among them. In the existing method a threshold value is calculated and sentences that marked by that many subjects are decided as real boundaries and other marks are not been considered. Furthermore automatically discovered boundaries, in case of being misplaced, are treated as a strict failure, disregarding the proximity wrt to the human found boundaries. The proposed method overcomes these shortcomings, and credits the fuzziness of the human subjects' decisions as well as tolerates misplacements of the automated discovery. The proposed method is tunable from crisp/harsh to fuzzy/tolerant on human decision as well as automated discovery handling."

   Pages="283-308",
   Abstract="The outline (table of contents) of a document provides users with a hierarchical view of the document's logical structure. Outlines reflect a conceptual model and can serve as a cognitive aid in reading and writing hypertext. Outlines may have balance along three dimensions: skeletal, lexical, and semantic. When outlines contain balance, alternative views of the outline are readily imagined. Furthermore, hypertext systems can automatically generate alternative outlines with a modified, depth-first traversal of the hypertext links and nodes. Methods for building and maintaining balanced outlines have been successfully used by writers. Readers are aware of the potential of balance and alternative outlines but lack strategies for utilizing them."

   Abstract="Multi-document discourse analysis has emerged with the potential of improving various NLP applications. Based on the newly proposed Cross-document Structure Theory (CST), this paper describes an empirical study that classifies CST relationships between sentence pairs extracted from topically related documents, exploiting both labeled and unlabeled data. We investigate a binary classifier for determining existence of structural relationships and a full classifier using the full taxonomy of relationships. We show that in both cases the exploitation of unlabeled data helps improve the performance of learned classifiers."

   Abstract="We present a strategy on manual annotation of texts reporting occurrences to reveal the discourse structure. Events are chosen as the elementary units in annotation. The nature and the categories of events in discourse are explored in detail. The extraction of event patterns and annotation of events are also discussed. We have annotated 60 texts according to the method above and the experiment shows about 78% sentences can be annotated in great detail."
