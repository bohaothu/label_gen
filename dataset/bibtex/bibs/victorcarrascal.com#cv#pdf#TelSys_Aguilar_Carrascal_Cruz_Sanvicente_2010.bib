	abstract = {The number of portable electronic devices capa-
ble of maintaining wireless communications increases day
by day. Such mobile nodes may easily self-configure to
form a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) without the
help of any established infrastructure. As the number of
mobile devices grows, the demand of multimedia services
such as video-streaming from these networks is foreseen
to increase as well. This paper presents a proposal which
seeks to improve the experience of the end users in such
environment. The proposal is called dCW-MMDSR (dy-
namic Contention Window-Multipath Multimedia Dynamic
Source Routing), a cross-layer multipath routing protocol
which includes techniques to achieve a dynamic assignment
of the Contention Window of the IEEE 802.11e MAC level.
In addition, it includes multipath routing suitable for layered
coded video to improve the performance of the service. The
operation is simple and suitable for low capacity wireless
devices. Simulations show the benefits under different sce-
narios.},
