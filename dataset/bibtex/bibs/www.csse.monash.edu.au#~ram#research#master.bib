	and actions that arise from them. This means that a test cannot be
	valid per se; rather, its validity depends on the uses to which the
	results are put. For example, in educational measurement a test may
	be used to determine whether to promote a student to a higher class.
	In this case, the test is valid to the extent that the students promoted
	are ready for such promotion and the students not promoted are unready.
	Validity is a matter of degree; no test can be said to be completely
	valid or invalid. Moreover, as time passes more evidence regarding
	the validity of the test will accrue (and the context of the test
	itself may change), so validation is an ongoing process rather than
	a stage that can be passed through.
	
	
	This paper gives an overview of qualitative and quantitative approaches
	to validation. In accordance with Messick's concept of validity as
	dependent on context, quantitative approaches are never allowed to

	exams do not evaluate students' competence in terms of the demands
	of highly standardized research articles written in English, which
	will be needed for the student to review the literature of his/her
	research area. In order to overcome this limitation we implemented
	a web-based, fully automated system for English Proficiency tests,
	named CAPTEAP, which checks the students' ability in the use of English
	for academic purposes. In this paper, we describe how CAPTEAP assesses
	high-order skills of Bloom's taxonomy, where students are assessed
	in their reception and familiarity with the schematic structure of
	scientific papers. CAPTEAP employs the resources of a case-based
	reasoning tool to assist non-English speakers in producing scientific
	papers. It comprises 4 modules, through which students are evaluated
	with regard to their ability to: i) analyze the structure of a given
	section of a paper; ii) analyze relationships among clauses signalled
	by discourse markers; iii) recognize conventions and rhetorical functions
	in English from scientific texts; iv) identify writing strategies

	We have discovered the following advantages with computer assisted
	assessment in our programming course: the students get plenty of
	practice in programming, they get fast feedback and can easily move
	onto more advanced problems as their skill develops.

	of presentation of the assessment and feedback, and student impressions

	and research investigations as well as some methods that have not

	with a discussion of the importance of establishing collaborations

  journal = {Journal of Information Technology Education},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Using an on-line learning environment, students from four European
	countries collaborated and communicated to carry out problem-based
	learning in occupational therapy. The students never met each other
	face-to-face but carried out much of their communication through
	the medium of on-line synchronous tutorials. The aim of the synchronous
	group tutorials was to allow the students to complete two assignments.
	The first was a problem-based case study, using group discussions
	and investigation, to recommend high-level assistive technological
	solutions for clients who were physically and/or mentally impaired.
	The second was a reflective account of their learning through the
	Occupational Therapy Internet School pilot course.
	
	
	The effectiveness of this learning approach was evaluated by means
	of the final assessments and published learning outcomes. In particular,
	transcripts from peer-to-peer sessions of synchronous communication
	were analysed using the SOLO taxonomy to establish the extent to
	which deep learning had taken place. The development of deep learning
	was studied week by week through the transcripts of the synchronous
	tutorials. This allowed the quality of the course to be appraised
	and revealed, to a certain extent, the impact of this on-line international
	course on the learning strategies of the students.
	
	
	Results showed differences between the four tutorial groups in their
	approach to the `process' of doing the case study assignment and
	its `content'. Statements taken from the transcripts were categorised
	by the SOLO level displayed and it could be seen that the students
	were achieving the learning outcome as the course progressed. The
	conclusions of this analysis of learning outcomes and assessment
	indicate that synchronous communication and on-line meetings between
	course participants can support deep learning, although this does
	not happen spontaneously. More work needs to be done to establish
	an appropriate balance between the tutors' intervention and the students'
	autonomous and collaborative learning in an on-line course.},

	potential of fully using previously unreleased data from the nationally
	normed Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination to assess learning
	in key engineering and science topics. In the past, very limited
	information was released by the National Council of Examiners for
	Engineers and Surveyors (NCEES) for the eight hour FE examination,
	which is composed of 150-200 questions in ten morning and five afternoon
	topics. For the purposes ofthis project the NCEES agreed to release
	information to the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) to permit the
	value of the FE data in describing UMR student learning in key engineering
	and science topics to be assessed. 
	
	
	The analysis ofthe FE data was undertaken in the period 19931996 for
	students in twelve engineering disciplines at UMR The overall conclusion
	of the project is that the enhanced level of data released from the
	FE by NCEES is of value to individual programs, schools and institutions
	in assessing student learning and in identifying areas of concern.
	However, the overall value of this information is compromised by
	variable student motivation and the confidentiality of the questions
	used in the exam. Other conclusions are that UMR student scores are
	below faculty expectations, that the FE exam is not equally applicable
	to all engineering disciplines, and that the academic level of the
	exam may be lower than faculty thought.},
