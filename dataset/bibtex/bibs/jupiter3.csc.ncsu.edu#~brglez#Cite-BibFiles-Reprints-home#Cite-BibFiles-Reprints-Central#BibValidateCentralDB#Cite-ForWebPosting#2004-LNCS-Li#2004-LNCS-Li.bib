Advances in local-search SAT solvers have traditionally been presented in
the context of local search solvers only. The most recent and rather comprehensive
comparisons between UnitWalk and several versions of WalkSAT demonstrate that neither
solver dominates on all benchmarks. \QTTWO\ (a `dragonfly' in Mandarin) is a SAT solver
script that relies on a novel switching strategy to invoke one of the two local search
solvers: \WS\ or \QTONE. The local search solver \QTONE\ implements the \UW\ algorithm
with a new unit-propagation technique. The experimental methodology we use not only
demonstrates the effectiveness of the switching strategy and the efficiency of the new
unit-propagation implementation -- it also supports, on the very same instances,
statistically significant performance evaluation between local search and other
state-of-the-art DPLL-based SAT solvers. The resulting comparisons show a surprising
pattern of solver dominance, completely unanticipated when we began this work.
