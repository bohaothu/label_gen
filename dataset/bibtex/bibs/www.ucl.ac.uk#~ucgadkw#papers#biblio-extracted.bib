  review       = { Synopsis [From www.Amazon.co.uk] When
                  Western scholars write about non-Western
                  societies, do they inevitably perpetuate
                  the myths of European imperialism? Can
                  they ever articulate the meanings and
                  logics of non-Western peoples? Who has
                  the right to speak for whom? Questions
                  such as these are debated in this text.
                  Marshall Sahlins addresses these issues
                  head on, while building a case for the
                  ability of anthropologists orking in the
                  Western tradition to nderstand other
                  cultures. In recent years, these
                  questions have arisen in debates over
                  the death and deification of Captain
                  James Cook on Hawaii Island in 1779. Did
                  the Hawaiians truly receive Cook as a
                  manifestation of their own god Lono? Or
                  were they too pragmatic, too
                  worldly-wise to accept the foreigner as
                  a god? Moreover, can a ``non-native''
                  scholar give voice to a ``native'' point
                  of view? This volume seeks to go far
                  beyond specialized debates about the
                  alleged superiority of Western
                  traditions. The culmination of Sahlins's
                  ethnohistorical research on Hawaii, is a
                  reaffirmation for understanding
                  difference.},
