	It presents and discusses the results of our system on the opinion
	analysis task. It also presents our experiments of opinion analysis
	on the two corpora MPQA and NTCIR-6, by using our learning based
	system. Our system was base on the SVM learning. It achieved state
	of the art results on the MPQA corpus for the two problems, opinionated
	sentence recognition and opinion holder extraction. The results using
	the NTCIR-6 English corpus for both training and testing are certainly
	among the first ones. Our results on the opinionated sentence recognition
	sub-task of the NTCIR-6 were encouraging. The results on the English
	evaluation of the NTCIR-6 opinion analysis task were obtained from
	the models learned from the MPQA corpus. The lower results on the
	NTCIR-6 opinion holder extraction subtask, in comparison with those
	using each corpus for both training and testing, may possibly show
	that there exist substantial differences between the MPQA corpus
	and the NTCIR-6 English corpus},

title = {A Two-Dimensional Topic-Aspect Model for Discovering Multi-Faceted Topics},
booktitle = {AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2010},

abstract = {This paper presents the Topic-Aspect Model (TAM), a  Bayesian mixture model which jointly discovers topics  and aspects. We broadly define an aspect of a document  as a characteristic that spans the document, such as an  underlying theme or perspective. Unlike previous models  which cluster words by topic or aspect, our model  can generate token assignments in both of these dimensions,  rather than assuming words come from only one  of two orthogonal models. We present two applications  of the model. First, we model a corpus of computational  linguistics abstracts, and find that the scientific topics  identified in the data tend to include both a computational  aspect and a linguistic aspect. For example, the  computational aspect of GRAMMAR emphasizes parsing,  whereas the linguistic aspect focuses on formal languages.  Secondly, we show that the model can capture  different viewpoints on a variety of topics in a corpus  of editorials about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We  show both qualitative and quantitative improvements in  TAM over two other state-of-the-art topic models.},
