                 (SVMs). We have been actively developing this package
                 since the year 2000. The goal is to help users to
                 easily apply SVM to their applications. LIBSVM has
                 gained wide popularity in machine learning and many
                 other areas. In this article, we present all
                 implementation details of LIBSVM. Issues such as
                 solving SVM optimization problems theoretical
                 convergence multiclass classification probability
                 estimates and parameter selection are discussed in
                 detail.",

  abstract =     "Malicious Web sites are a cornerstone of Internet
                 criminal activities. The dangers of these sites have
                 created a demand for safeguards that protect end-users
                 from visiting them. This article explores how to detect
                 malicious Web sites from the lexical and host-based
                 features of their URLs. We show that this problem lends
                 itself naturally to modern algorithms for online
                 learning. Online algorithms not only process large
                 numbers of URLs more efficiently than batch algorithms,
                 they also adapt more quickly to new features in the
                 continuously evolving distribution of malicious URLs.
                 We develop a real-time system for gathering URL
                 features and pair it with a real-time feed of labeled
                 URLs from a large Web mail provider. From these
                 features and labels, we are able to train an online
                 classifier that detects malicious Web sites with 99\%
                 accuracy over a balanced dataset.",
