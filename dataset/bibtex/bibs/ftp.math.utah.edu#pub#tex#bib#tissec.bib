  abstract =     "The important problem of user password selection is
                 addressed and a new proactive password-checking
                 technique is presented. In a training phase, a decision
                 tree is generated based on a given dictionary of weak
                 passwords. Then, the decision tree is used to determine
                 whether a user password should be accepted.
                 Experimental results described here show that the
                 method leads to a very high dictionary compression (up
                 to 1000 to 1) with low error rates (of the order of
                 1\%). A prototype implementation, called ProCheck, is
                 made available online. We survey previous approaches to
                 proactive password checking, and provide an in-depth

                 object-oriented systems. The decision of whether an
                 information flow is permitted or denied depends on both
                 the authorizations specified on the objects and the
                 process by which information is obtained and
                 transmitted. Depending on the specific computations, a
                 process accessing sensitive information could still be
                 allowed to release information to users who are not
                 allowed to directly access it. Exceptions to the
                 permissions and restrictions stated by the
                 authorizations are specified by means of exceptions
                 associated with methods. Two kinds of exceptions are
                 considered: {\em invoke exceptions,\/} applicable
                 during a method execution and {\em reply exceptions\/}
                 applicable to the information returned by a method.
                 Information flowing from one object into another or
                 returned to the user is subject to the different
                 exceptions specified for the methods enforcing the
                 transmission. We formally characterize information
                 transmission and flow in a transaction and define the
                 conditions for safe information flow. We define
                 security specifications and characterize safe
                 information flows. We propose an approach to control
                 unsafe flows and present an algorithm to enforce it. We
                 also illustrate an efficient implementation of our
                 controls and present some experimental results

                 Crowds, named for the notion of ``blending into a
                 crowd,'' operates by grouping users into a large and
                 geographically diverse group (crowd) that collectively
                 issues requests on behalf of its members. Web servers
                 are unable to learn the true source of a request
                 because it is equally likely to have originated from
                 any member of the crowd, and even collaborating crowd
                 members cannot distinguish the originator of a request
                 from a member who is merely forwarding the request on

  abstract =     "Many multilevel relational models have been proposed;
                 different models offer different advantages. In this
                 paper, we adapt and refine several of the best ideas
                 from previous models and add new ones to build the new
                 Multilevel Relational (MLR) data model. MLR provides
                 multilevel relations with element-level labeling as a
                 natural extension of the traditional relational data
                 model. MLR introduces several new concepts (notably,
                 data-borrow integrity and the UPLEVEL statement) and
                 significantly redefines existing concepts
                 (polyinstantiation and referential integrity as well as
                 data manipulation operations). A central contribution
                 of this paper is proofs of soundness, completeness, and
                 security of MLR. A new {\em data-based\/} semantics is
                 given for the MLR data model by combining ideas from
                 SeaView, belief-based semantics, and LDV. This new
                 semantics has the advantages of both eliminating
                 ambiguity and retaining upward information flow. MLR is
                 secure, unambiguous, and powerful. It has five
                 integrity properties and five operations for
                 manipulating multilevel relations. Soundness,
                 completeness, and security show that any of the five
                 database manipulation operations will keep database
                 states legal (i.e., satisfy all integrity properties),
                 that every legal database state can be constructed, and
                 that MLR is noninterfering. The expressive power of MLR
                 also compares favorably with several other models.",

                 Nyanchama and Osborn, and the role-graph model with its
                 accompanying algorithms, which is one way of
                 implementing role-role relationships. An alternative
                 role insertion algorithm is added, and it is shown how
                 the role creation policies of Fernandez et al.
                 correspond to role addition algorithms in our model. We
                 then use our reference model to provide a taxonomy for
                 kinds of conflict. We then go on to consider in some
                 detail privilege-privilege and role-role conflicts in
                 conjunction with the role graph model. We show how
                 role-role conflicts lead to a partitioning of the role
                 graph into nonconflicting collections that can together
                 be safely authorized to a given user. Finally, in an

  abstract =     "In recent years, workflow management systems (WFMSs)
                 have gained popularity in both research and commercial
                 sectors. WFMSs are used to coordinate and streamline
                 business processes. Very large WFMSs are often used in
                 organizations with users in the range of several
                 thousands and process instances in the range of tens
                 and thousands. To simplify the complexity of security
                 administration, it is common practice in many
                 businesses to allocate a role for each activity in the
                 process and then assign one or more users to each
                 role---granting an authorization to roles rather than
                 to users. Typically, security policies are expressed as
                 constraints (or rules) on users and roles; {\em
                 separation of duties\/} is a well-known constraint.
                 Unfortunately, current role-based access control models
                 are not adequate to model such constraints. To address
                 this issue we (1) present a language to express both
                 static and dynamic authorization constraints as clauses
                 in a logic program; (2) provide formal notions of
                 constraint consistency; and (3) propose algorithms to
                 check the consistency of constraints and assign users
                 and roles to tasks that constitute the workflow in such
                 a way that no constraints are violated.",

                 motivation is to simplify administration of
                 authorizations. An appealing possibility is to use RBAC
                 itself to manage RBAC, to further provide
                 administrative convenience and scalability, especially
                 in decentralizing administrative authority,
                 responsibility, and chores. This paper describes the
                 motivation, intuition, and formal definition of a new
                 role-based model for RBAC administration. This model is
                 called ARBAC97 (administrative RBAC '97) and has three

                 each able to authenticate the next in the path, is a
                 well-known technique for authenticating entities in a
                 large-scale system. Recent work has extended this
                 technique to include multiple paths in an effort to
                 bolster authentication, but the success of this
                 approach may be unclear in the face of intersecting
                 paths, ambiguities in the meaning of certificates, and
                 interdependencies in the use of different keys. Thus,
                 several authors have proposed metrics to evaluate the
                 confidence afforded by a set of paths. In this paper we
                 develop a set of guiding principles for the design of
                 such metrics. We motivate our principles by showing how
                 previous approaches failed with respect to these
                 principles and what the consequences to authentication
                 might be. We then propose a new metric that appears to
                 meet our principles, and so to be a satisfactory metric

                 and application access control requirements to be
                 enforced on applications composed from downloaded
                 executable content. Downloaded executable content
                 consists of messages downloaded from remote hosts that
                 contain executables that run, upon receipt, on the
                 downloading principal's machine. Unless restricted,
                 this content can perform malicious actions, including
                 accessing its downloading principal's private data and
                 sending messages on this principal's behalf. Current
                 security architectures for controlling downloaded
                 executable content (e.g., JDK 1.2) enable specification
                 of access control requirements for content based on its
                 provider and identity. Since these access control
                 requirements must cover every legal use of the class,
                 they may include rights that are not necessary for a
                 particular application of content. Therefore, using
                 these systems, an application composed from downloaded
                 executable content cannot enforce its access control
                 requirements without the addition of
                 application-specific security mechanisms. In this
                 paper, we define an access control model with the
                 following properties: (1) system administrators can
                 define system access control requirements on
                 applications and (2) application developers can use the
                 same model to enforce application access control
                 requirements without the need for ad hoc security
                 mechanisms. This access control model uses features of
                 role-based access control models to enable (1)
                 specification of a single role that applies to multiple
                 application instances; (2) selection of a content's
                 access rights based on the content's application and
                 role in the application; (3) consistency maintained
                 between application state and content access rights;
                 and (4) control of role administration. We detail a
                 system architecture that uses this access control model
                 to implement secure collaborative applications. Lastly,
                 we describe an implementation of this architecture,

  abstract =     "We study protocols for strong authentication and key
                 exchange in asymmetric scenarios where the
                 authentication server possesses a pair of private and
                 public keys while the client has only a weak
                 human-memorizable password as its authentication key.
                 We present and analyze several simple password
                 authentication protocols in this scenario, and show
                 that the security of these protocols can be formally
                 proven based on standard cryptographic assumptions.
                 Remarkably, our analysis shows optimal resistance to
                 off-line password guessing attacks under the choice of
                 suitable public key encryption functions. In addition
                 to user authentication, we describe ways to enhance
                 these protocols to provide two-way authentication,
                 authenticated key exchange, defense against server's
                 compromise, and user anonymity. We complement these
                 results with a proof that strongly indicates that
                 public key techniques are unavoidable for password
                 protocols that resist off-line guessing attacks.
                 \par

                 As a further contribution, we introduce the notion of
                 {\em public passwords\/} that enables the use of the
                 above protocols in situations where the client's
                 machine does not have the means to validate the
                 server's public key. Public passwords serve as
                 ``hand-held certificates'' that the user can carry

                 effective way of protecting an enterprise network from
                 unauthorized access. However, it will not work
                 efficiently in an ATM network because it requires the
                 termination of end-to-end ATM connections at a
                 packet-filtering router, which incurs huge overhead of
                 SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly). Very few approaches
                 to this problem have been proposed in the literature,
                 and none is completely satisfactory. In this paper we
                 present the hardware design of a high-speed ATM
                 firewall that does not require the termination of an
                 end-to-end connection in the middle. We propose a novel

                 different strength to traffic with different risk
                 levels and show how it can be implemented in our
                 firewall. Compared with the traditional firewalls, this
                 ATM firewall performs exactly the same packet-level
                 filtering without compromising the performance and has
                 the same ``look and feel'' by sitting at the chokepoint
                 between the trusted ATM LAN and untrusted ATM WAN. It

                 of learning to characterize the behaviors of an
                 individual, system, or network in terms of temporal
                 sequences of discrete data. We present an approach on
                 the basis of instance-based learning (IBL) techniques.
                 To cast the anomaly-detection task in an IBL framework,
                 we employ an approach that transforms temporal
                 sequences of discrete, unordered observations into a
                 metric space via a similarity measure that encodes
                 intra-attribute dependencies. Classification boundaries
                 are selected from an {\em a posteriori\/}
                 characterization of valid user behaviors, coupled with
                 a domain heuristic. An empirical evaluation of the
                 approach on user command data demonstrates that we can
                 accurately differentiate the profiled user from
                 alternative users when the available features encode
                 sufficient information. Furthermore, we demonstrate
                 that the system detects anomalous conditions {\em
                 quickly\/} --- an important quality for reducing
                 potential damage by a malicious user. We present
                 several techniques for reducing data storage
                 requirements of the user profile, including
                 instance-selection methods and clustering. As empirical
                 evaluation shows that a new greedy clustering algorithm

                 small loss in accuracy.",

                 secure and pseudonymous relationships with multiple
                 servers. The setting is such that clients reside on a
                 particular subnet (e.g., corporate intranet, ISP) and
                 the servers reside anywhere on the Internet. The Janus
                 engine allows each client-server relationship to use
                 either weak or strong authentication on each
                 interaction. At the same time, each interaction
                 preserves privacy by neither revealing a clients true
                 identity (except for the subnet) nor the set of servers
                 with which a particular client interacts. Furthermore,
                 clients do not need any secure long-term memory,

                 techniques. A timing attack is, essentially, a way of
                 obtaining some users private information by carefully
                 measuring the time it takes the user to carry out
                 cryptographic operations. In this work, we analyze two
                 implementations of DES. We show that a timing attack
                 yields the Hamming weight of the key used by both DES
                 implementations. Moreover, the attack is
                 computationally inexpensive. We also show that all the
                 design characteristics of the target system, necessary
                 to carry out the timing attack, can be inferred from
                 timing measurements.",

                 attack on WEP, the link-layer security protocol for
                 802.11b wireless networks. The attack is based on a
                 partial key exposure vulnerability in the RC4 stream
                 cipher discovered by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir. This
                 paper describes how to apply this flaw to breaking WEP,
                 our implementation of the attack, and optimizations
                 that can be used to reduce the number of packets
                 required for the attack. We conclude that the 802.11b
                 WEP standard is completely insecure, and we provide
                 recommendations on how this vulnerability could be
                 mitigated and repaired.",

                 password-based authenticated key exchange protocols, in
                 the common reference string model. Our protocol is
                 actually an abstraction of the key exchange protocol of
                 Katz et al. and is based on the recently introduced
                 notion of smooth projective hashing by Cramer and
                 Shoup. We gain a number of benefits from this
                 abstraction. First, we obtain a modular protocol that
                 can be described using just three high-level
                 cryptographic tools. This allows a simple and intuitive
                 understanding of its security. Second, our proof of
                 security is significantly simpler and more modular.
                 Third, we are able to derive analogs to the Katz et al.
                 protocol under additional cryptographic assumptions.
                 Specifically, in addition to the DDH assumption used by
                 Katz et al., we obtain protocols under both the
                 quadratic and N-residuosity assumptions. In order to
                 achieve this, we construct new smooth projective hash

  abstract =     "The administration of large role-based access control
                 (RBAC) systems is a challenging problem. In order to
                 administer such systems, decentralization of
                 administration tasks by the use of delegation is an
                 effective approach. While the use of delegation greatly
                 enhances flexibility and scalability, it may reduce the
                 control that an organization has over its resources,
                 thereby diminishing a major advantage RBAC has over
                 discretionary access control (DAC). We propose to use
                 security analysis techniques to maintain desirable
                 security properties while delegating administrative
                 privileges. We give a precise definition of a family of
                 security analysis problems in RBAC, which is more
                 general than safety analysis that is studied in the
                 literature. We show that two classes of problems in the
                 family can be reduced to similar analysis in the
                 RT[$\leftarrow,\cap$] role-based trust-management
                 language, thereby establishing an interesting
                 relationship between RBAC and the RT framework. The
                 reduction gives efficient algorithms for answering most
                 kinds of queries in these two classes and establishes
                 the complexity bounds for the intractable cases.",

                 secret-sharing-based family of revocation schemes of
                 Naor and Pinkas [2003]. The basic scheme of [Naor and
                 Pinkas 2000] uses Shamir's polynomial secret-sharing to
                 revoke up to r users, where r is the degree of the
                 secret-sharing polynomial, and it is information
                 theoretically secure against coalitions of up to r
                 collaborators. The nonrevoked users use Lagrange
                 interpolation in order to compute the new key. Our
                 basic scheme uses a novel modification of Shamir's
                 polynomial secret-sharing: The secret equals the
                 leading coefficient of the polynomial (as opposed to
                 the free coefficient as in the original scheme) and the
                 polynomial is reconstructed by Newton interpolation
                 (rather than Lagrange interpolation). Comparing our
                 scheme to one variant of the Naor--Pinkas scheme, we
                 offer revocation messages that are shorter by a factor
                 of almost 2, while the computation cost at the user end
                 is smaller by a constant factor of approximately 13/2.
                 Comparing to a second variant of the Naor--Pinkas
                 scheme, our scheme offers a reduction of O ( r ) in the
                 computation cost at the user end, without affecting any
                 of the other performance parameters. We then extend our
                 basic scheme to perform multiround revocation for
                 stateless and stateful receivers, along the lines
                 offered by Naor and Pinkas [2000] and Kogan et al.
                 [2003]. We show that using Newton rather than Lagrange
                 interpolants enables a significantly more efficient
                 transmission of the new revocation message and shorter
                 response time for each round. Pay TV systems that
                 implement broadcast encryption techniques can benefit
                 significantly from the improved efficiency offered by
                 our revocation schemes.",

                 mobile applications requires the definition of
                 spatially aware access-control systems. Even if some
                 approaches have already been proposed either in the
                 context of geographic database systems or context-aware
                 applications, a comprehensive framework, general and
                 flexible enough to deal with spatial aspects in real
                 mobile applications, is still missing. In this paper,
                 we make one step toward this direction and present
                 GEO-RBAC, an extension of the RBAC model enhanced with
                 spatial-and location-based information. In GEORBAC,
                 spatial entities are used to model objects, user
                 positions, and geographically bounded roles. Roles are
                 activated based on the position of the user. Besides a
                 physical position, obtained from a given mobile
                 terminal or a cellular phone, users are also assigned a
                 logical and device-independent position, representing
                 the feature (the road, the town, the region) in which
                 they are located. To enhance flexibility and
                 reusability, we also introduce the concept of role
                 schema, specifying the name of the role, as well as the
                 type of the role spatial boundary and the granularity
                 of the logical position. We then extend GEO-RBAC to
                 support hierarchies, modeling permission, user, and
                 activation inheritance, and separation of duty
                 constraints. The proposed classes of constraints extend
                 the conventional ones to deal with different
                 granularities (schema/instance level) and spatial
                 information. We conclude the paper with an analysis of

  abstract =     "Integration of version and access control of XML
                 documents has the benefit of regulating access to
                 rapidly growing archives of XML documents. Versioned
                 XML documents provide us with valuable information on
                 dependencies between document nodes, but, at the same
                 time, presenting the risk of undesirable data
                 disclosure. In this article, we introduce the notion of
                 relevancy-based access control, which realizes
                 protection of versioned XML documents by various types
                 of relevancy, such as version dependencies, schema
                 similarities, and temporal proximity. We define a new
                 path query language XVerPath over XML document
                 versions, which can be utilized for specifying
                 relevancy-based access-control policies. We also
                 introduce the notion of relevancy class, for
                 collectively and compactly specifying relevancy-based
                 policies. Regarding efficient processing of access
                 requests, we propose the packed version model, which
                 realizes space-efficient difference-based archives of
                 versioned XML documents and, at the same time,
                 providing efficient evaluation of XVerPath queries.
                 Experimental results show reasonable performance
                 superiority over conventional methods, which do not

  abstract =     "Signature-based network intrusion-detection systems
                 (NIDSs) often report a massive number of simple alerts
                 of low-level security-related events. Many of these
                 alerts are logically involved in a single multi-stage
                 intrusion incident and a security officer often wants
                 to analyze the complete incident instead of each
                 individual simple alert. This paper proposes a
                 well-structured model that abstracts the logical
                 relation between the alerts in order to support
                 automatic correlation of those alerts involved in the
                 same intrusion. The basic building block of the model
                 is a logical formula called a capability. We use
                 capability to abstract consistently and precisely all
                 levels of accesses obtained by the attacker in each
                 step of a multistage intrusion. We then derive
                 inference rules to define logical relations between
                 different capabilities. Based on the model and the
                 inference rules, we have developed several novel alert
                 correlation algorithms and implemented a prototype
                 alert correlator. The experimental results of the
                 correlator using several intrusion datasets demonstrate
                 that the approach is effective in both alert fusion and
                 alert correlation and has the ability to correlate
                 alerts of complex multistage intrusions. In several
                 instances, the alert correlator successfully correlated
                 more than two thousand Snort alerts involved in massive
                 scanning incidents. It also helped us find two
                 multistage intrusions that were missed in auditing by
                 the security officers.",

  abstract =     "Separation-of-duty (SoD) is widely considered to be a
                 fundamental principle in computer security. A static
                 SoD (SSoD) policy states that in order to have all
                 permissions necessary to complete a sensitive task, the
                 cooperation of at least a certain number of users is
                 required. Role-based access control (RBAC) is today's
                 dominant access-control model. It is widely believed
                 that one of RBAC's main strengths is that it enables
                 the use of constraints to support policies, such as
                 separation-of-duty. In the literature on RBAC,
                 statically mutually exclusive roles (SMER) constraints
                 are used to enforce SSoD policies. In this paper, we
                 formulate and study fundamental computational problems
                 related to the use of SMER constraints to enforce SSoD
                 policies. We show that directly enforcing SSoD policies
                 is intractable (coNP-complete), while checking whether
                 an RBAC state satisfies a set of SMER constraints is
                 efficient; however, verifying whether a given set of
                 SMER constraints enforces an SSoD policy is also
                 intractable (coNP-complete). We discuss the
                 implications of these results. We show also how to
                 generate SMER constraints that are as accurate as
                 possible for enforcing an SSoD policy.",

                 mechanisms to secure SOAP traffic, one message at a
                 time. For typical web services, however, using
                 WS-Security independently for each message is rather
                 inefficient; moreover, it is often important to secure
                 the integrity of a whole session, as well as each
                 message. To these ends, recent specifications provide

                 establishing trust in open systems, in which sensitive
                 interactions may often occur between entities with no
                 prior knowledge of each other. Although, to date
                 several trust negotiation systems have been proposed,
                 none of them fully address the problem of privacy
                 preservation. Today, privacy is one of the major
                 concerns of users when exchanging information through
                 the Web and thus we believe that trust negotiation
                 systems must effectively address privacy issues in
                 order to be widely applicable. For these reasons, in
                 this paper, we investigate privacy in the context of
                 trust negotiations. We propose a set of
                 privacy-preserving features for inclusion in any trust
                 negotiation system, such as the support for the P3P
                 standard, as well as a number of innovative features,
                 such as a novel format for encoding digital credentials
                 specifically designed for preserving privacy. Further,
                 we present a variety of interoperable strategies to

                 network? How long does it take to disinfect
                 a network given particular values of infection rate and
                 virus death rate? What is the single best
                 node to immunize? Answering these questions
                 is essential for devising network-wide strategies to
                 counter viruses. In addition, viral propagation is very
                 similar in principle to the spread of rumors,
                 information, and ``fads,'' implying that the solutions
                 for viral propagation would also offer insights into
                 these other problem settings. We answer these questions
                 by developing a nonlinear dynamical system ( NLDS )
                 that accurately models viral propagation in any
                 arbitrary network, including real and synthesized
                 network graphs. We propose a general epidemic threshold
                 condition for the NLDS system: we prove that the
                 epidemic threshold for a network is exactly the inverse
                 of the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix.
                 Finally, we show that below the epidemic threshold,
                 infections die out at an exponential rate. Our epidemic
                 threshold model subsumes many known thresholds for
                 special-case graphs (e.g., Erd{\"o}s--R{\'e}nyi, BA
                 powerlaw, homogeneous). We demonstrate the predictive
                 power of our model with extensive experiments on real
                 and synthesized graphs, and show that our threshold
                 condition holds for arbitrary graphs. Finally, we show
                 how to utilize our threshold condition for practical
                 uses: It can dictate which nodes to immunize; it can
                 assess the effects of a throttling policy; it can help
                 us design network topologies so that they are more

                 role-activation semantics through role--role
                 relationships. It can be utilized for efficiently and
                 effectively structuring functional roles of an
                 organization having related access-control needs. The
                 focus of this paper is the analysis of hybrid role
                 hierarchies in the context of the generalized temporal
                 role-based access control (GTRBAC) model that allows
                 specification of a comprehensive set of temporal
                 constraints on role, user-role, and role-permission
                 assignments. We introduce the notion of uniquely
                 activable set (UAS) associated with a role hierarchy
                 that indicates the access capabilities of a user
                 resulting from his membership to a role in the
                 hierarchy. Identifying such a role set is essential,
                 while making an authorization decision about whether or
                 not a user should be allowed to activate a particular
                 combination of roles in a single session. We formally
                 show how UAS can be determined for a hybrid hierarchy.
                 Furthermore, within a hybrid hierarchy, various
                 hierarchical relations may be derived between an
                 arbitrary pair of roles. We present a set of inference
                 rules that can be used to generate all the possible
                 derived relations that can be inferred from a specified
                 set of hierarchical relations and show that it is sound
                 and complete. We also present an analysis of hierarchy
                 transformations with respect to role addition,
                 deletion, and partitioning, and show how various cases
                 of these transformations allow the original permission
                 acquisition and role-activation semantics to be
                 managed. The formal results presented here provide a

                 life rely on the secure storage of keys in consumer
                 devices. Protecting these keys from invasive attackers,
                 who open a device to steal its key, is a challenging
                 problem. We propose controlled physical random
                 functions (CPUFs) as an alternative to storing keys and
                 describe the core protocols that are needed to use
                 CPUFs. A physical random functions (PUF) is a physical
                 system with an input and output. The functional
                 relationship between input and output looks like that
                 of a random function. The particular relationship is
                 unique to a specific instance of a PUF, hence, one
                 needs access to a particular PUF instance to evaluate
                 the function it embodies. The cryptographic
                 applications of a PUF are quite limited unless the PUF
                 is combined with an algorithm that limits the ways in
                 which the PUF can be evaluated; this is a CPUF. A major
                 difficulty in using CPUFs is that you can only know a
                 small set of outputs of the PUF---the unknown outputs
                 being unrelated to the known ones. We present protocols
                 that get around this difficulty and allow a chain of
                 trust to be established between the CPUF manufacturer
                 and a party that wishes to interact securely with the

                 servers and in Database Service Providers and the
                 growing interest for different forms of selective data
                 dissemination are different factors that lead to move
                 the access-control from servers to clients. Different
                 data encryption and key dissemination schemes have been
                 proposed to serve this purpose. By compiling the
                 access-control rules into the encryption process, all
                 these methods suffer from a static way of sharing data.
                 With the emergence of hardware security elements on
                 client devices, more dynamic client-based
                 access-control schemes can be devised. This paper
                 proposes a tamper-resistant client-based XML
                 access-right controller supporting flexible and dynamic
                 access-control policies. The access-control engine is
                 embedded in a hardware-secure device and, therefore,
                 must cope with specific hardware resources. This engine
                 benefits from a dedicated index to quickly converge
                 toward the authorized parts of a potentially streaming
                 XML document. Pending situations (i. e. , where data
                 delivery is conditioned by predicates, which apply to
                 values encountered afterward in the document stream)
                 are handled gracefully, skipping, whenever possible the
                 pending elements and reassembling relevant parts when
                 the pending situation is solved. Additional security
                 mechanisms guarantee that (1) the input document is
                 protected from any form of tampering and (2) no
                 forbidden information can be gained by replay attacks
                 on different versions of the XML document and of the
                 access-control rules. Performance measurements on
                 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
                 effectiveness of the approach. Finally, the paper

                 typically choose passwords that are easy to recall,
                 exhibit patterns, and are thus vulnerable to
                 brute-force dictionary attacks. This leads us to ask
                 whether other types of passwords (e. g. , graphical)
                 are also vulnerable to dictionary attack because of
                 users tending to choose memorable passwords. We suggest
                 a method to predict and model a number of such classes
                 for systems where passwords are created solely from a
                 user's memory. We hypothesize that these classes define
                 weak password subspaces suitable for an attack
                 dictionary. For user-drawn graphical passwords, we
                 apply this method with cognitive studies on visual
                 recall. These cognitive studies motivate us to define a
                 set of password complexity factors (e. g. , reflective
                 symmetry and stroke count), which define a set of
                 classes. To better understand the size of these classes
                 and, thus, how weak the password subspaces they define
                 might be, we use the ``Draw-A-Secret'' (DAS) graphical
                 password scheme of Jermyn et al. [1999] as an example.
                 We analyze the size of these classes for DAS under
                 convenient parameter choices and show that they can be
                 combined to define apparently popular subspaces that
                 have bit sizes ranging from 31 to 41---a surprisingly
                 small proportion of the full password space (58 bits).
                 Our results quantitatively support suggestions that
                 user-drawn graphical password systems employ measures,
                 such as graphical password rules or guidelines and

                 attacks. In this work, we examine the impact of several
                 Byzantine attacks performed by individual or colluding
                 attackers. We propose ODSBR, the first on-demand
                 routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks that
                 provides resilience to Byzantine attacks caused by
                 individual or colluding nodes. The protocol uses an
                 adaptive probing technique that detects a malicious
                 link after log n faults have occurred, where n is the
                 length of the path. Problematic links are avoided by
                 using a route discovery mechanism that relies on a new
                 metric that captures adversarial behavior. Our protocol
                 never partitions the network and bounds the amount of
                 damage caused by attackers. We demonstrate through
                 simulations ODSBR's effectiveness in mitigating
                 Byzantine attacks. Our analysis of the impact of these
                 attacks versus the adversary's effort gives insights
                 into their relative strengths, their interaction, and
                 their importance when designing multihop wireless
                 routing protocols.",

  abstract =     "In recent years, trust negotiation has been proposed
                 as a novel authorization solution for use in
                 open-system environments, in which resources are shared
                 across organizational boundaries. Researchers have
                 shown that trust negotiation is indeed a viable
                 solution for these environments by developing a number
                 of policy languages and strategies for trust
                 negotiation that have desirable theoretical properties.
                 Further, existing protocols, such as TLS, have been
                 altered to interact with prototype trust negotiation
                 systems, thereby illustrating the utility of trust
                 negotiation. Unfortunately, modifying existing
                 protocols is often a time-consuming and bureaucratic
                 process that can hinder the adoption of this promising
                 technology. \par

                 In this paper, we present Traust, a third-party
                 authorization service that leverages the strengths of
                 existing prototype trust negotiation systems. Traust
                 acts as an authorization broker that issues access
                 tokens for resources in an open system after entities
                 use trust negotiation to satisfy the appropriate
                 resource access policies. The Traust architecture was
                 designed to allow Traust to be integrated either
                 directly with newer trust-aware applications or
                 indirectly with existing legacy applications; this
                 flexibility paves the way for the incremental adoption
                 of trust negotiation technologies without requiring
                 widespread software or protocol upgrades. We discuss
                 the design and implementation of Traust, the
                 communication protocol used by the Traust system, and
                 its performance. We also discuss our experiences using
                 Traust to broker access to legacy resources, our
                 proposal for a Traust-aware version of the GridFTP
                 protocol, and Traust's resilience to attack.",

                 and scalable access to distributed computing
                 capabilities and enable seamless resource sharing
                 between users and platforms. This heterogeneous
                 distribution of resources and the various modes of
                 collaborations that exist between users, virtual
                 organizations, and resource providers require scalable,
                 flexible, and fine-grained access control to protect
                 both individual and shared computing resources. In this
                 article we propose a usage control (UCON) based
                 security framework for collaborative applications, by
                 following a layered approach with policy, enforcement,
                 and implementation models, called the PEI framework. In
                 the policy model layer, UCON policies are specified
                 with predicates on subject and object attributes, along
                 with system attributes as conditional constraints and
                 user actions as obligations. General attributes include
                 not only persistent attributes such as role and group
                 memberships but also mutable usage attributes of
                 subjects and objects. Conditions in UCON can be used to
                 support context-based authorizations in ad hoc
                 collaborations. In the enforcement model layer, our
                 novel framework uses a hybrid approach for subject
                 attribute acquisition with both push and pull modes. By
                 leveraging attribute propagations between a centralized
                 attribute repository and distributed policy decision
                 points, our architecture supports decision continuity
                 and attribute mutability of the UCON policy model, as
                 well as obligation evaluations during policy
                 enforcement. As a proof-of-concept, we implement a
                 prototype system based on our proposed architecture and
                 conduct experimental studies to demonstrate the
                 feasibility and performance of our approach.",

                 extremely beneficial to employees, but can be a burden
                 to network security personnel. This burden is magnified
                 by the threat of inexpensive wireless access points
                 being installed in a network without the knowledge of

                 analyzed the success of such attacks under various
                 assumptions. Here, we evaluate the effects of these
                 assumptions more closely. First, we analyze the Onion
                 Routing-based model used in prior work in which a fixed
                 set of nodes remains in the system indefinitely. We
                 show that for this model, by removing the assumption of
                 uniformly random selection of nodes for placement in
                 the path, initiators can greatly improve their
                 anonymity. Second, we show by simulation that attack
                 times are significantly lower in practice than bounds
                 given by analytical results from prior work. Third, we
                 analyze the effects of a dynamic membership model, in
                 which nodes are allowed to join and leave the system;
                 we show that all known defenses fail more quickly when
                 the assumption of a static node set is relaxed. Fourth,
                 intersection attacks against peer-to-peer systems are
                 shown to be an additional danger, either on their own
                 or in conjunction with the predecessor attack. Finally,
                 we address the question of whether the regular
                 communication patterns required by the attacks exist in
                 real traffic. We collected and analyzed the Web
                 requests of users to determine the extent to which
                 basic patterns can be found. We show that, for our

                 provably-secure constructions of timed-release
                 encryption: a generic scheme based on any
                 identity-based encryption scheme, and two more
                 efficient schemes based on the existence of
                 cryptographically admissible bilinear mappings. The
                 first of these is essentially as efficient as the
                 Boneh--Franklin Identity-Based encryption scheme, and is
                 provably secure and authenticated in the random oracle
                 model; the final scheme is not authenticated but is
                 provably secure in the standard model (i. e. , without

                 Once a node's cryptographic key is compromised, an
                 attacker may completely impersonate it and introduce
                 arbitrary false information into the network. Basic
                 cryptographic mechanisms are often not effective in
                 this situation. Most techniques to address this problem
                 focus on detecting and tolerating false information
                 introduced by compromised nodes. They cannot pinpoint

                 algorithm assumes that compromised nodes may collude at
                 will. We show that our algorithm is optimal in the

                 compromised nodes without introducing false positives.

                 analysis of the connectivity and security properties of
                 sensor networks that make use of the random
                 predistribution of keys. We also show how to set the
                 parameters---pool and key ring size---in such a way
                 that the network is not only connected with high
                 probability via secure links but also provably
                 resilient, in the following sense: We formally show
                 that any adversary that captures sensors at random with
                 the aim of compromising a constant fraction of the
                 secure links must capture at least a constant fraction
                 of the nodes of the network. In the context of wireless
                 sensor networks where random predistribution of keys is

                 precise proof, with a clear indication of parameter

                 components, compromising all the links between them,

  abstract =     "Security in wireless sensor networks has become
                 important as they are being developed and deployed for
                 an increasing number of applications. The severe
                 resource constraints in each sensor make it very
                 challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover,
                 sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended
                 environments and hence are susceptible to various
                 attacks, including node capture, physical tampering,
                 and manipulation of the sensor program. Park and Shin
                 [2005] proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that
                 verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor
                 device, called the program integrity verification
                 (PIV), in which sensors authenticate PIV servers
                 (PIVSs) using centralized and trusted third-party
                 entities, such as authentication servers (ASs). This
                 article presents a distributed authentication protocol
                 of PIVSs (DAPP) without requiring the commonly used
                 ASs. DAPP uses the Blundo scheme [Blundo et al. 1992]
                 for sensors and PIVSs to establish pairwise keys and
                 for PIVSs to authenticate one another. We also present
                 a protocol for PIVSs to cooperatively detect and revoke
                 malicious PIVSs in the network. We implement and
                 evaluate both DAPP and PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops,
                 showing that DAPP reduces the sensors' communication
                 traffic in the network by more than 90\% and
                 the energy consumption on each sensor by up to
                 85\%, as compared to the case of using a
                 centralized AS for authenticating PIVSs. We also
                 analyze the security of DAPP under various attack
                 models, demonstrating its capability in dealing with
                 diverse types of attacks.",

                 for 25 years and have benefited from several
                 improvements since the original work of Hellman. The
                 ensuing variants definitely improve the original
                 trade-off but their real impact has never been
                 evaluated in practice. We fill this lack by analyzing
                 the {\em perfect\/} form of classic tables,
                 distinguished point-based tables, and rainbow tables.
                 We especially provide a thorough analysis of the latter
                 variant, whose performances have never been formally
                 calculated yet. Our analysis leads to the concept of a
                 {\em characteristic\/} that enables to measure the
                 intrinsic quality of a trade-off. We finally introduce
                 a new technique based on {\em checkpoints\/} that still
                 reduces the cryptanalysis time by ruling out false
                 alarms probabilistically. Our analysis yields the exact
                 gain of this approach and establishes its efficiency

  abstract =     "Hop-by-hop data aggregation is a very important
                 technique for reducing the communication overhead and
                 energy expenditure of sensor nodes during the process
                 of data collection in a sensor network. However,
                 because individual sensor readings are lost in the
                 per-hop aggregation process, compromised nodes in the
                 network may forge false values as the aggregation
                 results of other nodes, tricking the base station into
                 accepting spurious aggregation results. Here a
                 fundamental challenge is how can the base station
                 obtain a good approximation of the fusion result when a
                 fraction of sensor nodes are compromised?\par

                 To answer this challenge, we propose SDAP, a Secure
                 Hop-by-hop Data Aggregation Protocol for sensor
                 networks. SDAP is a general-purpose secure data
                 aggregation protocol applicable to multiple aggregation
                 functions. The design of SDAP is based on the
                 principles of {\em divide-and-conquer\/} and {\em
                 commit-and-attest}. First, SDAP uses a novel
                 probabilistic grouping technique to dynamically
                 partition the nodes in a tree topology into multiple
                 logical groups (subtrees) of similar sizes. A
                 commitment-based hop-by-hop aggregation is performed in
                 each group to generate a group aggregate. The base
                 station then identifies the suspicious groups based on
                 the set of group aggregates. Finally, each group under
                 suspect participates in an attestation process to prove
                 the correctness of its group aggregate. The aggregate
                 by the base station is calculated over all the group
                 aggregates that are either normal or have passed the
                 attestation procedure. Extensive analysis and
                 simulations show that SDAP can achieve the level of
                 efficiency close to an ordinary hop-by-hop aggregation
                 protocol while providing high assurance on the
                 trustworthiness of the aggregation result. Last,
                 prototype implementation on top of TinyOS shows that
                 our scheme is practical on current generation sensor
                 nodes such as Mica2 motes.",

  abstract =     "The widespread deployment of wireless networks and hot
                 spots that employ the IEEE 802.11 technology has forced
                 network designers to put emphasis on the importance of
                 ensuring efficient and fair use of network resources.
                 In this work we propose a novel framework for detection
                 of intelligent adaptive adversaries in the IEEE 802.11
                 MAC by addressing the problem of detection of the
                 worst-case scenario attacks. Utilizing the nature of
                 this protocol we employ sequential detection methods
                 for detecting greedy behavior and illustrate their
                 performance for detection of least favorable attacks.
                 By using robust statistics in our problem formulation,
                 we attempt to utilize the precision given by parametric
                 tests, while avoiding the specification of the
                 adversarial distribution. This approach establishes the
                 lowest performance bound of a given Intrusion Detection
                 System (IDS) in terms of detection delay and is
                 applicable in online detection systems where users who
                 pay for their services want to obtain the information
                 about the best and the worst case scenarios and
                 performance bounds of the system. This framework is
                 meaningful for studying misbehavior due to the fact
                 that it does not focus on specific adversarial
                 strategies and therefore is applicable to a wide class
                 of adversarial strategies.",

  abstract =     "An intrusion detection system plays an important role
                 in a firm's overall security protection. Its main
                 purpose is to identify potentially intrusive events and
                 alert the security personnel to the danger. A typical
                 intrusion detection system, however, is known to be
                 imperfect in detection of intrusive events, resulting
                 in high false-alarm rates. Nevertheless, current
                 intrusion detection models unreasonably assume that
                 upon alerts raised by a system, an information security
                 officer responds to all alarms without any delay and
                 avoids damages of hostile activities. This assumption
                 of responding to all alarms with no time lag is often
                 impracticable. As a result, the benefit of an intrusion
                 detection system can be overestimated by current
                 intrusion detection models. In this article, we extend
                 previous models by including an information security
                 officer's alarm inspection under a constraint as a part
                 of the process in determining the optimal intrusion
                 detection policy. Given a potentially hostile
                 environment for a firm, in which the intrusion rates
                 and costs associated with intrusion and security
                 officers' inspection can be estimated, we outline a
                 framework to establish the optimal operating points for
                 intrusion detection systems under security officers'
                 inspection constraint. The optimal solution to the
                 model will provide not only a basis of better
                 evaluation of intrusion detection systems but also
                 useful insights into operations of intrusion detection
                 systems. The firm can estimate expected benefits for
                 running intrusion detection systems and establish a
                 basis for increase in security personnel to relax
                 security officers' inspection constraint.",

                 locations to function correctly. Despite the recent
                 advances, location discovery for sensor networks in
                 {\em hostile environments\/} has been mostly
                 overlooked. Most of the existing localization protocols
                 for sensor networks are vulnerable in hostile
                 environments. The security of location discovery can
                 certainly be enhanced by authentication. However, the
                 possible node compromises and the fact that location
                 determination uses certain physical features (e.g.,
                 received signal strength) of radio signals make
                 authentication not as effective as in traditional
                 security applications. This article presents two
                 methods to tolerate malicious attacks against
                 range-based location discovery in sensor networks. The
                 first method filters out malicious beacon signals on
                 the basis of the ``consistency'' among multiple beacon
                 signals, while the second method tolerates malicious
                 beacon signals by adopting an iteratively refined
                 voting scheme. Both methods can survive malicious
                 attacks even if the attacks bypass authentication,
                 provided that the benign beacon signals constitute the
                 majority of the beacon signals. This article also

                 restricted in the sense that it is based on one type of
                 ascribed status, an assignment of a user to a role. In
                 this article, we introduce the status-based access
                 control (SBAC) model for distributed access control.
                 The SBAC model (or family of models) is based on the
                 notion of users having an action status as well as an
                 ascribed status. A user's action status is established,
                 in part, from a history of events that relate to the
                 user; this history enables changing access policy
                 requirements to be naturally accommodated. The approach
                 can be implemented as an autonomous agent that reasons
                 about the events, actions, and a history (of events and
                 actions), which relates to a requester for access to
                 resources, in order to decide whether the requester is
                 permitted the access sought. We define a number of
                 algebras for composing SBAC policies, algebras that
                 exploit the language that we introduce for SBAC policy
                 representation: identification-based logic programs.
                 The SBAC model is richer than RBAC models and the
                 policies that can be represented in our approach are
                 more expressive than the policies admitted by a number
                 of monotonic languages that have been hitherto
                 described for representing distributed access control
                 requirements. Our algebras generalize existing algebras
                 that have been defined for access policy composition.
                 We also describe an approach for the efficient
                 implementation of SBAC policies.",

  abstract =     "Secure bootstrapping of mobile ad hoc networks
                 (MANETs) is a challenging problem in scenarios in which
                 network users (or nodes) do not share trust
                 relationships prior to the network deployment. In
                 recent years, a number of schemes have been proposed to
                 solve this problem, assuming either no or limited trust
                 between the nodes prior to their deployment. Despite
                 numerous proposals, there is no common understanding of
                 the proposed schemes and of the trade-offs that they
                 provide. This has consequences for both researchers and
                 practitioners, who do not have a clear idea how to
                 compare the schemes and how to select a scheme for a
                 given application. In this article, we present a
                 framework that helps in understanding and comparing
                 schemes for secure bootstrapping of MANETs. The
                 framework is general because it is policy-neutral and
                 can accommodate many existing bootstrapping schemes.
                 The proposed framework can equally serve as a good
                 basis for the development of new MANET bootstrapping
                 schemes; we show how the development of the framework
                 leads to two new (classes of) distributed bootstrapping
                 schemes. Within the framework, we not only investigate
                 and characterize the properties of the relevant
                 bootstrapping schemes, but also give methods for
                 practitioners to select the relevant system parameters
                 in the Random Walk and the (Restricted) Random Waypoint

                 signature. First, we introduce a new primitive that we
                 call {\em ordered multisignature\/} (OMS) scheme, which
                 allows signers to attest to a common message as well as
                 the order in which they signed. Our OMS construction
                 substantially improves computational efficiency and
                 scalability over any existing scheme with suitable

                 can attest to different messages and signature
                 verification does not require knowledge of traditional

                 Specifically, Bob values each credential with a certain
                 number of points, and requires a minimum total
                 threshold of points before granting Alice access to a
                 resource. In turn, Alice values each of her credentials
                 with a privacy score that indicates her degree of
                 reluctance to reveal that credential. Bob's valuation
                 of credentials and his threshold are private. Alice's
                 privacy-valuation of her credentials is also private.
                 Alice wants to find a subset of her credentials that
                 achieves Bob's required threshold for access, yet is of

                 proving, networked entities cooperate to form proofs of
                 authorization that are justified by collections of
                 certified attribute credentials. These attributes may
                 be obtained through interactions with any number of
                 external entities and are collected and validated over
                 an extended period of time. Although these collections
                 of credentials in some ways resemble partial system
                 snapshots, current trust negotiation and distributed
                 proving systems lack the notion of a consistent global
                 state in which the satisfaction of authorization
                 policies should be checked. In this article, we argue
                 that unlike the notions of consistency studied in other
                 areas of distributed computing, the level of
                 consistency required during policy evaluation is
                 predicated solely upon the security requirements of the
                 policy evaluator. As such, there is little incentive
                 for entities to participate in complicated consistency
                 preservation schemes like those used in distributed
                 computing, distributed databases, and distributed
                 shared memory. We go on to show that the most intuitive
                 notion of consistency fails to provide basic safety
                 guarantees under certain circumstances and then propose
                 several more refined notions of consistency that
                 provide stronger safety guarantees. We provide
                 algorithms that allow each of these refined notions of
                 consistency to be attained in practice with minimal
                 overheads and formally prove several security and
                 privacy properties of these algorithms. Lastly, we
                 explore the notion of strategic design trade-offs in
                 the consistency enforcement algorithm space and propose
                 several modifications to the core algorithms presented
                 in this article. These modifications enhance the
                 privacy-preservation or completeness properties of

  abstract =     "This article presents EXE, an effective bug-finding
                 tool that automatically generates inputs that crash
                 real code. Instead of running code on manually or
                 randomly constructed input, EXE runs it on symbolic
                 input initially allowed to be anything. As checked code
                 runs, EXE tracks the constraints on each symbolic
                 (i.e., input-derived) memory location. If a statement
                 uses a symbolic value, EXE does not run it, but instead
                 adds it as an input-constraint; all other statements
                 run as usual. If code conditionally checks a symbolic
                 expression, EXE forks execution, constraining the
                 expression to be true on the true branch and false on
                 the other. Because EXE reasons about all possible
                 values on a path, it has much more power than a
                 traditional runtime tool: (1) it can force execution
                 down any feasible program path and (2) at dangerous
                 operations (e.g., a pointer dereference), it detects if
                 the current path constraints allow {\em any\/} value
                 that causes a bug. When a path terminates or hits a
                 bug, EXE automatically generates a test case by solving
                 the current path constraints to find concrete values
                 using its own co-designed constraint solver, STP.
                 Because EXE's constraints have no approximations,
                 feeding this concrete input to an uninstrumented
                 version of the checked code will cause it to follow the
                 same path and hit the same bug (assuming deterministic
                 code).\par

                 EXE works well on real code, finding bugs along with
                 inputs that trigger them in: the BSD and Linux packet
                 filter implementations, the dhcpd DHCP server, the pcre
                 regular expression library, and three Linux file

  abstract =     "In biology, a {\em vaccine\/} is a weakened strain of
                 a virus or bacterium that is intentionally injected
                 into the body for the purpose of stimulating antibody
                 production. Inspired by this idea, we propose a {\em
                 packet vaccine\/} mechanism that randomizes
                 address-like strings in packet payloads to carry out
                 fast exploit detection and signature generation. An
                 exploit with a randomized jump address behaves like a
                 vaccine: it will likely cause an exception in a
                 vulnerable program's process when attempting to hijack
                 the control flow, and thereby expose itself. Taking
                 that exploit as a template, our signature generator
                 creates a set of new vaccines to probe the program in
                 an attempt to uncover the necessary conditions for the
                 exploit to happen. A signature is built upon these
                 conditions to shield the underlying vulnerability from
                 further attacks. In this way, packet vaccine detects
                 exploits and generates signatures in a black-box
                 fashion, that is, not relying on the knowledge of a
                 vulnerable program's source and binary code. Therefore,
                 it even works on the commodity software obfuscated for
                 the purpose of copyright protection. In addition, since
                 our approach avoids the expense of tracking the
                 program's execution flow, it performs almost as fast as
                 a normal run of the program and is capable of
                 generating a signature of high quality within seconds
                 or even subseconds. We present the design of the packet
                 vaccine mechanism and an example of its application. We

                 compromised PCs is a widely-used trick to conceal real
                 spam sources and reduce spamming cost in the
                 underground e-mail spam industry. Spammers have plagued
                 the Internet by exploiting a large number of spam
                 proxies. The facility of breaking spam laundering and
                 deterring spamming activities close to their sources,
                 which would greatly benefit not only e-mail users but
                 also victim ISPs, is in great demand but still missing.
                 In this article, we reveal one salient characteristic
                 of proxy-based spamming activities, namely packet
                 symmetry, by analyzing protocol semantics and timing
                 causality. Based on the packet symmetry exhibited in
                 spam laundering, we propose a simple and effective
                 technique, DBSpam, to online detect and break spam
                 laundering activities inside a customer network.
                 Monitoring the bidirectional traffic passing through a
                 network gateway, DBSpam utilizes a simple statistical
                 method, Sequential Probability Ratio Test, to detect
                 the occurrence of spam laundering in a timely manner.
                 To balance the goals of promptness and accuracy, we
                 introduce a noise-reduction technique in DBSpam, after
                 which the laundering path can be identified more
                 accurately. Then DBSpam activates its spam suppressing
                 mechanism to break the spam laundering. We implement a
                 prototype of DBSpam based on {\em libpcap}, and
                 validate its efficacy on spam detection and suppression
                 through both theoretical analyses and trace-based
                 experiments.",

                 a {\em safe execution environment (SEE)\/} that enables
                 users to ``try out'' new software (or configuration
                 changes to existing software) without the fear of
                 damaging the system in any manner. A key property of
                 our SEE is that it faithfully reproduces the behavior
                 of applications, as if they were running natively on
                 the underlying (host) operating system. This is
                 accomplished via {\em one-way isolation\/}: processes
                 running within the SEE are given read-access to the
                 environment provided by the host OS, but their write
                 operations are prevented from escaping outside the SEE.
                 As a result, SEE processes cannot impact the behavior
                 of host OS processes, or the integrity of data on the
                 host OS. SEEs support a wide range of tasks, including:
                 study of malicious code, controlled execution of
                 untrusted software, experimentation with software
                 configuration changes, testing of software patches, and
                 so on. It provides a convenient way for users to
                 inspect system changes made within the SEE. If these
                 changes are not accepted, they can be rolled back at
                 the click of a button. Otherwise, the changes can be
                 committed so as to become visible outside the SEE. We
                 provide consistency criteria that ensure semantic
                 consistency of the committed results. We develop two
                 different implementation approaches, one in {\em
                 user-land\/} and the other in the {\em OS kernel}, for
                 realizing a safe-execution environment. Our
                 implementation results show that most software,
                 including fairly complex server and client
                 applications, can run successfully within our SEEs. It
                 introduces low performance overheads, typically below

  abstract =     "A system for private stream searching, introduced by
                 Ostrovsky and Skeith, allows a client to provide an
                 untrusted server with an encrypted search query. The
                 server uses the query on a stream of documents and
                 returns the matching documents to the client while
                 learning nothing about the nature of the query. We
                 present a new scheme for conducting private keyword
                 search on streaming data which requires $O(m)$ server
                 to client communication complexity to return the
                 content of the matching documents, where $m$ is an
                 upper bound on the size of the documents. The required
                 storage on the server conducting the search is also
                 $O(m)$. The previous best scheme for private stream
                 searching was shown to have $O(m \log m)$ communication
                 and storage complexity. Our solution employs a novel
                 construction in which the user reconstructs the
                 matching files by solving a system of linear equations.
                 This allows the matching documents to be stored in a
                 compact buffer rather than relying on redundancies to
                 avoid collisions in the storage buffer as in previous
                 work. This technique requires a small amount of
                 metadata to be returned in addition to the documents;
                 for this the original scheme of Ostrovsky and Skeith
                 may be employed with $O(m \log m)$ communication and
                 storage complexity. We also present an alternative
                 method for returning the necessary metadata based on a
                 unique encrypted Bloom filter construction. This method
                 requires $O(m \log(t / m))$ communication and storage
                 complexity, where $t$ is the number of documents in the

                 complete depending on the data being processed. These
                 timing differences can sometimes disclose confidential
                 information. Indeed, researchers have been able to
                 reconstruct an RSA private key purely by querying an
                 SSL Web server and timing the results. Our work
                 analyzes the limits of attacks based on accurately
                 measuring network response times and jitter over a
                 local network and across the Internet. We present the
                 design of filters to significantly reduce the effects
                 of jitter, allowing an attacker to measure events with
                 15--100$\mu$s accuracy across the Internet, and as good
                 as 100ns over a local network. Notably,
                 security-related algorithms on Web servers and other

  abstract =     "Hierarchies arise in the context of access control
                 whenever the user population can be modeled as a set of
                 partially ordered classes (represented as a directed
                 graph). A user with access privileges for a class
                 obtains access to objects stored at that class and all
                 descendant classes in the hierarchy. The problem of key
                 management for such hierarchies then consists of
                 assigning a key to each class in the hierarchy so that
                 keys for descendant classes can be obtained via
                 efficient key derivation.\par

                 We propose a solution to this problem with the
                 following properties: (1) the space complexity of the
                 public information is the same as that of storing the
                 hierarchy; (2) the private information at a class
                 consists of a single key associated with that class;
                 (3) updates (i.e., revocations and additions) are
                 handled {\em locally\/} in the hierarchy; (4) the
                 scheme is provably secure against collusion; and (5)
                 each node can derive the key of any of its descendant
                 with a number of symmetric-key operations bounded by
                 the length of the path between the nodes. Whereas many
                 previous schemes had some of these properties, ours is
                 the first that satisfies all of them. The security of
                 our scheme is based on pseudorandom functions, without
                 reliance on the Random Oracle Model.\par

                 Another substantial contribution of this work is that
                 we are able to lower the key derivation time at the
                 expense of modestly increasing the public storage
                 associated with the hierarchy. Insertion of additional,
                 so-called shortcut, edges, allows to lower the key
                 derivation to a small constant number of steps for
                 graphs that are total orders and trees by increasing
                 the total number of edges by a small asymptotic factor
                 such as $O(\log^* n)$ for an $n$-node hierarchy. For
                 more general access hierarchies of dimension $d$, we
                 use a technique that consists of adding dummy nodes and
                 dimension reduction. The key derivation work for such
                 graphs is then linear in $d$ and the increase in the
                 number of edges is by the factor $O(\log^{d - 1} n)$
                 compared to the one-dimensional case.\par

                 Finally, by making simple modifications to our scheme,
                 we show how to handle extensions proposed by Crampton
                 [2003] of the standard hierarchies to ``limited depth''
                 and reverse inheritance.",

                 securely is to monitor programs at run time and check
                 that they dynamically adhere to constraints specified
                 by a security policy. Whenever a program monitor
                 detects that untrusted software is attempting to

                 framework for analyzing policy enforcement: we
                 precisely define policies, monitors, and enforcement.
                 This framework allows us to prove that monitors enforce
                 an interesting set of policies that we call the
                 infinite renewal properties. We show how to construct a
                 program monitor that provably enforces any reasonable
                 infinite renewal property. We also show that the set of
                 infinite renewal properties includes some nonsafety
                 policies, that is, that monitors can enforce some
                 nonsafety (including some purely liveness) policies.

  abstract =     "We introduce the notion of resiliency policies in the
                 context of access control systems. Such policies
                 require an access control system to be resilient to the
                 absence of users. An example resiliency policy requires
                 that upon removal of any $s$ users, there should still
                 exist $d$ disjoint sets of users such that the users in
                 each set together possess certain permissions of
                 interest. Such a policy ensures that even when
                 emergency situations cause some users to be absent,
                 there still exist independent teams of users that have
                 the permissions necessary for carrying out critical
                 tasks. The Resiliency Checking Problem determines
                 whether an access control state satisfies a given
                 resiliency policy. We show that the general case of the
                 problem and several subcases are intractable (NP
                 hard), and identify two subcases that are solvable in
                 linear time. For the intractable cases, we also
                 identify the complexity class in the polynomial
                 hierarchy to which these problems belong. We discuss
                 the design and evaluation of an algorithm that can
                 efficiently solve instances of nontrivial sizes that
                 belong to the intractable cases of the
                 problem. Furthermore, we study the consistency problem
                 between resiliency policies and static separation of
                 duty policies. Finally, we combine the notions of
                 resiliency and separation of duty to introduce the
                 resilient separation of duty policy, which is useful in
                 situations where both fault-tolerance and

  abstract =     "The PseudoRandom Number Generator (PRNG) used by the
                 Windows operating system is the most commonly used
                 PRNG. The pseudorandomness of the output of this
                 generator is crucial for the security of almost any
                 application running in Windows. Nevertheless, its exact
                 algorithm was never published.\par

                 We examined the binary code of a distribution of
                 Windows 2000. This investigation was done without any
                 help from Microsoft.We reconstructed the algorithm used
                 by the pseudorandom number generator (namely, the
                 function CryptGenRandom). We analyzed the security of
                 the algorithm and found a nontrivial attack: Given the
                 internal state of the generator, the previous state can
                 be computed in 223 steps. This attack on forward
                 security demonstrates that the design of the generator
                 is flawed, since it is well known how to prevent such
                 attacks. After our analysis was published, Microsoft
                 acknowledged that Windows XP is vulnerable to the same
                 attack.\par

                 We also analyzed the way in which the generator is used
                 by the operating system and found that it amplifies the
                 effect of the attack: The generator is run in user mode
                 rather than in kernel mode; therefore, it is easy to
                 access its state even without administrator privileges.
                 The initial values of part of the state of the
                 generator are not set explicitly, but rather are
                 defined by whatever values are present on the stack
                 when the generator is called. Furthermore, each process
                 runs a different copy of the generator, and the state
                 of the generator is refreshed with system-generated
                 entropy only after generating 128KB of output for the
                 process running it. The result of combining this
                 observation with our attack is that learning a single
                 state may reveal 128KB of the past and future output of
                 the generator.\par

                 The implication of these findings is that a buffer
                 overflow attack or a similar attack can be used to
                 learn a single state of the generator, which can then
                 be used to predict all random values, such as SSL keys,
                 used by a process in all its past and future
                 operations. This attack is more severe and more
                 efficient than known attacks in which an attack",

                 is a challenging task, especially in environments with
                 complex and changing authorization requirements. A
                 number of authorization logics have been proposed that
                 aim at simplifying access control by factoring the
                 authorization policy out of the hard-coded resource
                 guard. However, many policies require the authorization
                 state to be updated after a granted access request, for
                 example, to reflect the fact that a user has activated
                 or deactivated a role. Current authorization languages
                 cannot express such state modifications; these still
                 have to be hard-coded into the resource guard. We
                 present a logic for specifying policies where access
                 requests can have effects on the authorization state.
                 The logic is semantically defined by a mapping to
                 Transaction Logic. Using this approach, updates to the
                 state are factored out of the resource guard, thus
                 enhancing maintainability and facilitating more
                 expressive policies that take the history of access
                 requests into account. We also present a sound and
                 complete proof system for reasoning about sequences of
                 access requests. This gives rise to a goal-oriented
                 algorithm for finding minimal sequences that lead to a
                 specified target authorization state.",

                 enforcing security for multithreaded programs. Thanks

  abstract =     "The impact of privacy requirements in the development
                 of modern applications is increasing very quickly. Many
                 commercial and legal regulations are driving the need
                 to develop reliable solutions for protecting sensitive
                 information whenever it is stored, processed, or
                 communicated to external parties. To this purpose,
                 encryption techniques are currently used in many
                 scenarios where data protection is required since they
                 provide a layer of protection against the disclosure of
                 personal information, which safeguards companies from
                 the costs that may arise from exposing their data to
                 privacy breaches. However, dealing with encrypted data
                 may make query processing more expensive.\par

                 In this article, we address these issues by proposing a
                 solution to enforce the privacy of data collections
                 that combines data fragmentation with encryption. We
                 model privacy requirements as confidentiality
                 constraints expressing the sensitivity of attributes
                 and their associations. We then use encryption as an
                 underlying (conveniently available) measure for making
                 data unintelligible while exploiting fragmentation as a
                 way to break sensitive associations among attributes.
                 We formalize the problem of minimizing the impact of
                 fragmentation in terms of number of fragments and their
                 affinity and present two heuristic algorithms for
                 solving such problems. We also discuss experimental
                 results, comparing the solutions returned by our
                 heuristics with respect to optimal solutions, which
                 show that the heuristics, while guaranteeing a
                 polynomial-time computation cost are able to retrieve
                 solutions close to optimum.",

                 framework supporting a privacy-aware access control
                 mechanism, that is, a mechanism tailored to enforce
                 access control to data containing personally
                 identifiable information and, as such, privacy
                 sensitive. The key component of the framework is a
                 family of models (P-RBAC) that extend the well-known
                 RBAC model in order to provide full support for
                 expressing highly complex privacy-related policies,
                 taking into account features like purposes and
                 obligations. We formally define the notion of
                 privacy-aware permissions and the notion of conflicting
                 permission assignments in P-RBAC, together with
                 efficient conflict-checking algorithms. The framework
                 also includes a flexible authoring tool, based on the
                 use of the SPARCLE system, supporting the high-level
                 specification of P-RBAC permissions. SPARCLE supports
                 the use of natural language for authoring policies and
                 is able to automatically generate P-RBAC permissions
                 from these natural language specifications. In the

                 systems that fail to sample a consistent snapshot of
                 the underlying system during policy evaluation are
                 vulnerable to a number of attacks. Unfortunately, the
                 consistency enforcement solutions presented in previous
                 work were designed for systems in which only
                 CA-certified evidence is used during the
                 decision-making process, all of which is available to
                 the decision-making node at runtime. In this article,
                 we generalize previous results and present light-weight
                 mechanisms through which consistency constraints can be
                 enforced in proof systems in which the full details of
                 a proof may be unavailable to the querier due to
                 information release policies, and the existence of
                 certificate authorities for certifying evidence is
                 unlikely; these types of distributed proof systems are
                 likely candidates for use in pervasive computing and

                 to one such distributed proof system that enable three
                 types of consistency constraints to be enforced while
                 still respecting the same confidentiality and integrity
                 policies as the original proof system. We then discuss
                 how these techniques can be adapted and applied to
                 other, less restrictive, distributed proof systems.
                 Further, we detail a performance analysis that

                 recently added a multilevel security (MLS) model which
                 is able to express a fine granularity of control over a
                 subject's access rights. The problem is that the
                 richness of the SELinux MLS model makes it impractical
                 to manually evaluate that a given policy meets certain
                 specific properties. To address this issue, we have
                 modeled the SELinux MLS model, using a logical
                 specification and implemented that specification in the
                 Prolog language. Furthermore, we have developed some

                 recognized as one of the most important and challenging
                 tasks in implementing role-based access control. A key
                 problem related to this is the notion of
                 goodness/interestingness --- when is a role
                 good/interesting? In this article, we define the {\em
                 Role Mining Problem\/} (RMP) as the problem of
                 discovering an optimal set of roles from existing user
                 permissions. The main contribution of this article is
                 to formally define RMP and analyze its theoretical
                 bounds. In addition to the above basic RMP, we
                 introduce two different variations of the RMP, called
                 the {\em {\delta}-Approx RMP\/} and the {\em
                 minimal-noise RMP\/} that have pragmatic implications.
                 We reduce the known ``Set Basis Problem'' to RMP to
                 show that RMP is an NP-complete problem. An important
                 contribution of this article is also to show the
                 relation of the RMP to several problems already
                 identified in the data mining and data analysis
                 literature. By showing that the RMP is in essence
                 reducible to these known problems, we can directly
                 borrow the existing implementation solutions and guide
                 further research in this direction. We also develop a
                 heuristic solution based on the previously proposed

                 of any computational system, it is only recently that
                 mechanisms to guard against unauthorized access to
                 streaming data have started to be investigated. To cope
                 with this lack, in this article, we propose a general
                 framework to protect streaming data, which is, as much
                 as possible, independent from the target stream engine.
                 Differently from RDBMSs, up to now a standard query
                 language for data streams has not yet emerged and this
                 makes the development of a general solution to access
                 control enforcement more difficult. The framework we
                 propose in this article is based on an expressive
                 role-based access control model proposed by us. It
                 exploits a query rewriting mechanism, which rewrites
                 user queries in such a way that they do not return
                 tuples/attributes that should not be accessed according
                 to the specified access control policies. Furthermore,
                 the framework contains a deployment module able to
                 translate the rewritten query in such a way that it can
                 be executed by different stream engines, therefore,
                 overcoming the lack of standardization. In the article,
                 besides presenting all the components of our framework,
                 we prove the correctness and completeness of the query
                 rewriting algorithm, and we present some experiments

                 adopted, its security implications are not yet fully
                 understood. Since VoIP calls may traverse untrusted
                 networks, packets should be encrypted to ensure
                 confidentiality. However, we show that it is possible
                 to identify the phrases spoken within encrypted VoIP
                 calls when the audio is encoded using variable bit rate
                 codecs. To do so, we train a hidden Markov model using
                 only knowledge of the phonetic pronunciations of words,
                 such as those provided by a dictionary, and search
                 packet sequences for instances of specified phrases.
                 Our approach does not require examples of the speaker's
                 voice, or even example recordings of the words that
                 make up the target phrase. We evaluate our techniques
                 on a standard speech recognition corpus containing over
                 2,000 phonetically rich phrases spoken by 630 distinct

                 results indicate that we can identify phrases within
                 encrypted calls with an average accuracy of 50\%, and
                 with accuracy greater than 90\% for some phrases.
                 Clearly, such an attack calls into question the
                 efficacy of current VoIP encryption standards. In
                 addition, we examine the impact of various features of
                 the underlying audio on our performance and discuss

  abstract =     "The use of privacy-enhancing cryptographic protocols,
                 such as anonymous credentials and oblivious transfer,
                 could have a detrimental effect on the ability of
                 providers to effectively implement access controls on
                 their content. In this article, we propose a stateful
                 anonymous credential system that allows the provider to
                 implement nontrivial, real-world access controls on
                 oblivious protocols conducted with anonymous users. Our
                 system models the behavior of users as a state machine
                 and embeds that state within an anonymous credential to
                 restrict access to resources based on the state
                 information. The use of state machine models of user
                 behavior allows the provider to restrict the users'
                 actions according to a wide variety of access control
                 models without learning anything about the users'
                 identities or actions.",

  abstract =     "We introduce a model for provable data possession
                 (PDP) that can be used for remote data checking: A
                 client that has stored data at an untrusted server can
                 verify that the server possesses the original data
                 without retrieving it. The model generates
                 probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random
                 sets of blocks from the server, which drastically
                 reduces I/O costs. The client maintains a constant
                 amount of metadata to verify the proof. The
                 challenge/response protocol transmits a small, constant
                 amount of data, which minimizes network communication.
                 Thus, the PDP model for remote data checking is
                 lightweight and supports large data sets in distributed

                 cryptography has received considerable attention in
                 recent years and the security of such enforcement
                 schemes is increasingly well understood. Recent work in
                 the area has considered the efficient enforcement of
                 temporal and geo-spatial access control policies, and
                 asymptotic results for the time and space complexity of
                 efficient enforcement schemes have been obtained.
                 However, for practical purposes, it is useful to have
                 explicit bounds for the complexity of enforcement
                 schemes. In this article we consider interval-based
                 access control policies, of which temporal and
                 geo-spatial access control policies are special cases.
                 We define enforcement schemes for interval-based access
                 control policies for which it is possible, in almost
                 all cases, to obtain exact values for the schemes'
