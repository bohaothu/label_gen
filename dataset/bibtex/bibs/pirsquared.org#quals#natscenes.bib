  abstract	= {Paintings are the product of a process that begins with
		  ordinary vision in the natural world and ends with
		  manipulation of pigments on canvas. Because artists must
		  produce images that can be seen by a visual system that is
		  thought to take advantage of statistical regularities in
		  natural scenes, artists are likely to replicate many of
		  these regularities in their painted art. We have tested
		  this notion by computing basic statistical properties and
		  modeled cell response properties for a large set of
		  digitized paintings and natural scenes. We find that both
		  representational and non-representational (abstract)
		  paintings from our sample (124 images) show basic
		  similarities to a sample of natural scenes in terms of
		  their spatial frequency amplitude spectra, but the
		  paintings and natural scenes show significantly different
		  mean amplitude spectrum slopes. We also find that the
		  intensity distributions of paintings show a lower skewness
		  and sparseness than natural scenes. We account for this by
		  considering the range of luminances found in the
		  environment compared to the range available in the medium
		  of paint. A painting's range is limited by the reflective
		  properties of its materials. We argue that artists do not
		  simply scale the intensity range down but use a compressive
		  nonlinearity. In our studies, modeled retinal and cortical
		  filter responses to the images were less sparse for the
		  paintings than for the natural scenes. But when a
		  compressive nonlinearity was applied to the images, both
		  the paintings' sparseness and the modeled responses to the
		  paintings showed the same or greater sparseness compared to
		  the natural scenes. This suggests that artists achieve some
		  degree of nonlinear compression in their paintings. Because
		  paintings have captivated humans for millennia, finding
		  basic statistical regularities in paintings' spatial
		  structure could grant insights into the range of spatial
		  patterns that humans find compelling.},

		  considerable redundancy. Although many forms of redundancy
		  have been investigated (e.g., pixel distributions, power
		  spectra, contour relationships, etc.), estimates of the
		  true entropy of natural scenes have been largely considered
		  intractable. We describe a technique for estimating the
		  entropy and relative dimensionality of image patches based
		  on a function we call the proximity distribution (a
		  nearest-neighbor technique). The advantage of this function
		  over simple statistics such as the power spectrum is that
		  the proximity distribution is dependent on all forms of
		  redundancy. We demonstrate that this function can be used
		  to estimate the entropy (redundancy) of 3x3 patches of
		  known entropy as well as 8x8 patches of Gaussian white
		  noise, natural scenes, and noise with the same power
		  spectrum as natural scenes. The techniques are based on
		  assumptions regarding the intrinsic dimensionality of the
		  data, and although the estimates depend on an extrapolation
		  model for images larger than 3x3, we argue that this
		  approach provides the best current estimates of the entropy
		  and compressibility of natural-scene patches and that it
		  provides insights into the efficiency of any coding
		  strategy that aims to reduce redundancy. We show that the
		  sample of 8x8 patches of natural scenes used in this study
		  has less than half the entropy of 8x8 white noise and less
		  than 60\% of the entropy of noise with the same power
		  spectrum. In addition, given a finite number of samples
		  ({\textless}2(20)) drawn randomly from the space of 8x8
		  patches, the subspace of 8x8 natural-scene patches shows a

		  observed difference in contrast sensitivity reflects a real
		  difference in the components of chrominance and luminance
		  in natural scenes. For this purpose a digital set of 29
		  hyperspectral images of natural scenes was acquired and its
		  spatial frequency content analyzed in terms of chrominance
		  and luminance defined according to existing models of the
		  human cone responses and visual signal processing. The
		  statistical 1/f amplitude spatial-frequency distribution is
		  confirmed for a variety of chromatic conditions across the
		  visible spectrum. Our analysis suggests that natural scenes
		  are relatively rich in high-spatial-frequency chrominance
		  information that does not appear to be transmitted by the
		  human visual system. This result is unlikely to have arisen
		  from errors in the original measurements. Several reasons
		  may combine to explain a failure to transmit
		  high-spatial-frequency chrominance: (a) its minor
		  importance for primate visual tasks, (b) its removal by
		  filtering applied to compensate for chromatic aberration of
		  the eyeâ€™s optics, and (c) a biological bottleneck
		  blocking its transmission. In addition, we graphically
		  compare the ratios of luminance to chrominance measured by
		  our hyperspectral camera and those measured
		  psychophysically over an equivalent spatial-frequency
		  range.},

  abstract	= {Spatial power spectra from natural images fall
		  approximately as the square of spatial frequency, a
		  property also called scale invariance (scaling). Various
		  theories for visual receptive fields consider scale
		  invariance key. Two hypotheses have been advanced in the
		  literature for why natural images obey scale invariance.
		  The first is that these images have luminance edges, whose
		  spectra fall as frequency squared. The second is that scale
		  invariance follows from natural images being essentially a
		  collage of independent, constant-intensity regions, whose
		  sizes follow a power-law distribution. Recently, an
		  argument by example was made against the first hypothesis.
		  Here we refute that argument and show that the first
		  hypothesis is consistent with the scaling under a wide
		  variety of distributions of sizes. There are two reasons
		  for this: first, for every frequency, the log-log slope of
		  the rotationally averaged power spectrum of an image is the
		  weighted mean of the log-log slopes from the independent
		  regions of the image formed by objects occluding one
		  another. Second, the log-log slopes of the spectrum
		  envelope for a constant-intensity region are 0 and -3 for
		  frequencies corresponding to periods much larger and much
		  smaller than the region's size, respectively. Therefore, it
		  is not surprising that natural images have log-log slopes
		  between -1.5 and -3, with a mean near -2.},

  abstract	= {A recent computational theory suggests that visual
		  processing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus
		  {(LGN)} serves to recode information into an efficient form
		  {(Atick} and Redlich, 1990). Information theoretic analysis
		  showed that the representation of visual information at the
		  level of the photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily
		  attributable to a high degree of spatial and temporal
		  correlation in natural scenes. It was predicted, therefore,
		  that the retina and the {LGN} should recode this signal
		  into a decorrelated form or, equivalently, into a signal
		  with a "white" spatial and temporal power spectrum. In the
		  present study, we tested directly the prediction that
		  visual processing at the level of the {LGN} temporarily
		  whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses
		  of individual neurons in the {LGN} of the cat to natural,
		  time-varying images (movies) and, as a control, to
		  white-noise stimuli. Although there is substantial temporal
		  correlation in natural inputs {(Dong} and Atick, 1995b), we
		  found that the power spectra of {LGN} responses were
		  essentially white. Between 3 and 15 Hz, the power of the
		  responses had an average variation of only +/-10.3\%. Thus,
		  the signals that the {LGN} relays to visual cortex are
		  temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of
		  X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their
		  responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that
		  whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the
		  linear filtering properties {(Enroth-Cugell} and Robson,
		  1966). Our results suggest that the early visual pathway is
		  well adapted for efficient coding of information in the

  abstract	= {A number of researchers have suggested that in order to
		  understand the response properties of cells in the visual
		  pathway, we must consider the statistical structure of the
		  natural environment. In this paper, we focus on one aspect
		  of that structure, namely, the correlational structure
		  which is described by the amplitude or power spectra of
		  natural scenes. We propose that the principle insight one
		  gains from considering the image spectra is in
		  understanding the relative sensitivity of cells tuned to
		  different spatial frequencies. This study employs a model
		  in which the peak sensitivity is constant as a function of
		  frequency with linear bandwith increasing (i.e.,
		  approximately constant in octaves). In such a model, the
		  "response magnitude" (i.e., vector length) of cells
		  increases as a function of their optimal (or central)
		  spatial frequency out to about 20 cyc/deg. The result is a
		  code in which the response to natural scenes, whose
		  amplitude spectra typically fall as 1/f, is roughly
		  constant out to 20 cyc/deg. An important consideration in
		  evaluating this model of sensitivity is the fact that
		  natural scenes show considerable variability in their
		  amplitude spectra, with individual scenes showing falloffs
		  which are often steeper or shallower than 1/f. Using a new
		  measure of image structure (the "rectified contrast
		  spectrum" or {"RCS")} on a set of calibrated natural
		  images, it is shown that a large part of the variability in
		  the spectra is due to differences in the sparseness of
		  local structure at different scales. That is, an image
		  which is "in focus" will have structure (e.g., edges) which
		  has roughly the same magnitude across scale. That is, the
		  loss of high frequency energy in some images is due to the
		  reduction of the number of regions that contain structure
		  rather than the amplitude of that structure. An "in focus"
		  image will have structure (e.g., edges) across scale that
		  have roughly equal magnitude but may vary in the area
		  covered by structure. The slope of the {RCS} was found to
		  provide a reasonable prediction of physical blur across a
		  variety of scenes in spite of the variability in their
		  amplitude spectra. It was also found to produce a good
		  prediction of perceived blur as judged by human subjects.},

		  the properties of complex cells in primary visual cortex to
		  their natural stimuli? To address this issue, we sampled
		  movies from a camera carried by a freely moving cat,
		  capturing the dynamics of image motion as the animal
		  explores an outdoor environment. We use these movie

		  intuition that many meaningful high-level variables, e.g.,

		  natural visual stimuli, we adapt the neurons to exhibit
		  firing rates that are stable over time. We find that
		  simulated neurons, which have optimally stable activity,
		  display many properties that are observed for cortical
		  complex cells. Their response is invariant with respect to
		  stimulus translation and reversal of contrast polarity.
		  Furthermore, spatial frequency selectivity and the aspect
		  ratio of the receptive field quantitatively match the
		  experimentally observed characteristics of complex cells.
		  Hence, the population of complex cells in the primary

		  receptive fields of simple and complex cells in the primary
		  visual cortex emerge from the statistical properties of
		  natural images by forcing the cell responses to be
		  maximally sparse or independent. We investigate how to
		  learn features beyond the primary visual cortex from the
		  statistical properties of modelled complex-cell outputs. In
		  previous work, we showed that a new model, non-negative
		  sparse coding, led to the emergence of features which code
		  for contours of a given spatial frequency band. {RESULTS:}
		  We applied ordinary independent component analysis to
		  modelled outputs of complex cells that span different
		  frequency bands. The analysis led to the emergence of
		  features which pool spatially coherent across-frequency
		  activity in the modelled primary visual cortex. Thus, the
		  statistically optimal way of processing complex-cell
		  outputs abandons separate frequency channels, while
		  preserving and even enhancing orientation tuning and
		  spatial localization. As a technical aside, we found that
		  the non-negativity constraint is not necessary: ordinary
		  independent component analysis produces essentially the
		  same results as our previous work. {CONCLUSION:} We propose
		  that the pooling that emerges allows the features to code
		  for realistic low-level image features related to step
		  edges. Further, the results prove the viability of
		  statistical modelling of natural images as a framework that
		  produces quantitative predictions of visual processing.},

		  first stage, contrast thresholds for detection of
		  distortions in the presence of natural images are computed
		  via wavelet-based models of visual masking and visual
		  summation in order to determine whether the distortions in
		  the distorted image are visible. If the distortions are
		  below the threshold of detection, the distorted image is

  abstract	= {From the preface:
		  
		  This book is both an introductory textbook and a research
		  monograph on modelling the statistical structure of natural
		  images. In very simple terms, ``natural images'' are
		  photographs of the typical environment where we live. In
		  this book, their statistical structure is described using a
		  number of statistical models whose parameters are estimated
		  from image samples.
		  
		  Our main motivation for exploring natural image statistics
		  is computational modelling of biological visual systems. A
		  theoretical framework which is gaining more and more
		  support considers the properties of the visual system to be
		  reflections of the statistical structure of natural images,
		  because of evolutionary adaptation processes. Another
		  motivation for natural image statistics research is in
		  computer science and engineering, where it helps in
		  development of better image processing and computer vision
		  methods.
		  
		  The book is targeted for advanced undergraduate students,
		  graduate students and researchers in vision science,
		  computational neuroscience, computer vision and image
		  processing. It can also be read as an introduction to the
		  area by people with a background in mathematical
		  disciplines (mathematics, statistics, theoretical physics).
		  Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the subject, the
		  book has been written so as to be accessible to an audience
		  coming from very different backgrounds such as psychology,
		  computer science, electrical engineering, neurobiology,
		  mathematics, statistics and physics. },

  abstract	= {The amplitude spectra of natural scenes are typically
		  biased in terms of the amount of content at the cardinal
		  orientations relative to the oblique orientations. This
		  anisotropic distribution has been related to the 'oblique
		  effect' (the greater visual sensitivity for simple
		  line/grating stimuli at cardinal compared to oblique
		  orientations). However, we have recently shown that with
		  complex visual stimuli possessing broadband spatial content
		  (i.e. random phase noise patterns), sensitivity for
		  detecting oriented manipulations of amplitude is best for
		  oblique orientations, and worst for horizontal orientations
		  (the 'horizontal effect'). Here we investigated this effect
		  with respect to the phase spectra of natural scenes.
		  Oriented manipulations of both amplitude and phase were
		  made on a set of natural scene images that were dominated
		  by naturally occurring structure at one of four
		  orientations in order to determine whether the presence of
		  predominant scene content, carried by the Fourier phase
		  spectra, altered the ability to detect an oriented
		  increment of amplitude. The horizontal effect was observed
		  regardless of any scene's content bias. In addition, a
		  content-dependent effect was observed which could be
		  related to the presence of spatial structure conveyed by
		  the phase spectra of this set of natural scenes. Results
		  are evaluated in the context of a divisive normalization
		  model.},

  abstract	= {Understanding neural responses with natural stimuli has
		  increasingly become an essential part of characterizing
		  neural coding. Neural responses are commonly characterized
		  by a linear-nonlinear {(LN)} model, in which the output of
		  a linear filter applied to the stimulus is transformed by a
		  static nonlinearity to determine neural response. To
		  estimate the linear filter in the {LN} model, studies of
		  responses to natural stimuli commonly use methods that are
		  unbiased only for a linear model (in which there is no
		  static nonlinearity): spike-triggered averages with
		  correction for stimulus power spectrum, with or without
		  regularization. Although these methods work well for
		  artificial stimuli, such as Gaussian white noise, we show
		  here that they estimate neural filters of {LN} models from
		  responses to natural stimuli much more poorly. We studied
		  simple cells in cat primary visual cortex. We demonstrate
		  that the filters computed by directly taking the
		  nonlinearity into account have better predictive power and
		  depend less on the stimulus than those computed under the
		  linear model. With noise stimuli, filters computed using
		  the linear and {LN} models were similar, as predicted
		  theoretically. With natural stimuli, filters of the two
		  models can differ profoundly. Noise and natural stimulus
		  filters differed significantly in spatial properties, but
		  these differences were exaggerated when filters were
		  computed using the linear rather than the {LN} model.
		  Although regularization of filters computed under the
		  linear model improved their predictive power, it also led
		  to systematic distortions of their spatial frequency
		  profiles, especially at low spatial and temporal
		  frequencies. },
