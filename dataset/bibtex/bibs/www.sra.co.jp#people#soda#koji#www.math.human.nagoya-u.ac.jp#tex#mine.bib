	abstract = "{The integer programming problem is: Given $m \times n$
		and $m \times l$ matrices $A$ and $b$ respectively of integers,
		find whether there exists an all integer $n \times l$ vector
		$x$ satisfying the $m$ inequalities $Ax\leq b$. In settling
		an important open problem, Lenstra(1981) showed in an elegant
		way that when $n$, the number of dimensions is fixed, there is
		a polynomial-time algorithm achieves a running-time of
		$O(c^{n^3}\cdot p(length of data))$ where $p$ is some
		polynomial and $c$ a constant independent of $n$. Since such
		an algorithm has several important applications - cryptography
		(Shamir (1982)), coding theory (Conway and Sloane (1982)), etc.
		it is important to improve the running time. We present an
		algorithm here that has a running time of $O(n^{9n}L log L)$
		where $L$ is the length of the input. Whereas Lenstra's
		algorithm in the worst case reduces an n-dimensional problem to
		$c^{n^2}-(n-l)$ dimensional problems, out algorithm effectively
		reduces an n-dimensional problem to at most polynomially many
		$(n-l)$ dimensional problems, thus achieving out time bound.
		The algorithm we propose, first finds a "more orthogonal" basis
		for lattice (see the next section for the definition of a
		lattice) than those of Lenstra (1981) and Lenstra, Lenstra and
		Lovasz (1982) but in time $O(n^{dn}\  poly(length of input))$.
		It then uses an enumeration technique to solve integer
		programming and related problems The proof that only
		$O(n^{d'n})$ possibilities need to be tried for this
		enumeration is based on Minkowski (1911)'s fundamental theorem
		on the geometry of numbers. The integer programming algorithm
		depends on algorithms we devise for finding in a similar time
		bound, the shortest nonzero vector in a lattice and the
		closest point of a lattice to a point in space. These then
		yield better algorithms than known before for simultaneous
		diophantine approximations (Lagarias (1982)).

		While this paper presents mainly the theoretical improvements
		that can be made in the algorithms, we discuss in section 6
		why in practice our estimates of running time may be overly
		pessimistic.

		The last part of the paper discusses some complexity issues.
		It is an interesting open problem as to whether finding the
		Euclidean shortest non-zero vector of a given lattice is
		NP-hard. (See Lenstra (1981), Van Emde Boas (1981) and
		Lagarias (1982)).

		We show first that this problem is polynomial-time Cook
		(Turing) reducible to the language:

		SHORT$ = \{(K;b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n)|b_1,\ldots,b_n$ are integer
			$n$ vectors and the Euclidean shortest, non-zero vector
			of the form $sum^n_{i=1}z_ib_i$, $z_i$ integers has
			length at most $k\}$

		Using this reduction, we show that given a subroutine for SHORT
		which works in time T-SHORT $(l)$-$l$  length of data, we can
		find in time $(p(n)\cdot T-SHORT(l))$ ($p$- a poly) a good
		approximation to the closest vector of a point to a lattice.
		We conjecture that the latter problem is NP-Hard(see also
		conjecture 2 of Lagarias (1982)). The proof of this conjecture
		would say that SHORT is Cook NP-complete and our reduction is
		essentially a polynomial-time Turing rather than a Karp (many
		one) reduction. To my knowledge, no other language is known to
		be NP-complete under Turing reductions which is not trivially
		also many-one NP-complete.}"

		functions has been introduced by Diffie and Hellman[3].
		Rivest, Shamir and Adleman[8] gave the first number theoretic
		implementation of a signature scheme based on a trapdoor
		function. If $f$ is a trapdoor function and $m$ a message,
		$f^{-1}(m)$ is the signature of $m$. The signature can be
		verified by computing $f(f^{-1}(m)) = m$. This approach
		presents the following problems even when $f$ is hard to
		invert:
		\begin{description}
		\item[1)] there may be special message spaces (or subsets of
			them) that are easy to sign without knowing them
			{\it trapdoor} information
		\item[2)] it is possible to forge the signature of random
			numbers; this violates the requirements of many
			protocols
		\item[3)] given a polynomial number of signed messages, it may
			be possible to sign a new one without knowing the
			trapdoor information.
		\end{description}
		We solve the above problems by exhibiting two signature schemes
		for which any strategy of an adversary, who has seen all
		previously signed messages, that has a moderate success in
		forging even a single additional signature, is transformable
		to a fast algorithm for factoring or inverting the RSA
		function. This provably holds for all message spaces with all
		possible Probability distributions. Thus, in particular, given
		the signature of $m$, forging the signature of $m+1$ or $2m$
		or $2^sm$ is as hard as factoring. The two signature schemes}"
