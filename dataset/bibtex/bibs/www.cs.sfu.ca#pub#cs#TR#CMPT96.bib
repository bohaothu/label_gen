  abstract =     "Forest harvest planning and scheduling problem is an
                 important part of forest resource management. It is a
                 complex task requiring expertise and integration of
                 multi-disciplinary fields. We review mathematical
                 programming as applied to forest harvesting problem.
                 The review suggests that long term scheduling is
                 difficult because of the prohibitive size of the model.
                 Such long term scheduling allows one to see if
                 sustainable forestry is actually being practiced. Thus,
                 this method alone is not sufficient for sustainable
                 forest harvesting. In this paper we propose how
                 constraint reasoning techniques from Artificial
                 Intelligence may be used along with simulation
                 modelling to solve forest harvesting problem
                 effectively. We show how these techniques can be used
                 to better model forest harvest plans and describe our
                 work in progress towards building better forest harvest
                 scheduling system.",
