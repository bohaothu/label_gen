    (1997) in support of his metalinguistic or quotation theory of
    proper names, according to which a name N means the individual
    named N. The data illustrate ten linguistic behaviours claimed to
    be shared by proper names and definite descriptions.  I argue
    that in some cases the behaviours have a common explanation which
    is based on a property independent of Geurts' analysis, and that
    in the remaining cases the behaviours are not actually shared.
    Thus these behaviours do not actually support the metalinguistic
    theory.      },

     An effort to automate the debugging of real programs is
     presented. We discuss possible choices in conceiving a debugging
     system. In order to detect all the semantic errors, it must have
     a knowledge of what the program is intended to achieve.
     Strategies and results are very dependent on the way of giving
     this knowledge.  In the LAURA system that we have designed, the
     program's task is given by means of a `program model'.
     Automatic debugging is then viewed as a comparison of programs.
     The main characteristics of LAURA are the representation of
     programs by graphs, which gets rid of many syntactical
     variations, the use of program transformations, realized on the
     graphs, and its heuristic strategy to identify step by step the
     elements of the graphs. It has been tested with about a hundred
     programs writen by students to solve eight different problems in
     various fields. It is able to recognize correct programs even if
     their structures are very different from the structure of the
     program model. It is also able to express exact diagnostics of
     errors, or at least to localize them. It could be an effective
     tool for students programmers.

     Solving analysis problems in physical worlds requires the
     representation of large amounts of knowledge. Recently, there
     has been much interest in using multiple models, in the
     engineering sense of the word, to capture the complex and
     diverse knowledge required during analysis. In this paper we
     represent physical domains as graphs of models, where the nodes
     of the graph are models and the edges are the assumptions that
     have to be changed in going from one model to the other. We
     introduce new, qualitative methods that automatically select and
     switch models during analysis.  Our approach has been
     successfully used for three implementations in the fields of
     mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics.

    the world wide web in order to enrich the concepts in existing
    ontologies. First, a method to retrieve documents from the WWW
    related to a concept is described. These document collections are
    used 1) to construct topic signatures (lists of topically related
    words) for each concept in WordNet, and 2) to build hierarchical
    clusters of the concepts (the word senses) that lexicalize a
    given word. The overall goal is to overcome two shortcomings of
    WordNet: the lack of topical links among concepts, and the
    proliferation of senses. Topic signatures are validated on a word
    sense disambiguation task with good results, which are improved
    when the hierarchical clusters are used.},

     Recent research in artificial intelligence has developed
     computational theories of agents' involvements in their
     environments.  Although inspired by a great diversity of
     formalisms and architectures, these research projects are
     unified by a common concern: using principled characterizations
     of agents' interactions with their environments to guide
     analysis of living agents and design of artificial ones. This
     article offers a conceptual framework for such theories, surveys
     several other fields of research that hold the potential for
     dialogue with these new computational projects, and summarizes
     the principal contributions of the articles in this special
     double volume. It also briefly describes a case study in these
     ideas--a computer program called Toast that acts as a short-order
     breakfast cook. Because its designers have discovered useful
     structures in the world it inhabits, Toast can employ an
     extremely simple mechanism to decide what to do next.

  journal = {Artificial Intelligence},

  number = {1},

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
     People are willing to rank simple objects of different shape and
     colour on the basis of "similarity". If machines are to reason
     about structure, this comparison process must be formalized.  That
     is, a distance measure between formal object representations
     must be defined. If the machine is reasoning with information to
     be presented to a human, the distance measure needs to accord
     with human notions of object similarity.  Since our perception of
     similarity is subjective and strongly influenced by situation,
     the measure should be tunable to particular users and contexts.
     This paper describes a distance measure between solid models
     which incorporates heuristics of the mental mappings humans use
     to compare objects. The first step is to formally represent
     objects in a way that reflects human visual segmentations. We
     use a modified boundary representation scheme in colour+physical
     space. The next step is to define a family of maps between these
     representations, motivated by considerations of how humans match
     shapes. The distance between two objects is essentially the cost
     of the lowest-cost map between them. The cost of a map
     incorporates a geometric measure of the smooth deformation
     required of edges and faces, a feature measure based on visually
     significant singular points, and a topological measure based on
     correspondence of visually significant vertices, edges and
     faces.  Tunable features of the match are: the relative cost of
     ignoring parts of objects; the treatment of colour; and whether
     or not the distance measure is required to be rotation
     invariant.
     An important application for such distance measures is to the
     development of user-friendly query of CAD and image databases.
     Query-by-example depends on implementation of a concept of
     likeness between object models in the database which, to be
     useful, must reflect the user's concepts. Another important
     application for distance measures is in automatic recognition of
     objects into classes whose members are not identical, so that
     the concept that ``this object is like object X'' is required. In
     the common situation that classes are based on human perceptions
     of visual similarity, the distance measure between the class
     prototype and the object to be classified should reflect those
     human perceptions.

    for reasoning about deliberation strategies for SimpleAPL
    programs.  SimpleAPL is a fragment of the agent programming
    language 3APL designed for the implementation of cognitive agents
    with beliefs, goals and plans. The logics are variants of PDL,
    and allow us to prove safety and liveness properties of SimpleAPL
    agent programs under different deliberation strategies. We show
    how to axiomatize different deliberation strategies for SimpleAPL
    programs, and, for each strategy we consider, prove a
    correspondence between the operational semantics of SimpleAPL and
    the models of the corresponding logic. We illustrate the utility
    of our approach with an example in which we show how to verify
    correctness properties for a simple agent program under different
    deliberation strategies.  },

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
     Proof-number search (pn-search) is designed for finding the
     game-theoretical value in game trees. It is based on ideas
     derived from conspiracy-number search and its variants, such as
     applied cn-search and [alpha][beta]-cn search. While in
     cn-search the purpose is to continue searching until it is
     unlikely that the minimax value of the root will change,
     pn-search aims at proving the true value of the root. Therefore,
     pn-search does not consider interim minimax values.
      Pn-search selects the next node to be expanded using two
     criteria: the potential range of subtree values and the number
     of nodes which must conspire to prove or disprove that range of
     potential values.  These two criteria enable pn-search to treat
     efficiently game trees with a non-uniform branching factor.
      It is shown that in non-uniform trees pn-search outperforms
     other types of search, such as [alpha]-[beta]
     iterative-deepening search, even when enhanced with
     transposition tables, move ordering for the full principal
     variation, etc.  Pn-search has been used to establish the
     game-theoretical values of Connect-Four, Qubic, and Go-Moku.
     There pn-search was able to find a forced win for the player to
     move first.  The experiments described here are in the domain of
     Awari, a game which has not yet been solved. The experiments are
     repeatable for other games with a non-uniform branching factor.
      This article describes the underlying principles of pn-search,
     presents an appropriate implementation, and provides an analysis
     of its strengths and weaknesses.

     Pruning decision trees is a useful technique for improving the
     generalization performance in decision tree induction, and for
     trading accuracy for simplicity in other applications. In this
     paper, a new algorithm called OPT-2 for optimal pruning of
     decision trees is introduced.  The algorithm is based on dynamic
     programming.  In its most basic form, the time and space
     complexities of OPT-2 are both [Theta](nC), where n is the
     number of test nodes in the initial decision tree, and C is the
     number of leaves in the target (pruned) decision tree. This is
     an improvement over the recently published OPT algorithm of
     Bohanec and Bratko (which is the only known algorithm for
     optimal decision tree pruning) especially in the case of heavy
     pruning and when the tests of the given decision tree have many
     outcomes. If so desired, the space required by OPT-2 can further
     be reduced by a factor of r at the cost of increasing the
     execution time by a factor that is bounded above by (r+1)/2
     (this is a considerable overestimate, however). From a practical
     point of view, OPT-2 enjoys considerable flexibility in various
     aspects, and is easy to implement.

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
     In many domains, an appropriate inductive bias is the
     MIN-FEATURES bias, which prefers consistent hypotheses definable
     over as few features as possible. This paper defines and studies
     this bias in Boolean domains.  First, it is shown that any
     learning algorithm implementing the MIN-FEATURES bias requires
     Theta((ln (1/[delta]) + [ 2p + p ln n])/ [epsilon]) training
     examples to guarantee PAC-learning a concept having p relevant
     features out of n available features.  This bound is only
     logarithmic in the number of irrelevant features.
      For implementing the MIN-FEATURES bias, the paper presents five
     algorithms that identify a subset of features sufficient to
     construct a hypothesis consistent with the training examples.
     FOCUS-1 is a straightforward algorithm that returns a minimal
     and sufficient subset of features in quasi-polynomial time.
     FOCUS-2 does the same task as FOCUS-1 but is empirically shown
     to be substantially faster than FOCUS-1. Finally, the
     Simple-Greedy, Mutual-Information-Greedy and Weighted-Greedy
     algorithms are three greedy heuristics that trade optimality for
     computational efficiency.
      Experimental studies are presented that compare these exact and
     approximate algorithms to two well-known algorithms, ID3 and
     FRINGE, in learning situations where many irrelevant features
     are present.  These experiments show that-contrary to
     expectations-the ID3 and FRINGE algorithms do not implement good
     approximations of MIN-FEATURES. The sample complexity and
     generalization performance of the FOCUS algorithms is
     substantially better than either ID3 or FRINGE on learning
     problems where the MIN-FEATURES bias is appropriate. These
     experiments also show that, among our three heuristics, the
     Weighted-Greedy algorithm provides an excellent approximation to
     the FOCUS algorithms.

     NEXUS is a computational system which uses a dictionary of 100
     to 150 event/state concepts to construct representations of
     narrative text.  Associated with each event/state concept are
     its deep case relations and their default values. Concepts in
     the dictionary are related by one of seven event/state concept
     coherence relations.  Relationships between concepts include a
     list of constraints on the matching of case arguments between
     the two concepts.
      NEXUS has been successfully applied to eight paragraph-length
     samples of text, including ``A Restaurant Story'', ``The Margie
     Story'', and ``Robbing a Liquor Store''. The resulting discourse
     representations have been used successfully to answer questions
     and compute summaries for these texts.
      The organization of this paper is as follows. After introducing
     the notion of event/state concept coherence, the paper proceeds
     by discussing the structure of the dictionary. This includes
     detailed descriptions of how individual concepts are represented
     and related, and some discussion of issues concerning causality
     and property inheritance. Then, after giving some brief examples
     of the representations produced by NEXUS, the NEXUS program is
     described.  NEXUS was programmed in procedural logic in LISP, so
     this section will include Horn clause specifications. The fourth
     section of the paper shows a subportion of the dictionary and,
     in detail, describes NEXUS processing of five samples of text.
     Included in the appendix are examples of NEXUS' input and
     output.

    are able to accommodate and reason across the different
    perspectives that may exist on a particular theory or situation.
    With the aim of obtaining an adequate logic for this problem, the
    knowledge representation community has extensively researched
    into the formalization of contexts as first-class citizens.
    However, most of the proposed logics of context only deal with
    the propositional case, which for many applications is not
    enough, and those tackling the quantificational case face many
    counterintuitive restrictions. In this paper, we present a
    model-theoretic semantics that, based on a cognitive approach to
    the notions of context and meaning, succeeds in addressing the
    quantificational case in a flexible manner that overcomes the
    limitations of the previous initiatives. The expressive power of
    the system will be evaluated in the paper by formalizing some of
    the benchmark examples that can be found in the literature.},

     The Internet provides access to a wealth of information. For any
     given topic or application domain there are a variety of
     available information sources.  However, current systems, such as
     search engines or topic directories in the World Wide Web, offer
     only very limited capabilities for locating, combining, and
     organizing information.  Mediators, systems that provide
     integrated access and database-like query capabilities to
     information distributed over heterogeneous sources, are critical
     to realize the full potential of meaningful access to networked
     information.
      Query planning, the task of generating a cost-efficient plan
     that computes a user query from the relevant information
     sources, is central to mediator systems.  However, query planning
     is a computationally hard problem due to the large number of
     possible sources and possible orderings on the operations to
     process the data.  Moreover, the choice of sources, data
     processing operations, and their ordering, strongly affects the
     plan cost.
      In this paper, we present an approach to query planning in
     mediators based on a general planning paradigm called Planning
     by Rewriting (PbR) (Ambite and Knoblock, 1997).  Our work yields
     several contributions.  First, our PbR-based query planner
     combines both the selection of the sources and the ordering of
     the operations into a single search space in which to optimize
     the plan quality.  Second, by using local search techniques our
     planner explores the combined search space efficiently and
     produces high-quality plans.  Third, because our query planner
     is an instantiation of a domain-independent framework it is very
     flexible and can be extended in a principled way.  Fourth, our
     planner has an anytime behavior.  Finally, we provide empirical
     results showing that our PbR-based query planner compares
     favorably on scalability and plan quality over previous
     approaches, which include both classical AI planning and
     dynamic-programming query optimization techniques.

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
     The PUPS theory and its ACT* predecessor are computational
     embodiments of psychology's effort to develop a theory of the
     origins of knowledge. The theories contain proposals for
     extraction of knowledge from the environment, a strength-based
     prioritization of knowledge, knowledge compilation mechanisms
     for forming use-specific versions of knowledge, and induction
     mechanisms for extending knowledge. PUPS differs from ACT*
     basically in its principles of induction which include
     analogy-based generalization, a discrimination mechanism, and
     principles of making causal inferences.  The knowledge in these
     theories can be classified into the knowledge level, algorithm
     level, and implementation level.  Knowledge at the knowledge
     level consists of information acquired from the environment and
     innate principles of induction and problem solving. Knowledge at
     the algorithm level consists of internal deductions, inductions,
     and compilation.  Knowledge at the implementation level takes
     the form of setting strengths for the encoding of specific
     pieces of information.

     The paper develops a multilevel approach to the design and
     analysis of systems with "action-oriented perception", situating
     various robot and animal ``designs'' in an evolutionary
     perspective. We present a set of biological design principles
     within a broader perspective that shows their relevance for
     robot design. We introduce schemas to provide a coarse-grain
     analysis of ``cooperative computation'' in the brains of animals
     and the ``brains'' of robots, starting with an analysis of
     approach, avoidance, detour behavior, and path planning in
     frogs. An explicit account of neural mechanism of avoidance
     behavior in the frog illustrates how schemas may be implemented
     in neural networks.  The focus of the rest of the article is on
     the relation of instinctive to reflective behavior. We
     generalize an analysis of the interaction of perceptual schemas
     in the VISIONS system for computer vision to a view of the
     interaction of perceptual and motor schemas in distributed
     planning which, we argue, has great promise for integrating
     mechanisms for action and perception in both animal and robot.
     We conclude with general observations on the lessons on relating
     structure and function which can be carried from biology to
     technology.  },

    Belief clearly influences deliberation.  The principle that
    rational belief is stake-invariant rules out at least one way
    that deliberation might influence belief.  The principle is
    widely, if implicitly, held in work on the epistemology of
    categorical belief, and it is built into the model of
    choice-guiding degrees of belief that comes to us from Ramsey and
    de Finetti.  Criticisms of subjective probabilism include
    challenges to the assumption of additive values (the package
    principle) employed by defenses of probabilism.  But the
    value-interaction phenomena often cited in such challenges are
    excluded by stake-invariance.  A comparison with treatments of
    categorical belief suggests that the appeal to stake-invariance
    is not ad hoc.  Whether or not to model belief as stake-invariant
    is a question not settled here.  },

    The idea that beliefs may be stake-sensitive is explored. This is
    the idea that the strength with which a single, persistent belief
    is held may vary and depend upon what the believer takes to be at
    stake.  The stakes in question are tied to the truth of the
    belief -- not, as in Pascals wager and other cases, to the
    belief's presence.  Categorical beliefs and degrees of belief are
    considered; both kinds of account typically exclude the idea and
    treat belief as stake-invariant, though an exception is briefly
    described. The role of the assumption of stake-invariance in
    familiar accounts of degrees of belief is also discussed, and
    morals are drawn concerning finite and countable Dutch book
    arguments.

    The bulk of this paper, then, is devoted to laying out an
    alternative conception of the objects of thought.  This
    conception supports the traditional idea that objects of thought
    are what we express by our utterance of sentences.  Moreover, on
    this new view, a partial account is afforded of what things are
    expressed by non-assertoric sentences - by sentences in moods
    other than the indicative.

    used as a basis to build a temporal modal logic of events. The
    whole apparatus contains neither past, present, and future
    operators nor indexicals, but only B-series relations and modal
    operators interpreted in the standard way. Determinism and
    indeterminism are then introduced into the logic of events via
    corresponding axioms. It is shown that, if determinism and

    meaning, the way in which they are formally introduced here
    represents the only right way to do this, given that we restrict
    ourselves to one real world and make no use of the many real
    worlds assumption. But then the result is that the very truth
    conditions for sentences about indeterministic events imply the
    existence of tensed truths, in spite of the fact that these
    conditions are formulated (in the indeterministic axiom) in terms
    of tenseless language. The tenseless theory of time implies
    determinism, while indeterminism requires the flow of time
    assumption.},

     An intelligent agent diagnoses perceived problems so that it can
     respond to them appropriately.  Basically, the agent performs a
     series of tests whose results discriminate among competing
     hypotheses.  Given a specific diagnosis, the agent performs the
     associated action.  Using the traditional information-theoretic
     heuristic to order diagnostic tests in a decision tree, the
     agent can maximize the information obtained from each successive
     test and thereby minimize the average time (number of tests)
     required to complete a diagnosis and perform the appropriate
     action.  However, in real-time domains, even the optimal
     sequence of tests cannot always be performed in the time
     available.  Nonetheless, the agent must respond.  For agents
     operating in real-time domains, we propose an alternative
     action-based approach in which: (a) each node in the diagnosis
     tree is augmented to include an ordered set of actions, each of
     which has positive utility for all of its children in the tree;
     and (b) the tree is structured to maximize the expected utility
     of the action available at each node.  Upon perceiving a
     problem, the agent works its way through the tree, performing
     tests that discriminate among successively smaller subsets of
     potential faults.  When a deadline occurs, the agent performs
     the best available action associated with the most specific node
     it has reached so far.  Although the action-based approach does
     not minimize the time required to complete a specific diagnosis,
     it provides positive utility responses, with step-wise
     improvements in expected utility, throughout the diagnosis
     process.  We present theoretical and empirical results
     contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of the

    eliminate certain deficiencies in the predictions made by
    possible world semantics concerning synonymy.  I provide two

    synonymy fails on both counts.  I then offer a different approach
    to problems with synonymy.  Synonymy judgments involve two
    different kinds of meaning: truth conditional content, provided
    by model theoretic semantics, and `information content', provided
    by a semantics in terms of conceptual role.  In developing the
    notion of information content, I show how it solves some of the

    affects the meanings of words, and how the meanings of words
    affect discourse structure.  We integrate three ingredients: a
    theory of discourse structure called SDRT, which represents
    discourse in terms of rhetorical relations that glue together the
    propositions introduced by the text segments; an accompanying
    theory of discourse attachment called DICE, which computes which
    rhetorical relations hold between the constituents, on the basis
    of the reader's background information; and a formal language for
    specifying the lexical knowledge -- both syntactic and semantic
    -- called the LKB.  Through this integration, we can model the
    information flow from words to discourse, and discourse to words.
    From words to discourse, we show how the LKE permits the rules
    for computing rhetorical relations in DICE to be generalized and
    simplified, so that a single law applies to several semantically
    related lexical items.  From discourse to words, we encode two
    novel heuristics for lexical disambiguation: disambiguate words
    so that discourse incoherence is avoided, and disambiguate words
    so that rhetorical connections are reinforced.  These heuristics
    enable us to tackle several cases of lexical disambiguation that
    have until now been outside the scope of theories of lexical
    processing.    },

    presuppositions, paying particular attention to the interaction
    between the knowledge resources that are required to The analysis
    has two main features.  First, we capture an analogy between
    presuppositions, anaphora and scope ambiguity (cf. van der Sandt
    1992), by utilizing semantic under-specification (cf. Reyle
    1993).  Second, resolving this underspecification requires
    reasoning about how the presupposition is rhetorically connected
    to the discourse context.
         This has several consequences. First, since pragmatic
    information plays a role in computing the rhetorical relation, it
    also constrains the interpretation of presuppositions. Our
    account therefore provides a formal framework for analysing
    problematic data, which require pragmatic reasoning. Second,
    binding presuppositions to the context via rhetorical links
    replaces accommodating them, in the sense of adding them to the
    context (cf.  Lewis 1979). The treatment of presupposition is
    thus generalized and integrated into the discourse update
    procedure.
         We formalize this approach in SDRT (Asher 1993; Lascarides &
    Asher 1993), and demonstrate that it provides a rich framework
    for interpreting presuppositions, where semantic and pragmatic
    constraints are integrated.     },

    counterfactual and indicative conditionals follows directly from
    the interaction between the semantics of the conditional and

    implementation of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and even
    `stylistic' constraints on anaphora. We build on our BUILDERS
    implementation of Discourse Representation (DR) Theory and
    Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) discussed in Wada & Asher
    (1986). We develop and argue for a semantically based processing
    model for anaphora resolution that exploits a number of desirable
    features: (1) the partial semantics provided by the discourse
    representation structures (DRSs) of DR theory, (2) the use of
    syntactic and lexical features to filter out unacceptable
    potential anaphoric antecedents from the set of logically
    possible antecedents determined by the logical structure of the
    DRS, (3) the use of pragmatic or discourse constraints, noted by
    those working on focus, to impose a salience ordering on the set
    of grammatically acceptable potential antecedents. Only where
    there is a marked difference in the degree of salience among the
    possible antecedents does the salience ranking allow us to make
    predictions on preferred readings. In cases where the difference
    is extreme, we predict the discourse to be infelicitous if,
    because of other constraints, one of the markedly less salient
    antecedents must be linked with the pronoun. We also briefly
    consider the applications of our processing model to other
    definite noun phrases besides anaphoric pronouns.     },

     The concept description formalisms of existing description
     logics systems allow the user to express local cardinality
     restrictions on the fillers of a particular role. It is not
     possible, however, to introduce global restrictions on the
     number of instances of a given concept. This article argues that
     such cardinality restrictions on concepts are of importance in
     applications such as configuration of technical systems, an
     application domain of description logics systems that is
     currently gaining in interest.  It shows that including such
     restrictions in the description language leaves the important
     inference problems such as instance testing decidable.  The
     algorithm combines and simplifies the ideas developed for the
     treatment of qualified number restrictions and of general
     terminological axioms.

    said against various recent objections.  The objections each cite
    some sort of linguistic,psychological, or epistemological fact
    that is supposed to show that on any viable notion of what
    aspeaker says in uttering a sentence, there ispragmatic intrusion
    into what is said.  Relying on a modified version of Grice's
    notion, on which what is said must be a projection of the syntax
    of the utteredsentence, I argue that a purely semantic notion is
    needed to account for the linguistically determined input to the
    hearer's inference to what, if anything, the speaker intends to
    be conveying in uttering thesentence.  },

  pages = {613--641},
  abstract = {Conventional programming languages are growing ever
    more enormous, but not stronger.  Inherent defects at the most
    basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive
    word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common
    ancestor -- the von Neumann computer, their close coupling of
    semantics to state transitions, their division of programming
    into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their
    inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for
    building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of
    useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.  An
    alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use
    of combining forms for creating programs.  Functional programs
    deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and
    nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their
    arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure
    declarations to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can
    use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a
    style not possible in conventional languages.  Associated with
    the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs
    whose variables range over programs and whose operations are
    combining forms.  This algebra can be used to transform programs
    and to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs in much the
    same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These
    transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out
    in the same language in which programs are written.  Combining
    forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also
    for the power of their associated algebraic laws.  General
    theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and
    termination conditions for large classes of programs. A new class
    of computing systems uses the functional programming style both
    in its programming language and in its state transition rules.
    Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics
    loosely coupled to states -- only one state transition occurs per
    major computation.},

     This paper describes the nucleus of a connectionist theory of
     low-level and intermediate-level vision.  The theory explains
     segmentation in terms of massively parallel cooperative
     computation among intrinsic images and a set of feature networks
     at different levels of abstraction.
      Explaining how parts of an image are perceived as a meaningful
     whole or gestalt is a problem central to vision.  A stepping
     stone towards a solution is recent work showing how to calculate
     images of physical parameters from intensity data.  Such images
     are known as intrinsic images, and examples are images of
     velocity (optical flow), surface orientation, occluding contour,
     and disparity. Intrinsic images show great promise; they are
     distinctly easier to work with than the original intensity
     image, but they are not grouped into objects.  A general way in
     which such groupings can be detected is to represent possible
     groupings as networks whose nodes signify explicit parameter
     values.  In this case the relation between parts of an intrinsic
     image and the gestalt parameters can be specified by active,
     two-way connections between an intrinsic image network and a
     gestalt parameter network.  The active connections will be
     many-to-one onto parameter value nodes that represent object
     features. The virtues of the methodology are that it can handle
     occlusion and noise and can specify intrinsic image boundaries.
     Furthermore, it can be made practical for high-dimensional
     feature spaces.  },

  acontentnote = {Abstract: Animate vision systems have gaze control
     mechanisms that can actively position the camera coordinate
     system in response to physical stimuli. Compared to passive
     systems, animate systems show that visual computation can be
     vastly less expensive when considered in the larger context of
     behavior. The most important visual behavior is the ability to
     control the direction of gaze. This allows the use of very low
     resolution imaging that has a high virtual resolution. Using
     such a system in a controlled way provides additional
     constraints that dramatically simplify the computations of early
     vision. Another important behavior is the way the environment
     ``behaves''. Animate systems under real-time constraints can
     further reduce their computational burden by using environmental
     cues that are perspicuous in the local context. A third source
     of economy is introduced when behaviors are learned. Because
     errors are rarely fatal, systems using learning algorithms can
     amortize computational cost over extended periods.  Further
     economies can be achieved when the learning system uses
     indexical reference, which is a form of dynamic variable
     binding.  Animate vision is a natural way of implementing this
     dynamic binding.

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
    Is the use of computer algebra technology
    beneficial for mechanised reasoning in and about mathematical
    domains?  Usually it is assumed that it is.  Many works in this
    area, however, either have little reasoning content, or use symbolic
    computation only to simplify expressions.  In work that has achieved
    more, the used methods do not scale up.  They trust the computer
    algebra system either too much or too little.  Computer algebra
    systems are not as rigorous as many provers.  They are not logically
    sound reasoning systems, but collections of algorithms.  We classify
    soundness problems that occur in computer algebra systems.  While
    many algorithms and their implementations are perfectly trustworthy,
    the semantics of symbols is often unclear and leads to errors.  On
    the other hand, more robust approaches to interface external
    reasoners to provers are not always practical because the
    mathematical depth of proofs algorithms in computer algebra are
    based on can be enormous.  Our own approach takes both
    trustworthiness of the overall system and efficiency into account.
    It relies on using only reliable parts of a computer algebra system,
    which can be achieved by choosing a suitable library, and deriving
    specifications for these algorithms from their literature.  We
    design and implement an interface between the prover Isabelle and
    the computer algebra library Sumit [sic] and use it to prove
    non-trivial theorems from coding theory.  This is based on the
    mechanisation of the algebraic theories of rings and polynomials.
    Coding theory is an area where proofs do have a substantial amount
    of computational content.  Also, it is realistic to assume that the
    verification of an encoding or decoding device could be undertaken
    in, and indeed, be simplified by, such a system.  The reason why
    semantics of symbols is often unclear in current computer algebra
    systems is not mathematical difficulty, but the design of those
    systems.  For Gaussian elimination we show how the soundness problem
    can be fixed by a small extension, and without losing efficiency.
    This is a prerequisite for the efficient use of the algorithm in a
    prover. },

     Abduction is an inference mechanism where given a knowledge base
     and some observations, the reasoner tries to find hypotheses
     which together with the knowledge base explain the observations.
     A reasoning based on such an inference mechanism is referred to
     as abductive reasoning. Given a theory and some observations, by
     filtering the theory with the observations, we mean selecting
     only those models of the theory that entail the observations.
     Entailment with respect to these selected models is referred to
     as filter entailment. In this paper we give necessary and
     sufficient conditions when abductive reasoning with respect to a
     theory and some observations is equivalent to the corresponding
     filter entailment. We then give sufficiency conditions for
     particular knowledge representation formalisms that guarantee
     that abductive reasoning can indeed be done through filtering
     and present examples from the knowledge representation
     literature where abductive reasoning is done through filtering.
     We extend the notions of abductive reasoning and filter
     entailment to allow preferences among explanations and models
     respectively and give conditions when they are equivalent.
     Finally, we give a weaker notion of abduction and abductive
     reasoning and show the later to be equivalent to filter

  pages = {69--91},
  abstract = {What do terms such as the committee, the league, and
    the group of women denote?  Pre-theoretically, group terms have a
    dual personality.  On the one hand, the committee corresponds to
    an entity as ideosyncratic in its properties as any other object;
    for instance, two otherwise identical committees can vary with
    respect to the purpose for which they were formed.  Call this
    aspect the group-as-individual.  On the other hand, the identity
    of a group is at least partially determined by the properties of
    its members; for instance, a committee will be a committee of
    women just in case each of its members is a woman.  Call this
    aspect the group-as-set.  Elaborating on suggestions in Link
    (1984) and Lasersohn (1988), I propose that group terms in
    English denote atomic individuals, that is, entities lacking
    internal structure.  In particular, it is not possible to
    determine the membership of a group by examining the denotation
    of a group term.  The proposed account correctly predicts that
    group terms systematically behave differently semantically (as
    well as syntactically) from plurals such as the men and
    conjunctions such as John and Bill.  Thus the atomic analysis
    advocated here stands in sharp contrast to previous proposals,
    including Bennet (1975), Link (1984), and Landman (1989), in
    which group terms are considered of a piece semantically with
    plurals and conjunctions.  Additional arguments come from the use
    of names of groups as rigid designators, from the parallel
    between group nouns and measure nouns, and from the distribution
    of group terms across two dialects of English.  },

     A fundamental problem in computer vision is how to determine the
     3-D spatial orientation of curves and surfaces appearing in an
     image.  The problem is generally underconstrained, and is
     complicated by the fact that metric properties, such as
     orientation and length, are not invariant under projection.
     Under perspective projection (the correct model for most real
     images) the transform is nonlinear, and therefore hard to
     invert. Two constructive methods are presented. The first finds
     the orientation of parallel lines and planes by locating
     vanishing points and vanishing lines.  The second determines the
     orientation of planes by `backprojection' of two intrinsic
     properties of contours: angle magnitude and curvature.},

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
     This paper presents a modular technique, amenable to parallel
     implementation, for the diagnosis of large-scale, distributed,
     asynchronous event-driven (namely, active) systems.  An active
     system is an abstraction of a physical system that can be
     modeled as a network of communicating automata.  Due to the
     distributed nature of the class of systems considered, and
     unlike other approaches based on synchronous composition of
     automata, exchanged events are buffered within communication
     links and dealt with asynchronously. The main goal of the
     diagnostic technique is the reconstruction of the behavior of
     the active system starting from a set of observable events. The
     diagnostic process involves three steps: interpretation,
     merging, and diagnosis generation.  Interpretation generates a
     representation of the behavior of a part of the active system
     based on observable events.  Merging combines the result of
     several interpretations into a new, broader interpretation.  The
     eventual diagnostic information is generated on the basis of
     fault events possibly incorporated within the reconstructed
     behavior.  In contrast with other approaches, the proposed
     technique does not require the generation of the, possibly huge,
     model of the entire system, typically, in order to yield a
     global diagnoser, but rather, it allows a modular and parallel
     exploitation of the reconstruction process.  This property, to a
     large extent, makes effective the diagnosis of real active
     systems, for which the reconstruction of the global behavior is
     often unnecessary, if not impossible.  },

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
     In this paper, we extend the theory of abstract argumentation
     systems proposed by Vreeswijk (1997). This framework stands at a
     high abstraction level and provides a general model for
     argumentation activity. However, the theory reveals an inherent
     limitation in that the premises of the argumentation process are
     assumed to be indefeasible, and this introduces the need of an
     implicit constraint on the strength of the arguments, in order
     to preserve correctness.  In many application contexts the
     information available to start reasoning is not guaranteed to be
     completely reliable, therefore it is natural to assume that
     premises can be discarded during the argumentation process. We
     extend the theory by admitting that premises can be defeated and
     relaxing the implicit assumption about their strength.
      Besides fixing the technical problems related to this hidden
     assumption (e.g., ensuring that warranted arguments are
     compatible), our proposal provides an integrated model for
     belief revision and defeasible reasoning, confirming the
     suitability of argumentation as a general model for the activity
     of intelligent reasoning in presence of various kinds of
     uncertainty.

     Learning methods based on dynamic programming (DP) are receiving
     increasing attention in artificial intelligence. Researchers
     have argued that DP provides the appropriate basis for compiling
     planning results into reactive strategies for real-time control,
     as well as for learning such strategies when the system being
     controlled is incompletely known. We introduce an algorithm
     based on DP, which we call Real-Time DP (RTDP), by which an
     embedded system can improve its performance with experience.
     RTDP generalizes Korf's Learning-Real-Time-A* algorithm to
     problems involving uncertainty. We invoke results from the
     theory of asynchronous DP to prove that RTDP achieves optimal
     behavior in several different classes of problems.  We also use
     the theory of asynchronous DP to illuminate aspects of other
     DP-based reinforcement learning methods such as Watkins'
     Q-Learning algorithm.  A secondary aim of this article is to
     provide a bridge between AI research on real-time planning and
     learning and relevant concepts and algorithms from control
     theory.},

  abstract = {Adjectives express properties, is the traditional
    opinion, be it properties an individual has itself (absolute
    properties) or properties that it has only in relation to others
    (relative properties or relations).  I shall show in this paper
    that most properties are not expressed by adjectives, rather they
    are denoted by them in what I call `thematic dimensions'.
    Properties are expressed by thematic dimensions and adjectives
    together.  Adjectives can be used in predicative, adnominal,
    adverbial, or adsentential position and function.  Besides
    elaborating the notion of thematic dimensions and explaining the
    relationship between properties and these dimensions, an aim of
    this paper is to assign suitable semantic types to adjectives and
    the thematic dimensions they are used in.  These serve for
    forming conjunctions and other combinations of thematic
    dimensions, and for forming conjunctions of expressions in
    several categories.  These operations form the basis for the
    construction of properties under perspectives, i.e. in thematic
    dimensions. },

    We show how labelled deductive systems can be
    combined  with a logical framework to provide a natural deduction
    implementation of a large and well-known class of propositional
    modal logics (including K, D,  T, B, S4, S4.2, K D45, S5).  Our
    approach is modular and based on a separation between a base logic
    and a labelling algebra, which interact through a fixed interface.
    While the base logic stays fixed, different modal logics are
    generated by plugging in appropriate algebras.  This leads  to a
    hierarchical structuring of modal logics with inheritance of
    theorems.  Moreover, it allows modular correctness proofs, both with
    respect to soundness and completeness for semantics, and
    faithfulness and adequacy of the implementation.  We also
    investigate the tradeoffs in possible labelled presentations:  We
    show that a narrow interface between the base logic and the
    labelling algebra supports modularity and provides an attractive
    proof-theory (in comparison to, e.g., semantic embedding) but
    limits the degree to which we can make use of extensions to the
    labelling algebra.  },

     Navigation involves recognizing the environment, identifying the
     current position within the environment, and reaching particular
     positions. We present a method for localization (the act of
     recognizing the environment), positioning (the act of computing
     the exact coordinates of a robot in the environment), and homing
     (the act of returning to a previously visited position) from
     visual input.  The method is based on representing the scene as
     a set of 2D views and predicting the appearances of novel views
     by linear combinations of the model views. The method accurately
     approximates the appearance of scenes under weak-perspective
     projection. Analysis of this projection as well as experimental
     results demonstrate that in many cases this approximation is
     sufficient to accurately describe the scene.  When
     weak-perspective approximation is invalid, either a larger
     number of models can be acquired or an iterative solution to
     account for the perspective distortions can be employed.
       The method has several advantages over other approaches. It uses
     relatively rich representations; the representations are 2D
     rather than 3D; and localization can be done from only a single
     2D view without calibration.  The same principal method is
     applied for both the localization and positioning problems, and
     a simple ``qualitative'' algorithm for homing is derived from this
     method.},

     From the perspective of an agent, the input/output behavior of
     the environment in which it is embedded can be described as a
     dynamical system.  Inputs correspond to the actions executable
     by the agent in making transitions between states of the
     environment.  Outputs correspond to the perceptual information
     available to the agent in particular states of the environment.
     We view dynamical system identification as inference of
     deterministic finite-state automata from sequences of
     input/output pairs.  The agent can influence the sequence of
     input/output pairs it is presented by pursuing a strategy for
     exploring the environment. We identify two sorts of perceptual
     errors: errors in perceiving the output of a state and errors in
     perceiving the inputs actually carried out in making a
     transition from one state to another. We present efficient,
     high-probability learning algorithms for a number of system
     identification problems involving such errors. We also present
     the results of empirical investigations applying these
     algorithms to learning spatial representations.},

     In this paper, examples of how an algorithm behaves on

     Computational Description Language) is presented and an
     algorithm for the synthesis of a procedure from a set of such
     example computations is described. The algorithm makes use of
     knowledge about variables, inputs, instructions and procedures
     during the synthesis process to guide the formation of a
     procedure.  Several examples of procedures actually synthesized
     are discussed.

     This paper presents and evaluates an optimal backtrack algorithm
     for solving tree-structured constraint satisfaction problems-a
     subset of constraint satisfaction problems which can be solved
     in linear time.  Previous algorithms which solve these problems
     in linear time perform expensive preprocessing steps before
     attempting solution. The work presented here resolves the open
     problem posed by Dechter (1990) on the development of an
     algorithm which avoids this preprocessing.  We demonstrate
     significant improvements in average-case performance over the
     previous state of the art, and show the benefits provided to
     backtrack enhancement schemes exploiting the easiness of
     tree-structured problems such as the cycle-cutset method
     (Dechter and Pearl, 1987).  },

     While the exploitation of problem structure by heuristic search
     techniques has a long history in AI (Simon, 1973), many of the
     advances in constraint-directed scheduling technology in the
     1990s have resulted from the creation of powerful propagation
     techniques.  In this paper, we return to the hypothesis that
     understanding of problem structure plays a critical role in
     successful heuristic search even in the presence of powerful
     propagators. In particular, we examine three heuristic
     commitment techniques and show that the two techniques based on
     dynamic problem structure analysis achieve superior performance
     across all experiments.  More interestingly, we demonstrate that
     the heuristic commitment technique that exploits dynamic
     resource-level non-uniformities achieves superior overall
     performance when those non-uniformities are present in the
     problem instances.

     Programs which perform partial evaluation, beta-expansion, and
     certain optimizations on programs, are studied with respect to

     described, one ``interpretive'' partial evaluator, which
     operates directly on the program to be partially evaluated, and
     a ``compiling'' system, where the program to be partially
     evaluated is used to generate a specialized program, which in
     its turn is executed to do the partial evaluation. Three
     applications with different requirements on these programs are
     described. Proofs are given for the equivalence of the use of
     the interpretive system and the compiling system in two of the
     three cases. The general use of the partial evaluator as a tool
     for the programmer in conjunction with certain programming

     Using the language of dynamical systems theory, a general
     theoretical framework for the synthesis and analysis of

     whose mutual interaction is in general jointly responsible for
     the agent's behavior. In addition, the adaptive fit between an
     agent and its environment is characterized in terms of the
     satisfaction of a given constraint on the trajectories of the
     coupled agent-environment system. The utility of this framework
     is demonstrated by using it to first synthesize and then analyze
     a walking behavior for a legged agent.

    such as good, bad, clever and skilful, should be analysed as
    one-place predicates in logical translation.  This approach, which
    is basically the traditional logical treatment of absolute
    adjectives, is to be contrasted with the approach in Montague
    (1974a) and Parsons (1972), wherein all adjectives are translated
    as two-place predicates, i.e. as semantic attributives.  The move
    away from the Montague-Parsons analysis is not new: Bartsch
    (1972.  1975), McConnell-Ginet (1973), Kamp (1975), Siegel
    (1976a, 1976b, 1979), Keenan &. Faltz (1978) and Klein (1980)
    have similarly advocated one-place predicate status, at least for
    fairly straightforward qualities (e.g. red, carnivorous, stony,)
    and even for degree adjectives (e.g. tall, short, heavy and old).
    Evaluatives, however, remain troublesome: Kamp concluded that
    their status was uncertain, and Siegel classified them as
    two-place predicates after much argument.  My remarks are directed
    primarily against Siegel's analysis; I intend to show that there
    are syntactic tests, some suggested by Siegel herself, which
    argue persuasively that evaluative adjectives should be
    interpreted as one-place predicates.},

     We present a new problem solving architecture based upon
     extremely fast search and pattern recognition. This
     architecture, which we have named SUPREM, has been implemented
     in the chess machine/program Hitech, and has proven to be very
     successful.  We describe the implementation in Hitech and the
     reasons for its success, and compare the SUPREM architecture to
     other well-known problem solving architectures.
      Certain interesting phenomena have become exposed as the result
     of our work with Hitech. The most important of these is that:
     ``The further a process can look ahead, the less detailed
     knowledge it needs''. We have also found that patterns can be
     formulated for quite complex problems in relatively small
     pattern recognizers, by eschewing generality and concentrating
     on likely patterns and their redundancies.},

  acontentnote = {Abstract:
     We describe a search algorithm for two-player games that relies
     on selectivity rather than brute-force to achieve success. The
     key ideas behind the algorithm are:
        (1) stopping when one alternative is clearly better than all
        the others, and
        (2) focusing the search on the place where the most progress
        can likely be made toward stopping.
      Critical to this process is identifying uncertainty about the
     ultimate value of any move. The lower bound on uncertainty is
     the best estimate of the real value of a move. The upper bound
     is its optimistic value, based on some measure of unexplored
     potential. This provides an
     I-have-optimism-that-needs-to-be-investigated attitude that is
     an excellent guiding force. Uncertainty is represented by
     probability distributions. The search develops those parts of
     the tree where moving existing bounds would be most likely to
     succeed and would make the most progress toward terminating the
     search.  Termination is achieved when the established real value
     of the best move is so good that the likelihood of this being
     achieved by any other alternative is minimal.
      The B* probability based search algorithm has been implemented
     on the chess machine Hitech. En route we have developed
     effective techniques for:
      -- producing viable optimistic estimates to guide the search,
      -- producing cheap probability distribution estimates to measure
         goodness,
      -- dealing with independence of alternative moves, and
      -- dealing with the graph history interaction problem.
      The report describes the implementation, and the results of
     tests including games played against brute-force programs. Test
     data indicate that B* Hitech is better than any searcher that
     expands its whole tree based on selectivity. Further, analysis
     of the data indicates that should additional power become
     available, the B* technique will scale up considerably better
     than brute-force techniques. },

     This paper is related to Holland's result on implicit
     parallelism. Roughly speaking, Holland showed a lower bound of
     the order of a n3/c13l to the number of schemata usefully
     processed by the genetic algorithm in a population of n = c1 .
     2l binary strings, with c1 a small integer. We ananlyze the case
     of a population of n = 2[beta]l binary strings where [beta] is a
     positive parameter (Holland's result is related to the case
     [beta] = 1). In the main result, we state a lower bound on the
     expected number of processed schemata for all [beta] < 0;
     moreover, we prove that this bound is tight up to a constant for
     all [beta] >= 1 and, in this case, we strengthen in probability
     the previous result.

     Circumscription is known to result in an inconsistency when
     applied to certain consistent theories. To counter this problem,
     closed nonrecursive circumscription, a restricted form of
     circumscription that has been proved not to affect the
     consistency of the theory over which circumscription is applied,
     has been proposed.  We show that closed nonrecursive
     circumscription involves an excessive weakening of standard
     circumscription by establishing that closed nonrecursive
     circumscription is incomplete for some crucial theories over
     which standard circumscription is consistent and complete.
     First, we prove that closed circumscription cannot yield the
     desired uniqueness formula for the simplest of existential
     theories.  Second, we prove that nonrecursive circumscription
     fails to be as strong as predicate completion for Horn clause
     theories.  Third, we prove that the natural way to strengthen
     circumscription, that is, adding more variable predicates, may
     weaken nonrecursive circumscription.  },

     There is no need to show the importance of arc-consistency in
     constraint networks. Mohr and Henderson [9] have proposed AC-4,
     an algorithm with optimal worst-case time complexity. But it has
     two drawbacks: its space complexity and average time complexity.
     In problems with many solutions, where constraints are large,
     these drawbacks become so important that users often replace
     AC-4 by AC-3 [8], a non-optimal algorithm. In this paper, we
     propose a new algorithm, AC-6, which keeps the optimal
     worst-case time complexity of AC-4 while working out the
     drawback of space complexity.  Moreover, the average time
     complexity of AC-6 is optimal for constraint networks where
     nothing is known about the constraint semantics.

     Extracting knowledge from a semantic network may be viewed as a
     process of finding given patterns in the network. On a von
     Neumann computer architecture the semantic net is a passive data
     structure stored in memory and manipulated by a program.  This
     paper demonstrates that by adopting a data-driven model of
     computation the necessary pattern-matching process may be
     carried out on a highly-parallel dataflow architecture. The
     model is based on the idea of representing the semantic network
     as a dataflow graph in which each node is an active element
     capable of accepting, processing, and emitting data tokens
     traveling asynchronously along the network arcs.  These tokens
     are used to perform a parallel search for the given patterns.
     Since no centralized control is required to guide and supervise
     the token flow, the model is capable of exploiting a computer
     architecture consisting of large numbers of independent
     processing elements.},

    that builds upon quite a number of previous analyses, preserving
    as far as possible the concepts that have already been clarified,
    but modifying the structure of earlier proposals in crucial
    respects.  ...  I will make the following assumptions:
    (i) The Positive of relative adjectives must be analysed in close
    connection with the Comparative, the Equative, and a number of
    related constructions.  ...
    (ii) The Positive of a relative adjective is interpreted with
    respect to a contextually determined class of comparison C. ...
    (iii) Relative adjectives assign to an individual x a degree dA
    where d might be conceived as a class of individuals that are
    equivalent with respect to A. ...
    (iv) The lexical representation of a relational adjective is
    semantically a kind of three-place predicate that relates an
    individual x, a standard of comparison v, and a difference c. ...
    (v) Comparative and Equative constructions are related to each
    other in roughly the following way: the complement clause of the
    Comparative specifies the value of v, while that of the Equative
    specifies the value of c.
    (vi) Relative adjectives belong to (at least) two classes, which
    I will call dimensional adjectives (tall, long, heavy etc.), and
    evaluative adjectives (clever, nice, good etc.). The degrees
    specified by D-adjectives are extents, the degrees specified by
    E-adjectives are grades.
    (vii) There is a small number of conditions on semantic
    representations that determine, among others, the value the
    standard of comparison v can assume in specified configurations.

    have contrastive stress without contrastive meaning.  The fact

  abstract = {The development of explicit theories of dynamic context
    change has led to a fundamentally new perspective on the
    interpretation of discourse.  In this paper I show that this
    development also opens up the possibility of approaching
    subclausal composition along similar lines.  More specifically, I
    propose a dynamic Bridging Theory, where type-driven rules apply
    directly to overt surface structures and proceed by building
    anaphoric bridges.  I then present three arguments that this
    dynamic approach is more faithful to natural language semantics
    than static Montagovian theories.
          First, the Bridging Theory explains how dynamic phenomena,
    such as temporal anaphora, generalize across different levels --
    from discourse all the way down to the lexicon -- in
    typologically distant languages.  Second, it explains the shift
    from defeasible defaults in discourse to structural determinism
    lower down, in terms of the type diversity needed to support
    type-driven bridging.  Deterministic type-driven bridging also
    makes detailed predictions about the exact impact of the
    structure on top-level anaphora, in various domains, and other
    presuppositional phenomena that it mediates.  And last but not
    least, the Bridging Theory combines a strong claim that semantics
    is universal -- bridgeable basic meanings are typically universal
    and type-driven bridges, all universal --with the ideal of strict
    surface composition.  },

  abstract = {The Eskimo language Kalaallisut (alias West
    Greenlandic) has traditionally been described as having a rich
    tense system, with three future tenses (Kleinschmidt 1851;
    Bergsland 1955; Fortescue 1984) and possibly four past tenses
    (Fortescue 1984).  Recently, however, Shaer (2003) has challenged
    these traditional claims, arguing that Kalaallisut is, in fact,
    tenseless.
        This paper settles the debate, in favour of Shaer, based on
    text studies examining how the English future auxiliaries
    will/would and is/was going to are rendered in Kalaallisut
    translations of five books: Harry Potter, The Old Man and the
    Sea, Pippi Longstocking (translated from the Swedish), The Blind
    Colt, and Black Star, Bright Dawn. The results of these five text
    studies are reported here in detail and in theory-neutral terms.
    They conclusively show that Kalaallisut is truly tenseless, but
    has an alternative system that conveys temporal information, even
    about the future, as precisely as the English tenses.      },

    in which reference to rimes is possible.  The key technical idea
    is to sort the atomic symbols of Prior's language and to impose
    different interpretational restrictions on the different sorts.
    Among the sorts introduced are nominals (which permit
    Reichenbachian analyses of tense and tense-in-texts to be
    reconstructed in tense logic) and sorts which mimic temporal
    indexicals and calendar terms.  The possibilities raised by
    sorting richer systems are briefly discussed.      },

     A development of a method for tracking visual contours is
     described. Given an ``untrained'' tracker, a training motion of an
     object can be observed over some extended time and stored as an
     image sequence. The image sequence is used to learn parameters
     in a stochastic differential equation model. These are used, in
     turn, to build a tracker whose predictor imitates the motion in
     the training set. Tests show that the resulting trackers can be
     markedly tuned to desired curve shapes and classes of motions.},

     We introduce a new approach to planning in STRIPS-like domains

     partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists.
      We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach,
     showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner,
     Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of
     interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also
     give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are
     quite sensible.  Since searches made by this approach are
     fundamentally different from the searches of other common

     Derivational analogy is a technique for reusing problem solving
     experience to improve problem solving performance. This research
     addresses an issue common to all problem solvers that use
     derivational analogy: overcoming the mismatches between past
     experiences and new problems that impede reuse.  First, this
     research describes the variety of mismatches that can arise and
     proposes a new approach to derivational analogy that uses
     appropriate adaptation strategies for each. Second, it compares
     this approach with seven others in a common domain. This
     empirical study shows that derivational analogy is almost always
     more efficient than problem solving from scratch, but the amount
     it contributes depends on its ability to overcome mismatches and
     to usefully interleave reuse with from-scratch problem solving.
     Finally, this research describes a fundamental tradeoff between
     efficiency and solution quality, and proposes a derivational
     analogy algorithm that can improve its adaptation strategy with
     experience.},

    difference between the from of OT as used in syntax on the one
    hand and its from as used in semantics on the other hand.
    Whereas in the first case.  OT takes the point of view of the
    speaker, in the second case the point of view of the hearer is
    taken.  The aim of this paper is to argue that the proper
    treatment of OT in natural language interpretation has to take
    both perspectives at the same time.  A conceptual framework is
    established that realizes the integration of both perspectives.
    It will be argued that this framework captures the essence of the
    Gricean maxims and gives a precise explication of Atlas &
    Levinson's (1981) idea of balancing between informativeness and
    efficiently in natural language processing.  The ideas are then

     We are interested in the problem faced by an agent with limited
     computational capabilities, embedded in a complex environment
     with other agents and processes not under its control. Careful
     management of computational resources is important for complex
     problem-solving tasks in which the time spent in decision making
     affects the quality of the responses generated by a system. This
     paper describes an approach to designing systems that are
     capable of taking their own computational resources into
     consideration during planning and problem solving. In
     particular, we address the design of systems that manage their
     computational resources by using expectations about the
     performance of decision-making procedures and preferences over
     the outcomes resulting from applying those procedures. Our
     approach is called deliberation scheduling.  Deliberation
     scheduling involves the explicit allocation of computational
     resources to decision-making procedures based on the expected
     effect of those allocations on the system's performance.},

     We propose a general-purpose method for finding high-quality

     self-organizing processes often found in nature. The method,
     called Extremal Optimization, successively eliminates extremely
     undesirable components of sub-optimal solutions.  Drawing upon
     models used to simulate far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it
     complements approximation methods inspired by equilibrium
     statistical physics, such as Simulated Annealing. With only one
     adjustable parameter, its performance proves competitive with,
     and often superior to, more elaborate stochastic optimization
     procedures.  We demonstrate it here on two classic hard
     optimization problems: graph partitioning and the traveling
     salesman problem.

  abstract = {In the analysis of the progressive proposed in the
    paper, two notions play a crucial role.  On the one hand, since
    the same event can be embedded into several possible developments
    that are relevant to the truth-conditions of the progressive, a
    first task of the analysis is to account for the part-of relation
    which connects an event with its possible continuations.  On the
    other hand, this kind of connection is largely dependent on
    contextual factors, and a second task of the paper is to analyze
    this notion of context both in terms of events in the world (the
    concomitant facts selected as relevant) and in terms of the
    situation of the discourse (the conversational background that
    makes those facts relevant).  After presenting, in section 2, the
    so-called imperfective paradox, in section 3, I address a problem
    of ambiguity engendered by the underdetermination of the data
    whilst a related issue is discussed in section 4.  The new
    examples analyzed in this section are an interesting illustration
    of the intensional character of the progressive.  In section 5, I
    discuss the role of mereological relations in the semantics of
    the progressive, whilst in section 6, I take into consideration
    the use of this aspectual form in connection withimprobable
    courses of events.  In the final sections, all these problems are
    considered from the point of view of asemantics for the
    progressive in which a mereological analysis of eventualities
    (based on the part-of relation) is combined with a contextualist
    approach.  },

    phenomenon is what I call discommodation, whose main feature
    consists in the fact that the missing piece of information,
    although essential to the comprehension of the utterance, cannot
    be shared by the addressee because it sounds problematic or even
    false to her. In such cases it is possible to open a
    presuppositional slot to take into account the assumptions that
    serve to select the reference of the noun phrase, but that are
    not incorporated into the revised context.  One of the main
    purposes of the paper is to propose a definition of truth (with
    respect to a presuppositional apparatus) that does not ignore the
    role of discommodation when different views of the common ground
    are involved.     },
