 abstract = {Development of a new video capture and personal electronic health record platform has been undertaken which will allow autism families to document their child's abnormal behavior and share this information confidentially with remotely located healthcare providers who can then provide each family with guidance regarding their child's behaviors and health condition. The technology is simple to use and will provide parents with support during times of crisis. The new platform meets the security, privacy, and control requirements associated with the multifaceted legal landscape of the USA. Preliminary surveys indicate that application of this type of platform in classroom settings as well as in the home environment are being received favorably by parents, educators, and healthcare providers alike. The new technology is being commercialized in the United States and internationally to the autism community under the trade names BI-Capture and BI-CARE.},
