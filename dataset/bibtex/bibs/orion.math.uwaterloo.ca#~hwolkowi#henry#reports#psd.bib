#                 The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies
#          at URL    http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/index.html
# as part of:  Bibliographies on Mathematics
#         Bibliography on Semidefinite Programming
#  with URL     http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Math/psd.html
### IMPORTANT NOTE!!! The 'string' definitions for journals is given
###     in the file     .master.bib. 
#### This is also available as the
####     Bibliography on optimization and matrix theory
####    with URL http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Math/optimization.html
###########
###   If you are now using another file other than .master.bib
#####   (e.g.   .psd.bib)  then you should include  .master.bib  FIRST
####   in the  \bibliography line, i.e. \bibliography{.master,....}
### ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE!!! The last entries are my publications.
##          These are included since many are related to SDP.
