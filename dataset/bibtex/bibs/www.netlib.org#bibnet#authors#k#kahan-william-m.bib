  abstract =     "A standard for binary floating-point arithmetic is
                 being proposed and there is a very real possibility
                 that it will be adopted by many manufacturers and
                 implemented on a wide range of computers. This
                 development matters to all of us concerned with
                 numerical software. One of the principal motivations
                 for the standard is to distribute more evenly the
                 burden of portability between hardware and software. At
                 present, any program intended to be portable must be
                 designed for a mythical computer that enjoys no
                 capability not supported by every computer on which the
                 program will be run. That mythical computer is so much
                 grubbier than almost any real computer that a portable
                 program will frequently be denigrated as ``suboptimal''
                 and then supplanted by another program supposedly
                 ``optimal'' for the real computer in question but often
                 inferior in critical respects like reliability. A
                 standard --- almost any reasonable standard --- will
                 surely improve the situation. A standard environment
                 for numerical programs will promote fair comparisons
                 and sharing of numerical codes, thereby lowering costs
                 and prices. Furthermore, we have chosen repeatedly to
                 enrich that environment in order that applications
                 programs be simpler and more reliable. Thus will the
                 onus of portability be shared among hardware
                 manufacturers and software producers.",

                 themselves with what the machine designers offered and
                 be glad that the hardware worked at all. Later, with
                 the introduction of higher-level languages, the
                 computing environment was modified by the language
                 designers who attempted to resolve a three-cornered
                 tug-of-war among implementation efficiency, program
                 portability, and usefulness to the programmer. The
                 conflict between the first two resulted in languages
                 that reflected the least common denominator of
                 available hardware, since language designers were
                 disinclined to mention any capability not available on
                 all computers. A case in point is floating-point
                 arithmetic, where the subtleties of overflow,
                 underflow, and rounding are generally well beyond the
                 control of the programmer in a high-level language. The
                 new standard for binary floating-point arithmetic that
                 has been proposed by IEEE Computer Society's
                 Floating-Point Committee, Task P754 [1], makes an
                 attempt to escape from this situation. It represents

  abstract =     "The IBM ACRITH package of numerical software is
                 advertised as reliable and easy to use; but sometimes
                 its results must astonish or confuse a naive user, This
                 report exhibits a few of the surprises. For instance, a
                 finite continued fraction, easy to evaluate in two
                 dozen keystrokes on a handheld calculator, causes
                 ACRITH to overflow either exponent range or 15
                 Megabytes of virtual memory. Lacking access to source
                 code, we must speculate to explain the anomalies. Some
                 seem attributable to small bugs in the code; some to
                 optimistic claims or oversimplifications in the code's
                 documentation; some to flaws in the doctrine underlying
                 the code. We conclude that different techniques than
                 used by ACRITH might have been about as accurate and
                 yet more economical, robust and perspicuous.",

                 floating-point number in log/sub 2/n parallel steps.
                 The time complexity of the present algorithm also is
                 O(logn), and the space complexity is O(n). This
                 algorithm enables a highly accurate result to be
                 obtained with guarantee. The theoretical analysis and
                 the numerical experiments on a parallel computer show
                 that this algorithm is as accurate as Kahan's, which is
                 the fastest and an accurate serial algorithm for the
                 summation of the numbers, and also that the present

                 simulations, especially climate modeling, on
                 distributed memory parallel computers are becoming
                 critical issues. In particular, global summation and
                 dot products of distributed arrays are very susceptible
                 to rounding errors. We analyzed several accurate
                 summation methods and found that two methods are
                 particularly effective to improve (ensure)
                 reproducibility: Kahan's self-compensated summation and
                 Bailey's double-double precision summation. We provide
                 an MPI operator MPI\_SUMDD to work with MPI collective
                 operations to ensure a scalable implementation on large
                 number of processors. The final methods are

  abstract =     "We consider the efficient and accurate computation of
                 Givens rotations. When $f$ and $g$ are positive real
                 numbers, this simply amounts to computing the values of
                 $c = f/\sqrt{f^2+g^2}$, $s = g/\sqrt{f^2+g^2}$, and $r
                 = \sqrt{f^2+g^2}$. This apparently trivial computation
                 merits closer consideration for the following three
                 reasons. First, while the definitions of $c$, $s$ and
                 $r$ seem obvious in the case of two nonnegative
                 arguments $f$ and $g$, there is enough freedom of
                 choice when one or more of $f$ and $g$ are negative,
                 zero or complex that LAPACK auxiliary routines SLARTG,
                 CLARTG, SLARGV and CLARGV can compute rather different
                 values of $c$, $s$ and $r$ for mathematically identical
                 values of $f$ and $g$. To eliminate this unnecessary
                 ambiguity, the BLAS Technical Forum chose a single
                 consistent definition of Givens rotations that we will
                 justify here. Second, computing accurate values of $c$,
                 $s$ and $r$ as efficiently as possible and reliably
                 despite over/underflow is surprisingly complicated. For
                 complex Givens rotations, the most efficient formulas
                 require only one real square root and one real divide
                 (as well as several much cheaper additions and
                 multiplications), but a reliable implementation using
                 only working precision has a number of cases. On a Sun
                 Ultra-10, the new implementation is slightly faster
                 than the previous LAPACK implementation in the most
                 common case, and 2.7 to 4.6 times faster than the
                 corresponding vendor, reference or ATLAS routines. It
                 is also more reliable; all previous codes occasionally
                 suffer from large inaccuracies due to over/underflow.
                 For real Givens rotations there are also improvements
                 in speed and accuracy, though not as striking. Third,
                 the design process that led to this reliable
                 implementation is quite systematic, and could be
                 applied to the design of similarly reliable
                 subroutines.",

                 Subroutines): Extended and Mixed Precision BLAS.
                 Permitting higher internal precision and mixed
                 input\slash output types and precisions allows us to
                 implement some algorithms that are simpler, more
                 accurate, and sometimes faster than possible without
                 these features. The new BLAS are challenging to
                 implement and test because there are many more
                 subroutines than in the existing Standard, and because
                 we must be able to assess whether a higher precision is
                 used for internal computations than is used for either
                 input or output variables. We have therefore developed
                 an automated process of generating and systematically
                 testing these routines. Our methodology is applicable
                 to languages besides C. In particular, our algorithms
                 used in the testing code will be valuable to all other
                 BLAS implementors. Our extra precision routines achieve
                 excellent performance---close to half of the machine
                 peak Megaflop rate even for the Level 2 BLAS, when the

                 reliability of programs that use binary floating-point
                 arithmetic. Floating point is almost universally
                 implemented with special-purpose hardware that tucks
                 into a small corner of the CPU chip and runs in the
                 hundreds of Mflops to Gflops range. Single-stepping
                 through today's floating-point software to debug it
                 often turns out to be futile. The concept of a NaN,
                 standing for ``not a number'', evolved from an
                 ``indefinite'' in Seymour Cray's CDC 6600. IEEE 754, by
                 default, requires an untrapped ``invalid operation'',
                 to signal itself by raising a flag and to deliver a NaN
                 just when any other result, be it finite or infinite,
                 would cause worse confusion. The NaN lets a program
                 retain control unless the program or programmer directs
                 its cancellation upon an invalid operation. Thus, a
                 program conducting a search can return to the realm
                 being searched after an accidental foray beyond a
                 boundary whose existence and location were previously
                 unknown. A sNaN differs from the other quiet NaNs by
                 trapping any attempt to perform arithmetic upon it;
                 then a trap-handler must interpret this sNaN.",

  abstract =     "We present the design and testing of an algorithm for
                 iterative refinement of the solution of linear
                 equations where the residual is computed with extra
                 precision. This algorithm was originally proposed in
                 1948 and analyzed in the 1960s as a means to compute
                 very accurate solutions to all but the most
                 ill-conditioned linear systems. However, two obstacles
                 have until now prevented its adoption in standard
                 subroutine libraries like LAPACK: (1) There was no
                 standard way to access the higher precision arithmetic
                 needed to compute residuals, and (2) it was unclear how
                 to compute a reliable error bound for the computed
                 solution. The completion of the new BLAS Technical
                 Forum Standard has essentially removed the first
                 obstacle. To overcome the second obstacle, we show how
                 the application of iterative refinement can be used to
                 compute an error bound in any norm at small cost and
                 use this to compute both an error bound in the usual
                 infinity norm, and a componentwise relative error
                 bound. We report extensive test results on over $6.2$
                 million matrices of dimensions $5$, $10$, $100$, and
                 $1000$. As long as a normwise (componentwise) condition
                 number computed by the algorithm is less than
                 $1/max\{10,\sqrt{n}\}\varepsilon_w$, the computed
                 normwise (componentwise) error bound is at most $2
                 max\{10, \sqrt{n}\} \cdot \varepsilon_w$, and indeed
                 bounds the true error. Here, $n$ is the matrix
                 dimension and $\varepsilon_w = 2^{-24}$ is the working
                 precision. Residuals were computed in double precision
                 (53 bits of precision). In other words, the algorithm
                 always computed a tiny error at negligible extra cost
                 for most linear systems. For worse conditioned problems
                 (which we can detect using condition estimation), we
                 obtained small correct error bounds in over 90\% of
                 cases.",

                 error-analysis. Occasional anomalous results were
                 expected. Often they were attributed wrongly to
                 ``Ill-Condition''. Putting one's data through several
                 numerical methods some of whose results might agree was
                 a prudent policy. Those days are back. Their challenges
                 will be illustrated by a program like some used by
                 structural engineers for forty years. To cope, we need

                 accurately the discriminant. This is a known difficult
                 problem, and this algorithm leads to an error bounded
                 by 2 ulps of the floating-point result. The proofs
                 involved are long and tricky and even trickier than
                 expected as the test involved may give a result
                 different from the result of the same test without
                 rounding. We give here the total demonstration of the
                 validity of this algorithm, and we provide sufficient
                 conditions to guarantee that neither overflow nor
                 underflow will jeopardize the result. The IEEE-754
                 double-precision program is annotated using the Why
                 platform and the proof obligations are done using the
                 Coq automatic proof checker.",
