%X This discussion panel will focus on guidance that the field of human factors
can provide in the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System
(NextGen) in the United States, ranging from input regarding the overall
operational concept for NextGen to approaches for crafting the details of
specific designs. The discussion will include consideration of how the
feasibility of alternative implementations should inform the operational
concept.
   To provide the necessary perspectives, the expertise represented on this
panel provides both breadth and depth regarding the contributions that the
field of human factors needs to provide to the development of NextGen in the
United States. This expertise extends across a number of functional roles in
the aviation system (piloting, air traffic control, air traffic flow
management, airport surface management and flight dispatching). It also spans a
wide range of human factors issues including considerations of trust, cognitive
complexity, information overload, interruption management, human reliability,
automation reliability, timesharing, mental workload, shared situation
awareness and the design of distributed work systems. Finally, this expertise
encompasses experience with human factors program management, system design and
evaluation (including both empirical testing and the use of computational
models). Panelists will be posed with variations on the question of "what are
concrete ways in which the field of human factors can guide the development of
an effective Next Generation Air Transportation System?" based on the system
perspectives that they represent.

%X Increasingly detailed planning is addressing a range of human factors
considerations associated with the Next Generation Air Transportation System
(NextGen). The practice of human factors program management for NextGen poses
complex opportunities and challenges. Relationships between human factors
research programs and their elements and with other programs and portfolios are
identified and aligned using a human system integration roadmap. Effective
planning that addresses human factors issues associated with transitions of new
NextGen technologies, automation and procedures will facilitate realization of
intended benefits from NextGen involving increased throughput, efficiency, and
safety in the National Airspace System.

%X The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is designed to
transform the existing air traffic system and introduce new procedures to
accommodate increased traffic levels. This simulation evaluated three potential
procedures using two simulated en route controller workstation systems. The
Baseline system modeled the workstation planned for use in the field after
2010. The Future En Route Workstation (FEWS) added features and functions to
the Baseline system to further support the management of high traffic levels
and procedure use. When using the FEWS system, the participants managed more
aircraft, held traffic less, and reported lower workload than when using the
Baseline system. When the participants worked with Area Navigation (RNAV)
procedures that included both lateral and vertical conformance constraints,
they managed more aircraft and issued fewer voice clearances than when they
worked with RNAV procedures that included only lateral constraints. We did not
find additional benefits for the other two delegated aircraft procedures.

%X The subject of the current research is a Next Generation Air Transportation
System (NextGen) concept that involves automation-assisted separation assurance
within the high altitude (at or above 29,000 feet) en route environment. The
concept is designed to enable controllers to provide both safe and efficient
air traffic services at much higher traffic densities than today. The presented
research addressed the question of how responsibility should be handled for the
resolution of a conflict that is predicted to occur in a sector other than
where it was detected. Two possibilities, namely a De-Conflicting AirPlanes
procedure (DCAP) versus a De-Conflicting AirSpace procedure (DCAS) were
examined with recently retired controllers under human-in-the-loop simulations
with scripted aircraft conflicts. Results showed that controllers preferred
DCAS, in which they took less time to resolve conflicts and experienced less
coordination with one another. However, the results did not yield significant
differences among other plane performance metrics between DCAP and DCAS. The
present analyses indicated that controllers are capable of meeting demands of
NextGen with ownership/coordination procedures (e.g. DCAP.) similar to today.
However, allowing separation assurance responsibilities to extend more
seamlessly across sector boundaries (e.g. DCAS) could evidently be more
agreeable for them.

%X In this study, pilots were asked to achieve a specific time in trail while
flying an arrival into Louisville International airport. Weather shortly before
the start of the descent added variability to the initial intervals. A spacing
tool calculated airspeeds intended to achieve the desired time in trail at the
final approach fix. Pilots were exposed to four experimental conditions which
varied how strictly the pilots were told to follow these speeds and whether
speeds had to be entered into the autopilot manually. Giving the pilots more
discretion had little effect on the final spacing interval. However, pilots
required to enter speeds into the autopilot manually did not effectively manage
their airplane's energy resulting in less accurate performance. While these
results may not always generalize to alternative spacing implementations, one
should not assume pilots manually closing the loop on automated commands can
perform as well as a fully automated system.

%X This paper describes the development and implementation of the Automation
Design Advisor Tool (ADAT). ADAT is being developed with NASA support to assist
aviation designers throughout all phases of design in creating systems that
ensure effective and efficient human-automation interaction on the modern
flight deck. The tool can be applied to both new "blank slate" designs, and to
improved versions of existing technologies. In particular, the current version
of the tool evaluates proposed Flight Management System (FMS) designs in terms
of their ability to support pilots in instructing and monitoring the automated
system. ADAT identifies potential design deficiencies, provides specific
(re)design recommendations, and offers access to summaries of empirical
research on the underlying reasons for and the effectiveness of solutions to
breakdowns in pilot-automation coordination.

%X The limitations of the current National Airspace System (NAS) have
necessitated the planning and development of the Next Generation Air
Transportation System (NextGen). The core objectives of NextGen include
increasing the safety and efficiency of air traffic management as well as
expanding throughput at the nation's most congested airports. However, NextGen
advances will also precipitate changes in the fundamental structure of air
traffic operations, which could have profound effects on how humans,
technology, and policy interact. Robust means for design and evaluation are
needed to ensure success. Panel members will discuss current works in progress
devised to facilitate NextGen objectives.

%X Next generation aviation operations will place a much greater dependence on
automation usage, and therefore additional emphasis needs to be placed on the
evaluation of human automation interaction in the design and evaluation of
these systems. Additionally, new airworthiness regulations and regulatory
certification processes are beginning to focus on the design and verification
testing of the pilot-automation interaction. Current human computer interaction
analyses (computational human performance models and task analysis methods) are
not effectively usable within the constrained timeline of real world design and
certification processes. Fundamental and theoretical work is needed to develop
methods and tools that will provide designers and regulators with the means of
testing and providing useful feedback about the efficacy of these interactions.

%X An experiment was conducted to obtain empirical evidence that controllers,
in addition to detecting and resolving expected losses-of-separation, intervene
to mitigate potential conflicts that would not result in a loss of separation
assuming proper compliance by both pilots. Participant controllers controlled
traffic that contained aircraft expected to lose separation as well as others
that would not lose separation, but were configured in such a way that a loss
of separation could occur quickly if one of the aircraft did not comply with
their clearance. Binary logistic regressions performed on the aircraft that
were subjected to control by the aircraft provides evidence that this
mitigation set improves the predictive power of a model to identify aircraft to
which the participants applied control. Moreover, a regression performed on the
aircraft for whom controllers provided informative commands, particularly
traffic identification calls, demonstrated differences between the
loss-of-separation aircraft and the mitigation aircraft. The results have
implications for understanding strategies used by air traffic controllers when
deciding for what aircraft controllers will intervene.

%X We analyzed samples of aircraft track data involving conflict alerts and
subsequent resolution maneuvers from five U.S. air route traffic control
centers. Vertical conflict resolution maneuvers were used in the majority of
the cases examined. Within the vertical dimension, reductions of current
vertical change (climb or descent) were collectively the most frequent
resolution maneuver type, but descents were about three times as frequent as
climbs. Three contingency analyses were performed to test for independence
between conflict geometries and subsequent resolution maneuvers. The results
show that conflict resolution maneuvers do not seem to be independent from
conflict geometries. Additional analyses on conflict angles and vertical speed
differences between aircraft as continuous variables revealed
disproportionately fewer turns on crossing courses than on opposite or same
courses. These results provide critical baseline information for understanding
just how large departures from the current ingrained practices the advent of
the NextGen air traffic management infrastructure may bring about, particularly
in extremely safety-critical tasks such as airborne conflict resolutions.
Pilots' conflict resolution maneuver preferences have received some attention,
but corresponding research on air traffic controllers' practices is almost
nonexistent. Moreover, our results emerged from objective data through
objective analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first time analyses like
these have been applied to data like these.

tower-based runway safety alerts. The results of this study suggest controllers
like to gather as much information about the situation, within a reasonable
amount of time (usually less than 5 seconds), before they initiate the action
of issuing instructions to the aircraft involved in the emergency.

%X Pilot workload was examined during simulated flights requiring flight
deck-based merging and spacing while avoiding weather. Pilots used flight deck
tools to avoid convective weather and space behind a lead aircraft during an
arrival into Louisville International airport. Three conflict avoidance
management concepts were studied: pilot, controller or automation primarily
responsible. A modified Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT) metric
showed highest workload during the approach phase of flight and lowest during
the en-route phase of flight (before deviating for weather). In general, the
modified ATWIT was shown to be a valid and reliable workload measure, providing
more detailed information than post-run subjective workload metrics. The trend
across multiple workload metrics revealed lowest workload when pilots had both
conflict alerting and responsibility of the three concepts, while all objective
and subjective measures showed highest workload when pilots had no conflict
alerting or responsibility. This suggests that pilot workload was not tied
primarily to responsibility for resolving conflicts, but to gaining and/or
maintaining situation awareness when conflict alerting is unavailable.

behavior, 2) use of modern Web-based weather preflight briefing products, and

weather knowledge or weather-related flight behavior. No highly significant,
meaningful, simple effects were found for two 90-minute video weather training
products on weather knowledge or subsequent flight safety on a simulated flight
involving deteriorating weather. A data-collecting emulation of
www.aviationweather.gov suggests that mere time spent on preflight briefing,
pages viewed, and page view duration alone are not adequate predictors of
either quality of preflight briefing nor subsequent flight safety. Finally, no
important differences between local and non-local pilots were seen, implying
that FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute flightdeck studies are generalizable
to the national population of U.S. GA pilots.

%X Two tests were conducted to evaluate enhancements to the operator interface
of the C-5 AMP engine display format. Proposed enhancements of interest were
the addition of a grey filled arc within the engine gauges to reflect current
state, the addition of a red box to indicate a shutdown engine, and the
addition of scale markings to N1 and fuel flow gauges. The objective of the
tests were to 1) evaluate the addition of the grey arc to aid in N1
determination and engine-out recognition 2) evaluate the addition of the "red
box" graphic to aid in engine-out recognition and 3) evaluate scale markings as
an aid for setting target N1 and fuel flow values. The first test involved
presentation of one of four engine format variants to the subjects for 75 to
360 milliseconds. Subjects reported N1 and any engine that might be shutdown.
The addition of the grey filled arc and red box had a significant effect on N1
determination. The grey filled arc did not improve engine out recognition but
the red box did. Addition of grey arcs to all gauges showed no significant
improvement over having that feature on N1 alone. In the second test subjects
set a target fuel flow or N1 value for 4 engines in the shortest time possible
with and without scale markings. The addition of scale markings significantly
improved time to set target N1.

%X The objective of this study was to investigate the role of individual
differences in pilot perceptual abilities on their experience of head-up
display (HUD) clutter during a simulated instrument approach. Pilot contrast
sensitivity, useful field of view (UFOV) and field dependence were assessed
using standardized instruments. When these measures were included in a model of
perceived clutter based on pilot subjective ratings of HUD configurations in
terms of display clarity, contrast, density and similarity of elements, the
predictive utility of the model modestly increased. Contrast sensitivity was
found to be the most influential perceptual ability, with UFOV also being a
predictor of perceived clutter. High contrast sensitivity for higher spatial
frequencies was associated with higher ratings of overall clutter, while
greater contrast sensitivity for moderate spatial frequencies was associated
with lower ratings of clutter. Better performance on the UFOV measure of
divided attention ability was associated with lower ratings of clutter, while
better performance on the selective attention processing speed scale was
related to higher clutter ratings. However, these variables had a much smaller
degree of influence on clutter ratings than contrast sensitivity.

%X An exploratory study was conducted to evaluate construction of synthetic
imagery, presented in a binocular, stereoscopic, see-through head-mounted
display (HMD) for depicting obstacles commonly encountered in helicopter
operations. In Phase 1, participants examined still images to identify
obstacles from graphics depicting two levels of ground-plane representation and
three levels of object complexity (depth). They then rated the depictions and
responded to perspective-view still images of an obstacle field, indicating
which areas corresponded with obstruction-free locations. Context played a
major role in identifying obstructions, and presence of guy-wire references was
important, both for identification of towers and of areas in the forward view
that would be free from obstructions. Preliminary flight-simulator trials
indicate pilots having experience with power-line flying interpret the
representations literally and not schematically or generically.

%X Cockpit noise, flight workload, and hearing loss all likely influence U.S.
Army pilot performance; however, hearing loss flight waiver decisions are
largely based on audiometric evaluation results. Twenty Army helicopter pilots
(two hearing level groups) participated in this study. The pilots flew three
flights in a full motion-base Black Hawk helicopter simulator, each involving a
different headset configuration as well as varying flight workload levels and
varying communication signal quality in a counterbalanced ordering. Objective
flight performance parameters of heading, altitude, and airspeed deviation and
air traffic control (ATC) command readbacks and subjective measures of workload
and situation awareness were measured. Results support a conclusion that
factors other than hearing thresholds and speech intelligibility in a quiet
environment should be considered when evaluating Army helicopter pilots' flight
safety with regard to hearing sensitivity. Results also support a
recommendation that hearing-impaired pilots use assistive communication
technology and not rely on passive-attenuation headsets worn over foam
earplugs.

from different types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may affect the
efficiency level of using such machines. This work follows our previous studies
on the type (e.g. size) of displays required by dismounted soldiers to process
video feed from UAVs. Twenty two former infantry soldiers with no experience
using UAV video feed participated. Three displays were examined using two video
feed types (MALE and Mini UAVs) in four different task types (description,

significant effect for the interaction between video feed type and task type

%X The Federal Aviation Administration is implementing the Next Generation of
Air Transportation Systems, with greater reliance on surface surveillance
sensors to provide a virtual representation to controllers of ground activity,
reducing the need for controllers to look out-the-window (OTW). This study
investigated how presently available technology can be used as a virtual
control tower by the controller workforce. Thirty-two human-in-the-loop
scenarios were conducted in an air traffic control tower simulator with
different equipment configurations and under different operating conditions.
Six recently retired controllers participated. Team performance on airport
operations was comparable when surface surveillance information was provided,
with or without the OTW view under good visibility. Advantages were found for
surface surveillance when visibility was reduced. Mental workload was lower
when surface surveillance was available under low visibility conditions, and
reliance on radio communications also decreased. Subjective ratings indicate
that controllers are most comfortable using some combination of existing
technology and procedures for adapting to a virtual tower. The results are
discussed with respect to future systems for controllers.

%X Data communication (Data Comm) between controllers and pilots is one of the
core initiatives in the development of the Federal Aviation Administration's
(FAA's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). We evaluated the
effect of the following factors on Data Comm: human-machine interfaces, the
proportion of Data Comm equipped aircraft in the sector, and data-communication
failures. Our experimental results showed that controllers preferred the most
flexible human-machine interface, the Combined mode. The significant
contribution of Data Comm occurred at the equipage level of over 50%. The Data
Comm failure by an individual aircraft did not give a noticeably negative
effect, but partial and system-wide failures did. Data Comm would relieve some
of controllers' activities, but it will add new tasks and force them to change
their work habits. Our experimental results and concerns presented in this
paper will help the FAA design an efficient Data Comm system and a training
program.

presented as an effective means to functionally evolve a decision support
system. The case study used to illustrate this method is the evaluation of the
Route Availability Planning Tool (RAPT), a decision support tool to improve
departure efficiency in convective weather in New York air traffic facilities.
It was only through a combination of quantitative performance data analysis and
field observation to identify key elements of the decision making process that
the designers were able to determine the most critical departure management
decision requiring support, leading to significant improvements in departure
efficiency.

%X Current air traffic control target symbols are holdover designs developed
for obsolete display technology to depict radar surveillance uncertainty. Given
new technological capabilities and new surveillance techniques, it is time to
reexamine the target symbology for a new generation of air traffic control
displays. Symbicons (Smallman, St. John, Oonk, and Cowen, 2001a, 2001b) are a
combination of icons and symbols that code meaningful information using
simplified visual coding. This assessment focuses on creating and evaluating
novel designs for target symbicons for Terminal Radar Approach Control displays
while incorporating human factors standards and best practices. In this study,
we evaluated different candidate symbicons that conveyed information such as
aircraft category and aircraft conformance. We examined the heuristics
controllers use that make certain symbicons better candidates to represent
different aircraft categories. We discuss the almost universal agreement among
the controllers for the tested aircraft conformance symbicons.

%X The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is an ambitious
enterprise that promises to transform the national air transportation system by
2025. One hallmark of NextGen is the use of data, instead of voice,
communications. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Planning and
Operations Office (AJP-6), Concept Development &amp; Validation group (AJP-66)
has been working with government, industry, and academia leaders to test the
efficiency, safety, and usability of data communications via human-in-the-loop

%X The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has embarked on a large effort to
create the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will
prepare the National Airspace System to accept increasing air traffic levels
and complexity in a safe and efficient manner. Data Communications (Data Comm)
is one of the core technologies of NextGen. The use of Data Comm will improve
information exchange between pilots and air traffic controllers. In 2009, the
FAA conducted three human-in-the-loop experiments to address the use of Data
Comm in the Airport Traffic Control Tower, the Terminal Radar Approach Control,
and the En Route airspace. The experiments focused on human factors aspects of
air traffic control tasks under a variety of conditions including varying
percentages of aircraft equipped for Data Comm, different interface designs,
and changes in roles of responsibilities of air traffic controllers.

%X This paper, to accompany a discussion panel, describes a collaborative FAA
and NASA research study to determine the effect Data Communications (Data Comm)
messages have on flight crew workload and eye scanning behavior in busy
terminal area operations. In the Next Generation Air Transportation System
Concept of Operations, for the period 2017-2022, the FAA envisions Data Comm
between controllers and the flight crew to become the primary means of
communicating non-time critical information. Four research conditions were
defined that span current day to future equipage levels (Voice with Paper map,
Data Comm with Paper map, Data Comm with Moving Map Display with ownship
position displayed, Data Comm with Moving Map, ownship and taxi route
displayed), and were used to create arrival and departure scenarios at Boston
Logan Airport. Preliminary results for workload, situation awareness, and pilot
head-up time are presented here. Questionnaire data indicated that pilot
acceptability, workload, and situation awareness ratings were favorable for all
of the conditions tested. Pilots did indicate that there were times during
final approach and landing when they would prefer not to hear the message
chime, and would not be able to make a quick response due to high priority
tasks in the cockpit.

%X This experiment sought to gain insight into the potential loss of
situational awareness that could arise from the switch from radio-based verbal
communications between pilots and controllers to the delivery of
non-time-critical information through data communications (Data Comm).
Specifically, this study examined the effect that loss of the party line and
changes to the delivery format for clearances and other flight-relevant
information had on pilot situational awareness and workload. Data suggest that
both the loss of the party line and the use of Data Comm as a delivery
mechanism for clearances affected performance and workload.

%X One aspect of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is
using datalink communications rather than voice. To encourage aircraft owners
and operators to invest in the technology necessary for datalink, the FAA has
proposed switching from a "first-come, first-served" to "best-equipped,
best-served" air traffic management strategy (Federal Aviation Administration,
2009). The purpose of this study was to present the datalink concept and the
"service for equipage" strategy to current stakeholders and to elicit their
opinions on the matter. Eight current air traffic controllers, two pilots, and
one Airline Operations Center dispatcher were presented with four scenarios to
discuss in a focus group. The results indicated several conditions under which
controllers would use datalink.

%X Loss of grip strength due to aging has been widely reported by researchers
but other factors may also be influential in age-related hand function
declines. For instance, older adults have demonstrated a propensity to orient
fingertip forces in a manner different from younger adults. Additionally, a
slowing in the maximal rate of force development due to aging has been found in
muscle groups ranging from the biceps to the quadriceps. These grip
characteristics may independently, or concurrently, affect hand function. Using
the Multi-axis (MAP) dynamometer, we evaluated the ability of younger and older
adult female participants to rapidly generate a maximal voluntary grip
exertion. The maximum grip force, rate of force development (N/sec) and grip
force vector orientation were measured. Older female participants had 69% the
grip force, 62% the rate of force development, and had grip force vector
orientations shifted 5.9 degrees as compared to younger female participants.
The ability to use one's hands is critical for completing activities of daily
living and retaining independence. The differences in grip characteristics
measured in this study may improve our understanding of the loss of function in
older adults' hands more than the decline in grip strength alone.

%X Older Mexican American adults have greater difficulty in performing
activities of daily living (ADL) compared to other older adult groups.
Differences in functional upper extremity anthropometry measures may help
explain higher incidences of ADL difficulties among older Mexican American
adults. Hence, as a first step, the objectives of this study were to compare
baseline limiting outer fingertip and grip reaches of older Mexican Americans
with published and available functional anthropometry data from other older
adult groups. Older Mexican American females and males, aged 60-85+, recruited
from Senior Centers in the City of El Paso, participated in the study. Stature,
vertical fingertip and grip reaches, and horizontal fingertip and grip reaches,
among other dimensions, were measured. Summary statistics, percentiles, and
correlations between dimensions were generated for elderly Mexican American
females and males. For overall comparison of Mexican American older adult
anthropometry with other older adult groups, data available from several other
studies in the Older Adult Data compendium was used. Overall comparisons of
weighted means of available reach dimensions between older Mexican Americans
and other older adult groups showed significant differences in most functional
reach dimensions. Older Mexican American adults were found to have
significantly different functional anthropometry than other groups.

%X One-third of the elderly population falls one or more times annually. Older
adults are more susceptible to falling and are more susceptible to serious
injury. Falls are the greatest killer of those 75 years of age and older.
Additionally, active older women, compared to active older men, are more likely
to fall and are twice as likely to experience serious injury from a fall.
Methods used to prepare individuals to avoid falls -- from an economic point
with no consideration for the emotional cost -- are break-even at best when
comparing the cost of preventing a fall to the medical costs of a resultant
fall. This paper reports on a 10- month intervention study of 121 women, 65
years of age and older, to determine whether a low-cost repetitive intervention
consisting of visualization and repetition would decrease the occurrence of
falls. In the study, the number of falls in the treatment group, excluding
repeat fallers, was less (11%) than the control group although not to a level
of statistical significance. Nevertheless, benefits were gained from the study.
The women almost exclusively reported that their awareness to hazardous
situations was heightened by the study and some reported changing their
approach to hazardous situations in order to decrease their exposure to harm.
There is some indication that to be most effective, a fall intervention program
should be ongoing to the extent as permitted by economic considerations.
Suggestions for future study are included.

%X A new driving simulator task was developed with the long-term goal of aiding
rehabilitation specialists who work with drivers who may have functional
impairments. This simulated driving task was designed to measure a driver's
ability to respond to two types of visual stimuli -- brake lights of a lead
vehicle and targets presented at different eccentricities along the horizon.
Three driving scenarios were developed for the study. The first two were used
to examine the effect of A-pillar occlusion on the target detection task. The
target locations used in the third scenario were chosen to examine the effect
of eccentricity on target reaction time when the participant was required to
make head movements to locate and respond to targets. This third scenario
revealed age-related differences in the capability to locate and respond to
visual stimuli in the periphery of the driving environment. This may be due to
the decrements in psychomotor ability observed in older adults. This scenario
is expected to have utility in clinical settings.

%X Because there are age-related perceptual, motor, and cognitive declines and
because people are living longer, there has been increased concern about older
drivers' ability to operate motor vehicles safely. This research examined older
and younger adults' perceptions regarding a set of 28 motor vehicle
features/aspects according to the extent to which they believed it may help
their safe driving. Several features were judged as more important than others
regarding safe driving. Although both age groups predominately gave similar
evaluations, some features/aspects differed significantly between the two age
groups. Older adults believed that vehicle door openings should be easier to
get into and out of, preferred analog displays, and labels on the dashboard
that were bigger and brighter, and held less strong beliefs that current
vehicle controls and displays are easy to use than did younger adults.
Implications and design recommendations are discussed. A list of vehicle
features that are potentially beneficial to older drivers is presented.

%X Age differences in the performance of two prospective memory tasks
(activity-based and event-based) were investigated both in laboratory and
naturalistic settings. Forty young and 40 older adults participated. First, the
participants came to the lab and answered ninety trivia questions with embedded
prospective memory tasks. Second, they were required to come to a local mall
(naturalistic setting) a few days later to complete various prospective memory
tasks. Results indicated that both age groups performed the event-based task
followed by activity-based task better in the lab than in the naturalistic
setting. The young performed the tasks better than their older counterparts in
both contexts, though the effects failed to reach statistical significance. An
interesting finding was that older participants performed the naturalistic
event-based task better than the young participants. These findings suggest
that converting activity-based tasks into event-based tasks may help people
accomplish their daily prospective memory tasks more successfully.

%X Older adult drivers' disproportionate involvement in traffic fatalities
coupled with growing population projections for this age group present a need
for public policy that regulates the safety of our roadways. Before such a
policy can be developed, a highly predictive model of the cognitive factors
responsible for successful driving performance is necessary. The present study
investigated the relationship between age and cognitive control on simulated
driving performance to develop a predictive model for individual driving
ability. Visual attention and working memory capacity of young adult college
students and community dwelling older adults were tested using Useful Field of
View and Operation Span which are thought to measure aspects of attention.
These scores were correlated with participants' simulated driving performance.
Preliminary results indicated that attentional measures are important
predictors of driving performance. Results are discussed in terms of
implications for public policy related to driving and aging.

%X Various factors, including trust, system reliability, and error type have
been found to affect how people interact with automated systems. Another
variable that is becoming increasingly important is the role of age in
human-automation interaction. As automation continues to emerge in numerous
domains, including the home, older adults will likely interact with these types
of systems to a greater extent than ever before. Therefore, understanding if
age-related changes in cognition, such as diminished working memory capacity or
processing speed, affect how older adults use automated systems is critical to
ensure these systems are designed and implemented effectively. This study
examined the role of age in a simulated dual task environment using an
automated aid. Younger adults outperformed older adults in both tasks. When the
automation was incorrect, younger adults exhibited less dependence than older
adults. Further, when older adults verified the automation's suggestion, they
took significantly more time to do so than younger adults. Additionally, older
adults reported greater trust in the automation and higher workload compared to
younger adults.

necessary to learn a new task (cf. (Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992; Van Merrienboer
&amp; Sweller, 2005). Some argue less feedback is beneficial in acquisition as
it provides conditions similar to those needed for retention (Schmidt &amp;
Bjork, 1992); others advocate more feedback will reduce the cognitive load of
the learner thus freeing up the resources needed for learning (McLaughlin,
2007; McLaughlin, Rogers, &amp; Fisk, 2006; Sweller, 1988). To test the model
feedback requirements are determined by the cognitive resources of the learner
and the demands imposed by the task (McLaughlin et al., 2006), a simple
cue-based learning exercise was created. Cognitive resources was controlled for
by using participants with documented declines in cognitive resources, older
adults (Horn &amp; Cattell, 1967; Salthouse &amp; Babcock, 1991). Results
indicated feedback requirements for a cue that drew from fluid abilities
differed from a cue that drew from crystallized intelligence suggesting
feedback requirements may be based on individual ability levels. Theoretical
and applied contributions are also discussed.

%X Neurophysiologic synchronies (NS) are the second-by-second co-expression of
the levels of cognitive measures by individual members of a team. Previously we
showed that the NS obtained from EEG-derived measures of engagement (EEG-E)
were not random across a variety of teamwork situations, but changed with
changing task demands. In this study we hypothesized that the expression of
different NS may represent unobserved states of the team and that the sequence
of NS expression may contain long memory relevant to the performance of the
team. To test this hypothesis we performed hidden Markov modeling of the EEG-E
NS streams from novice and expert Navy submarine piloting and navigation teams
and show that the dynamic expression of states derived from these models
identified short and long-term changes in the behavior of teams.

%X Automating tasks alleviates operator resources to be delegated to other
demands, but the cost is often situation awareness. In contrast, complete
manual control of a system opens the door for greater human error. Therefore,
an ideal situation would require the development of an adaptive system in which
automation can be triggered based on performance of a particular task, time
spent on the task, or perhaps physiological response. The latter pertains to
the goal for this particular study. Electroencephalogram (EEG),
electrocardiogram (ECG), and eye tracking measures were recorded during six
multi-tasking scenarios to assess if any one single measure is best suited for
future implementation as an automation invocation. EEG showed the greatest
potential for that purpose.

%X Electroencephalography (EEG) has the prospect of providing a means to gauge
operator workload in a manner that does not intrude on the task being
performed. Specifically, it has been proposed that the technique could be used
as a method to speed the learning of a task, by adjusting the task to suit the
state of the learner. The present study recorded EEG while participants
performed a simulated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reconnaissance task.
Analysis of power in three EEG frequency bands of interest found differences
between the types of task being performed; however more complex analysis may be
necessary to discern levels of difficulty within the task.

%X Objective: This study was designed to identify potential neurophysiologic
markers and patterns of mental fatigue among air traffic controllers in their
work environment. Background: The monitoring of mental fatigue in air traffic
controllers has been of interest as their tasks involve high cognitive workload
and are also critical to the safety of the public. Method: High-density
electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to record 2-hour long air traffic control
studies in eleven participants. Participants were asked to perform realistic
tasks in a simulation, to operate a virtual air traffic control system. Fourier
Transforms were used to estimate EEG power spectrum, statistical tests were
implemented to reveal EEG spatial pattern changes caused by the time-on-task.
The concept of mental state transition was introduced to study the development
of certain mental states which are related to the mental fatigue. Results: The
observation of EEG spectral data over a period of time revealed statistically
significant changes spatially localized to central and parietal cortices.
Rhythmic EEG activity within theta, alpha, and beta bands indicates transitions
among mental states, which appear to be promising indicators for the
development of mental fatigue. Mental fatigue indicated by the transition of
mental states was estimated to approximately 70 minutes after the time on task.
Application: This study can build the foundation to develop promising
technologies for real time monitoring of mental fatigue, which will increase
public safety and proper human resource planning.

%X Advances in state-of-the-art dry electrode technology have led to the
development of a novel dry electrode system for electroencephalography (QUASAR,
Inc.; San Diego, California, USA). While basic systems-level testing and
comparison of this dry electrode system to conventional wet electrode systems
has proved to be very favorable, very limited data has been collected that
demonstrates the ability of QUASAR's dry electrode system to replicate results
produced in more applied, dynamic testing environments that may be used for
human factors applications. In this study, QUASAR's dry electrode headset was
used in combination with traditional wet electrodes to determine the ability of
the dry electrode system to accurately differentiate between varying levels of
cognitive workload. Results show that the accuracy in cognitive workload
assessment obtained with wet electrodes is comparable to that obtained with the
dry electrodes.

faced with the dilemma of merging laboratory results into applicable systems,
i.e. developing and applying real-time physiological measures to integrate into
human-computer systems. Insight to that disparity might be gleaned by
revisiting this age-old debate of whether basic and applied research operate at
opposite ends of the spectrum or perhaps on a more narrowed continuum. A few
items to be addressed include a solution between the two camps, methods for
bridging the gaps between laboratory and field experiments and then to advanced
development, and the importance of mediation occurring within knowledge and
practice. The panelists are challenged to make recommendations for
investigators in augmented cognition and related fields to overcome the
limitations of working in a controlled laboratory or a field environment and to

%X Conventional personality questionnaires are often only weak predictors of
operational performance. A major problem is that personality effects are
moderated by contextual factors which may be mismatched across laboratory and
real-world studies. Context mismatch threatens the 'functional fidelity' of
laboratory performance tasks; the extent to which the individual behaves as
they would in the operational environment. Three research strategies for
enhancing the functional fidelity of laboratory studies of individual
differences are proposed. First, contexts relevant to specific personality
traits may be developed in the laboratory. For example, socially threatening
environments may be necessary to find meaningful effects of neuroticism.
Second, traits linked to a specific performance context may be employed. The
validity of traits for driver stress vulnerability supports this approach.
Third, psychophysiological responses to simulations of the cognitive demands of
the work environment may be used. Our recent work shows that stress and
hemodynamic responses to short high-workload tasks predict longer duration
sustained performance.

overcome the limitations of traditional SDT, 2) Provide basic empirical support
to validate the adequacy of the model, and 3) Show the potential
generalizability of the model to different domain-specific areas within applied
settings. The results from the basic empirical study suggest that the a-b SDT
model provides a more accurate theoretical framework for examining the
underlying processes involved in signal detection and decision making.
Furthermore, the findings from the domain-specific study show the potential
applicability and generalizability of the a-b SDT model for examining
human-automation interaction. The end product of this work is particularly
important for researchers and practitioners who are interested in applying a
basic fundamental framework for examining how sensory, perceptual, and
cognitive factors may affect humans' decision-making accuracy and response bias
while interacting with automated systems in a wide range of applied settings.

%X Human Factors (HF), or ergonomics, is the scientific discipline concerned
with the interactions among humans and built systems. Because human factors
research is transparently applied, HF researchers often find themselves in a
supposed tug-of-war between the basic and applied scientific research
communities. We provide an argument in this paper that there really is no
meaningful distinction between basic and applied science. We provide two
historical examples, one medieval and one modern, demonstrating that a
fundamental impetus of all psychological research has always been application.
Human Factors is not unique in this respect. We suspect the basic-applied
distinction has been propagated to suppress scientists' wages and provide some
parting advice to HF researchers in dealing with this issue.

%X Previous research has demonstrated that the level of performance achieved
for a given workload level is affected not only on task demands and individual
differences, but also by sequential effects of prior workload. The majority of
this research has been done with vigilance-type tasks, wherein performance is
an intermittent response to critical signals. Workload is then varied either by
adjusting the signal rate or adding a secondary task. This study sought to
demonstrate that workload can be assessed with Transcranial Doppler (TCD) in
addition to performance and other physiological measures, and that workload
transition results generalize to more complex tasks. TCD and
electrocardiographic (ECG) data were collected while participants performed the
Multi Attribute Task Battery (MATB, Comstock &amp; Arnegard, 1992). Two levels
of workload were individually defined based on performance via a pretest
calibration procedure; one level was relatively easy with a mean composite TLX
score of 23 and the other relatively difficult with a mean composite TLX score
of 63. These two levels were run in isolation and in transition runs that
switched from one to the other halfway through. TCD and ECG revealed that both
blood flow velocity and heart rate increased with increasing task difficulty,
while the transition in task difficulty produced non-significantly lower
performance than runs of consistent difficulty. The physiological data provides
evidence that additional physical resources are demanded and consumed in
response to the change in task difficulty, while performance data collected to
date has not revealed transition effects in the complex task.

%X Previous work has explored the possibility of measuring the functional state
of the operator to drive the implementation of physiological adaptive aiding.
Transcranial Doppler Sonography (TCD), which has shown promise as an index of
cognitive resource utilization in vigilance or sustained attention tasks, may
provide a time and cost efficient alternative to traditional measures used to
assess operator functional state. In the current study, participants performed
a command and control simulation under varying levels of task load: a low task
load condition in which enemy threats incurred at a steady pace, and a high
workload trial in which the number of enemy threats increased unpredictably at
two points within the scenario. Reaction time to engage and destroy enemies,
and the efficiency of protection of a no-fly zone, were superior in the low
than in the high load condition. Furthermore, an automated decision aid
facilitated better performance in both task load conditions. As the demands of
the task increased unpredictably in the high task load condition, cerebral
blood flow velocity (CBFV) increased in a similar manner for the first task
load transition, but not for the second. Results suggest that the TCD measure
may be useful in monitoring the dynamic changes of operator workload in
unpredictable environments, but additional studies are needed to validate its
use for physiologically-driven adaptive automation.

pupil diameter (PD) measures, we utilized a dual-axis pursuit tracking task
where the control mappings repeatedly and abruptly rotated 90&deg; throughout
the trials to provide an immediate and obvious challenge to proper system
control. Using these data, a model-building technique novel to these measures,
genetic programming (GP) with scaled symbolic regression and Age Layered
Populations (ALPS), was compared to traditional linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) for predicting tracking error and control-mapping state. When compared
with traditional linear modeling approaches, symbolic regression better
predicted both tracking error and control mapping state. Furthermore, the
estimates obtained from symbolic regression were less noisy and more robust.

respiration and pupillometry were measured during task completion along with
subjective reports of motivation and effort. Results showed sensitivity to
demand for all EEG measures, blood pressure and heart rate variability (0.1Hz

%X Accidents in the process industries can be attributed, at least in part, to
human causes. Hazard studies are commonly used in industry to identify and
manage risks. This paper describes a methodology, called HumHID, which
potentially improves hazard identification associated with human factors. The
approach is based on cognitive work analysis (CWA) techniques, human
factors/error taxonomies and the blended hazard methodology (BLHAZID). A
desktop case study is used to illustrate the application of the methodology.
The results show that a combination of CWA, human factors/error taxonomies and
BLHAZID techniques provides a structured means of identifying hazards
associated with human activity as well as showing the causality behind the
hazards which can be used to guide redesign work.

%X Cognitive work analysis (CWA) is a relatively new human factors perspective
for analyzing complex sociotechnical systems. However, it does not yet have
specific tools and techniques that allow it to address teamwork explicitly
enough to provide good guidance on how to support teams and collaboration. In
this paper, Decision Wheels are introduced as an extension to the Decision
Ladders for representing collaboration in teamwork environments. This extension
would be a significant contribution to both CWA methodology and human factors
methods for team situations. It would enable human factors practitioners to
understand the cognitive work of teams better, and to design better
collaborative systems for teamwork environments.

%X Cyber Network degradation and exploitation can covertly turn an
organization's technological strength into an operational weakness. It has
become increasingly imperative, therefore, for an organization's personnel to
have an awareness of the state of the Cyber Network that they use to carry out
their mission. Recent high-level government initiatives along with hacking and
exploitation in the commercial realm highlight this need for general Cyber
Situational Awareness (SA). While much of the attention in both the military
and commercial cyber security communities is on abrupt and blunt attacks on the
network, the most insidious cyber threat to organizations are subtle and
persistent attacks leading to compromised databases, processing algorithms, and
displays. We recently began an effort developing software tools to support the
Cyber SA of users at varying levels of responsibility and expertise (i.e., not
just the network administrators). This paper presents our approach and
preliminary findings from a CTA we conducted with an operational Subject Matter
Expert to uncover the situational awareness requirements of such a tool.
Results from our analysis indicate a list of preliminary categories of these
requirements, as well as specific questions that will drive the design and
development of our SA tool.

%X Minerals Industry Safety and Health Centre and Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral
Research Centre (JKMRC) Sustainable Minerals Institute, The University of
Queensland, St Lucia, Australia Mineral processing plants present a complex and
dynamic process control environment where human operation is widely regarded as
the bottleneck of overall plant performance. This paper presents an initial
field study to investigate factors and issues that affect successful human
performance in this domain from human factors perspective. The methods used
were in-situ observation, interviews, survey and review of documentation. A
total of 20 operators were studied at two different types of Australian mineral
processing plants. The results indicate 1) current information in the control
room was not effectively organized and presented in a way that supported human
supervisory control activities, and 2) various organizational issues such as
insufficient operator training and poor shift handover significantly impacted
the quality of human control. As a result, human control inevitably fell into a
typical passive mode. Even worse, controllers often distrusted or rejected the
use of alarms and new technologies in their work place. This work demonstrates
the successful case study of applying human factor research methods in a novel
domain. The outcome of this field study has successfully stimulated new
industry interest and support for further research aimed at improving human and
system integration.

%X There is renewed interest in building new commercial nuclear power plants.
Unlike existing plants that have traditional control rooms with large control
boards, new plants will have compact digital control rooms. The transition to
digital control rooms introduce opportunities for enhanced support (e.g.,
integrated displays; improved alarm systems; computerized procedures) as well
as potential new challenges (e.g., shift from open to private workspaces;
changes in workload distribution resulting from reduced control room crew
size). This paper describes two simulator tests that were conducted as part of
a person-in-the-loop test program to support development and validation of a
control room for the US-APWR evolutionary pressurized water reactor plant.
While the results are presented in the context of evaluation of a particular
digital control room design, they have applicability to design of compact
digital control rooms more generally, and point to areas where more research is
needed.

that other research methodologies do not. But the complexity and richness of
the results they afford in human factors research is matched by the complexity
and cost of their conception, design, implementation, and validation. Though
this may seem a daunting challenge to those considering such platforms for
their own research, this panel aims to air the promises and pitfalls of
simulations and games by sharing historical exemplars, lessons learned, and
current issues in their use for human factors research. The panelists represent
decades of experience in military, medical, and civilian research domains and
have worked through abundant successes and failures in this area. Key issues of
discussion will include cases which stand out as exemplary instances of using
simulations and games in human factors research, particularly those that
produced results that would have been unattainable by other methods, the
challenges and constraints of participant pools (e.g. na&iuml;ve subjects,
access to domain experts, and suitable compromises), development of viable and
engaging simulations (e.g., the problem of software written by grad students,
for grad students), collection of accurate and meaningful data, and the
generalizability of such game and simulation platforms as well as the
adaptability of off-the-shelf solutions.

%X Cognitive workload effects behavior like squeezing a balloon. If you squeeze
at one place, it pops out at another, and it is hard to predict where it's
going to pop out. Understanding workload requires understanding the control of
cognition at the 1/3 to 3s-time span during which cognitive, perceptual, and
motor operations become bound together into interactive routines. Interactive
routines constitute unit tasks (3 to 30 s), and unit tasks constitute subtasks
(30s to 3min). To reduce cognitive workload and overload, the Functional
Resource Hypothesis maintains that an optimal allocation of interactive
routines to task performance would be based on the functional resource of time
not modality. Some of the implications of this hypothesis are investigated in
an empirical study that varied memory load as well as the demands on the eyes,
visual attention, auditory cognition, and motor operations. A microanalysis of
the data revealed tradeoffs between groups in their pattern of resource
allocation that were compatible with the Functional Resource Hypothesis and led
to surprising behavioral effects.

%X Humans interacting with robots face a complex task. Often the exchanges are
mediated through an interface and impact the workload associated with a
particular task. Within a human-robot system, an operator's perceived workload
is very important. Effective workload measurement strategies are needed to
ensure optimal human-robot interaction. Building upon traditional workload
measures, the development of the human-robot interaction workload measure is
introduced. The human-robot interaction workload measure provides several
advantages beyond traditional subjective workload measures while providing a
comprehensive account of the workload associated with human-robot systems.

%X In complex operational environments, such as found in the military, it is
necessary to consider not only the situation awareness (SA) of individual team
members, but also the SA of the team as a whole. Given their important role in
military combat operations, we hypothesized that the SA of team leaders (e.g.,
unit commanders) may have a significant influence on the SA and subsequent
performance of those under their command. Accordingly, the overall objective of
this research was to evaluate how much of the variance in a team's SA can be
accounted for by the individual SA of the team's leader. To test our
hypothesis, we performed an analysis of data collected at three experiments
involving complex military operations. Results highlight the significant role
of leaders' SA on their team's SA.

measuring and predicting shared situation awareness (SA) in teams performing in
complex operational environments. Participants were assigned to one of 4 teams
(Navy, Army, Special Operations, or Joint Service) and completed a simulated
military rescue operation training exercise. We developed procedures to measure
the degree of shared SA between team members and to improve the accuracy of
shared SA scores. The measures were then used to evaluate five potential
predictors of shared SA (experience similarity, shared task knowledge,
cognitive workload similarity, communication distance, organizational hub
distance). We examined the relationship of these factors to specific queries
that assessed different types of SA information requirements. Results indicated
that four factors had significant relationships with shared SA, but that the
factors related to each query changed in relation to the type of SA assessed by
the query. We discuss the implications of these results for predicting shared
SA under different situational conditions.

%X It is important for console operators to maintain good situation awareness
while monitoring process operations. A key component that helps operators
achieve better situation awareness is how the information about the process is
displayed on their console. Most oil and gas refineries still utilize
traditional schematic displays and connecting lines between equipments to
present process information. In this study, we designed a functional layout for
an overview display. This layout shows the same process parameters as a
traditional schematic display, but in a different format. Eighteen plant
operators viewed both displays to monitor a crude unit process and their
situation awareness was measured. Results indicated that operators' situation
awareness was significantly higher when they monitored the process on a
functional display compared with a schematic display. The implications of the
findings for continuous process control are discussed.

The majority of time, reliance on these heuristics helps us to perform
efficiently and effectively. Yet, this reliance can also promote bias, or
systematic error. Our review of the literature suggests that both
decision-making approaches that are rational and natural are likely to be
subject to a range of biases. Unfortunately, the available literature provides
very little discussion of what aspects biases are likely to impact within each
of these processes. In the absence of this discussion, we have attempted to
combine our knowledge of the bias literature and the decision-making literature
to explore what biases are likely to impact various components of each
decision-making process. Includes the following biases: availability,
representativeness, anchoring &amp; adjustment, confirmation, hindsight,
overconfidence, framing and affect.

training in a simulated airport security screening task using a 3 (frame:
analytical, affective, comparative) x 2 (incentive: positive, negative) x 4

sensitivities, and detection response times. Results indicate that participants
in the analytical frame (i.e., emphasis on gaining/losing points) outperformed
participants in both the affective (i.e., emphasis on saving/losing lives) and
comparative frames (i.e., emphasis on performing better/worse than peers).
These results have implications for training airport luggage screeners in the
real world in that eliciting strong emotions override our reason and logic and
lead participants to perform poorly in discriminating between signal and noise.

%X Introduction: In a cognitive system, human operators work with automation to
achieve their goal. However, there are times when the human operator cannot
interpret what the automation is doing. This can create dangerous communication
gap particularly if the automation provides the wrong advice. This paper
proposes the Motivation-Expectation Space (MES) as a representative structure
for bridging the gap. Review: The MES has its theoretical foundation from
research in Cognitive System Engineering. It represents the goals, means,
causes, and effects in an orthogonal structure. These four components were
repeatedly observed in research related to decision strategies. The MES was
assessed against the information requirements for improving automation trust
and dependency and found to suffice in supporting most of the requirements.
Contribution: The structured representation of these elements in the MES would
likely facilitate the interpretation of the decision strategies, making it
easier and faster for the human to understand what the automation is doing.
Parallels were also drawn between MES and Situation Awareness to suggest the
potential value MES can bring to research in Cognitive System Engineering.

%X Decision research has revealed a variety of adaptive strategies that experts
use when making decisions; however, there is no widely accepted model of how
experienced decision makers choose such a strategy to solve a particular
decision problem. Within most decision-making models that include a selection
mechanism, decision strategies are selected according to cost-benefit
trade-offs. These models assume that the selection is based on an evaluation of
the subjectively expected utility of a correct decision and the effort the
decision maker is willing to make in the situation at hand. In opposition,
there are research findings showing that proficient decision makers mainly seem
to select strategies based on recognition of the decision situation and a
history of successful applications of a certain strategy. In this context I
discuss findings from a field study in production planning and scheduling that
are contrary to predictions from cost-benefit models. In accordance with recent
scholarly work on routine decisions, I suggest that decision-strategy selection
mechanisms based on recognition are a valid theoretical background for the
design of future decision support systems. Accordingly, the cognitive
engineering focus would shift from accuracy maximization and effort reduction
to situational differentiation and strategy learning.

understanding of the tradeoffs between decisions and the facility to perform
what if analyses of alternatives. Set in the context of future combat systems,
the current study explored features of a robotic asset allocation decision for
a surveillance and reconnaissance task. Decision features explored included the
method of interaction with plan data, possible decision bias, and robustness
following a change in planning assumptions. Findings suggest that planning
decisions made from a predetermined set of optimal plans may be faster and more
effective than creating plans from scratch if the planning assumptions remain
constant. However, plans created from scratch may more deeply engage the
planner in the planning conditions, and consequently, result in plans that more
effectively handle changes in the planning assumptions.

%X Human perceptions of the "humanness" of robots have been found to be
influenced by face, voice and interactivity features. These features have been
studied individually in a human robot interaction (HRI) and facial features
appear to be strongest in promoting positive human emotions. The objective of
this study was to assess the effects of combined humanoid robot features on
human emotions during a medicine delivery task. Seven robot prototypes with
various combinations of face, voice and interactivity features were developed
and classified in terms of levels of humanness. A "Wizard of Oz" experiment was
conducted in which 32 subjects received and accepted a simulated bag of
medicine from each of the robot prototypes. Both subjective (arousal and
valence ratings) and physiological (HR and GSR) measures were collected as
indicators of participant emotional states. Results revealed robot
configurations with higher levels of humanness promoted positive emotions.
Arousal and valence ratings and the HR response had utility for predicting
emotions. We also found that additional humanoid features lead to higher GSR
ratings, but the trend was not strictly linear with the pre-defined level of
robot humanness.

%X The recognition-primed decision (RPD) model and Take the First (TTF)
heuristic assert that successful and experienced decision makers typically
generate relatively few options, and generate a satisficing, or the best,
option first. Moreover, the TTF heuristic suggests that as more options are
generated the likelihood that the best option will be selected is reduced. An
alternative proposal suggests that the ability to anticipate the outcome of a
situation is actually positively related to the number of options generated. To
test these opposing claims we compared high and low performing critical-care
nurses on three simulated critical care scenarios and measured their option
generation behaviors and the courses of action pursued. Consistent with RPD and
TTF, the data suggest that high performers generate fewer options than low
performers during situational assessment. However, counter to RPD and TTF, the
current data suggest that the selection of options generated later in the
process may actually facilitate better outcomes. Implications for the design of
instruction and training materials are discussed.

optimized system. Radiological imaging (x-rays, CT scans, etc) is unique in the
ED setting, as the need for fast turn-around time and interactive communication
between radiologists and emergency physicians is different than that of most
other healthcare settings. The information technology systems which are used by
both radiologists and emergency physicians to support these processes have been
designed with a focus on the routine workflow of radiologists. We report the
results of 14 hours of naturalistic observations of the use of digital imaging
systems by a total of 22 ED and radiology staff. A hierarchical task analysis
and an information process diagram are presented, and disparate theories that
groups in the system have about other groups were discovered, particularly in
the communication of clinical information.

Previous research has investigated the relationships between work system

parameters simultaneously, and how they affect multiple dimensions of fatigue.
This study used Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) to mine
work system parameters and their multiple interactions on perceptions of
mental, physical, and total fatigue dimensions in registered nurses. Results
showed that multiple work system parameters were associated with changes in
fatigue levels across mental, physical, and total fatigue dimensions. These
findings expand our understanding of the relationships between work system
parameters and fatigue and provide valuable information to improve the design
of nursing work systems, in order to retain qualified nursing personnel and
ultimately improve both patient- and provider safety.

%X System control is a challenge in many everyday activities and professional
contexts. Unfortunately, it is not clear how much of the cognitive demand of
controlling a system depends on the specific type of the system under control.
This question is especially important for comparisons between natural and
technical systems. The current study examines tracking performance and
cognitive demand when controlling different systems. Similar to Durso and Drews
(2010) we distinguish between natural and technical systems. Control
performance was evaluated using four different conditions that representing
aspects of different system types. Control performance was worst when
controlling a system that had features of a natural system, where control
performance of a technical system was best. Overall, the results of this study
indicate that the design of displays to support controllers in a wide range of
domains needs to specifically incorporate features that are specific to a
systems nature.

%X The study investigates how complacency and automation bias effects in
interaction with automated aids are moderated by system experience.
Participants performed a supervisory control task supported by an aid for fault
identification and management. Groups differed with respect to how long they
worked with the aid until eventually an automation failure occurred, and
whether this failure was the first or second one the participants were exposed
to. Results show that negative experiences, i.e., automation failures, entail
stronger effects on subjective trust in automation as well as the level of
complacency and automation bias than positive experiences (correct
recommendations of the aid). Furthermore, results suggest that commission
errors may be due to three different sorts of effects: (1) a withdrawal of
attention in terms of incomplete cross-checks of information, (2) an active
discounting of contradictory system information, and (3) an inattentive
processing of contradictory information analogue to a "looking-but-not-seeing"
effect.

%X Substantial automation will be needed to allow operators to control the
large teams of robots envisioned for search and rescue, perimeter patrol, and a
wide variety of military tasks. Both analysis and research point to navigation
and path planning as prime candidates for automation. When operators are
isolated from robot navigation, however, there may be loss of situation
awareness (SA) and difficulties in monitoring robots for failures or abnormal
behavior. Operator's navigational strategies are quite complex and extremely
changeable at foraging tasks in unknown environment reflecting background
knowledge and expectations about human and natural environments. These
considerations are missing from automated path planning algorithms leading to
differences in search patterns and exploration biases between human and
automatically generated paths. Effectively integrating automated path planning
into multirobot systems would require demonstrating that: 1-automated path
planning performs as well as humans on measures such as area coverage and 2-
use of automated path planning does not degrade performance of related human
tasks such as finding and marking victims. In this paper we seek to compare the
divergence between human manual control and autonomous path planning at an
urban search and rescue (USAR) task using fractal analysis to characterize the
paths generated by the two methods. Area coverage and human contributions to
mixed-initiative planning are compared with fully automated path planning.
Finally, the impact of automated planning on related victim identification and
marking tasks is compared for automated paths and paths generated by previous
participants.

%X In this paper we look at a study that examines how expert problem solving
behavior changes when computer software, specifically the math software package
Maple, is used to help in the problem solving process. We examine two
theoretical frameworks, naturalistic decision making and distributed cognition,
that help us draw out conclusions from our observations of the participants'
behavior. Our study involved the observation and recording of problem solving
sessions where the participants were sometimes provided with software to assist
with the problem solving. We observed that the high level strategies that the
participants used when the software was available were often the same as when
the software was not available. This led us to the conclusion that encouraging
new users of the software to continue to use their old problem solving
strategies while learning the software is a valid way of managing cognitive
load during the learning process while not impeding the new users from learning
to use the software efficiently and effectively.

%X Function allocation between human and automation can be represented in terms
of the stages &amp; levels taxonomy proposed by Parasuraman, Sheridan &amp;
Wickens (2000). Higher degrees of automation (DOA) are achieved both by later
stages (e.g., automation decision aiding rather than diagnostic aiding) and
higher levels within stages (e.g. executing a choice unless vetoed, versus
offering the human several choices). A meta analysis based on data of 14
experiments examines the mediating effects of DOA on routine system
performance, performance when the automation fails, workload and situation
awareness. The effects of DOA on these four measures are summarized by level of
statistical significance. We found: (1) an inverse relationship between routine
performance and workload as automation is introduced and DOA increases. (2) a
weak positive relationship between routine performance and failure performance,
as mediated by DOA. (3) A strong mediating role of situation awareness in
improving both routine and failure performance.

%X Resilience is a complex of behaviours seen in complex work systems, whereby
they are able to largely meet their fundamental goals despite threats and
challenges to their work and even their existence. It is not something a system
has, but rather something a system does. Because resilient behaviour (or lack
thereof) is manifested over time, the dynamics of resilience are of interest.
Studies of resilience to date have been largely descriptive, but understanding
of how resilient performance comes about, and especially how we might enhance
it, or recognize that a system is losing it, has been difficult. This work uses
system dynamics models to develop inductively a theory of activities resulting
in resilient performance in complex systems, and to elaborate on previous
representations of system resilience. Such models might be useful in two ways:
explaining how resilient behaviours observed might come about; and exploring
the temporal dynamics of changes in state (for example, suggesting leading
rather than lagging indicators of performance).

%X Automation is ubiquitous in modern complex systems, and commercial
nuclear-power plants are no exception. Automation is applied to a wide range of
functions, including monitoring and detection, situation assessment, response
planning, and response implementation. Automation has become a "team player"
supporting personnel in nearly all aspects of system operation. In light of its
increasing use and importance in new- and future-plants, guidance is needed to
conduct safety reviews of the operator's interface with automation. The
objective of this research was to develop such guidance. We first characterized
the important HFE aspects of automation, including six dimensions: Levels,
functions, processes, modes, flexibility, and reliability. Next, we reviewed
literature on the effects of all of these aspects of automation on human
performance, and on the design of human-system interfaces (HSIs). Then, we used
this technical basis established from the literature to identify general
principles for human-automation interaction and to develop review guidelines.
The guidelines consist of the following seven topics: Automation displays,
interaction and control, automation modes, automation levels, adaptive
automation, error tolerance and failure management, and HSI integration.

%X Typically, interface design attempts to minimize cognitive load by providing
immediately accessible task-relevant information. However, this may have the
unintended consequence of encouraging display-based strategies that minimize
the degree of cognitive processing; a claim made by the soft constraints
hypothesis (Gray, Sims, Fu, &amp; Schoelles, 2006). Increasing information
access cost (IAC) induces a more memory-based strategy, and has been shown to
improve performance following interruption in a visuospatial copying task
(Morgan, Patrick, Waldron, King, &amp; Patrick, 2009). An experiment
investigates whether the positive effect of increased IAC on interrupted
performance extends to a problem solving task. A mouse movement and time delay
to access information provoked a strategy that facilitated resumption and
continuation of problem solving from memory, improved problem solving
efficiency, and added no extra time cost to problem completion. The findings
highlight the value of considering design solutions in light of the importance
of different task performance criteria.

%X Control applications involving multiple Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) will
often require the operator to switch attention between UASs and their
respective camera views. An automated aid that transitions between camera views
is under evaluation. Instead of discretely switching from the camera view for
one UAS to the camera view for another, a transition format is presented. With
this format, the camera imagery seamlessly fades into a synthetic imagery
correlate of the real video image and then uses a "fly-out, fly-in" metaphor
over several seconds, finishing with a transition back from synthetic to real
video imagery at the new camera viewpoint. The results from the present
simulation evaluation provide support that an automated camera view transition
aid can improve task performance and situation awareness. Moreover, the results
show potential benefits of allowing an operator to decide where and when the
fly-in segment starts.

maker through a multi-step decision process inspired by the recognition-primed
decision model and case-based reasoning theory; (b) a pattern recognition
engine that prompts the user for diagnostic information and retrieves similar
cases; and (c) a community-wide shared knowledge base of cases that grows as
the system is used. AlphaACT's objective is to train and enable responders in
crisis situations to think like experienced decision makers, and to quickly
build their store of available experiences. The first AlphaACT application
under development will support key decisions made by first responders managing
a hazardous materials emergency.

fielded numerous systems attempting to use computational technologies to
improve command and control of tactical operations. In reality, designers have
inadequately considered both the role of the human and the constraints of this
complicated work domain in the implementation of these systems. A prototype
interface (RAPTOR) was developed to leverage powerful perception-action skills,
thereby providing improved decision making and problem solving support. A
laboratory experiment was conducted using a synthetic task environment. Sixteen
US Army Officers participated in a mixed design experiment that involved two
interfaces (RAPTOR and Baseline) and two scenarios (attack and counter
insurgency). Dependent measures included situation awareness, decision making,
and workload. The results indicate that the RAPTOR interface produced
significantly better performance; they provide a strong validation of the
theoretical framework (Cognitive Systems Engineering and Ecological Interface
Design) and design principles (direct perception and direct manipulation), that
guided its development. Applications of this study include specific interface
design strategies for military command and control work domains.

%X The present study addresses the interaction between automation and
organization of human teams in controlling large robot teams performing an
Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task. We identify three subtasks: perceptual --
visual search for victims, assistance -- teleoperation to assist robot, and
navigation -- path planning and coordination. For the studies reported,
navigation was selected for automation because it involves weak dependencies
among robots making it more complex and because it was shown in an earlier
experiment to be the most difficult. Two possible ways to organize operators
were identified as assignment of robots to particular operators or as a shared
pool in which operators service robots from the population as needed. The
experiment compares two member teams of operators controlling teams of 12
robots each, in the assigned robots conditions or sharing control of 24 robots
in the shared pool conditions using either waypoint control or autonomous path
planning. Automating path planning improved system performance. Effects of team
organization were equivocal.

%X Macrocognition has been conceptualized by researchers in a number of ways
depending on the perspective of the different disciplines. For this research
the focus is on cognition in collaboration contexts, where problem solving
teams collaborate on short-term situations which require rapid action to be
taken against specific missions. We employed an empirical process for
evaluating a model of team collaboration by analyzing and coding transcripts or
chat logs that transpired during several real-world problem-solving events.
Traditional collaboration systems are domain independent, thus they do not
always support the difficult cognitive aspects of the task. The goal for the
research reported here is to understand the role of cognition in teams who are
collaborating to solve challenging, unique, information-rich problems and to
apply this understanding to make recommendations for collaboration support.

occurrence in our daily lives. The majority of the literature on interruptions
to date has been based on controlled laboratory experiments and it is not yet
completely clear how these results will translate into naturalistic settings
and/or if there are certain features of interruptions and resumption that are
not observable in the controlled setting. The current study is an exploratory
study of how interruptions manifest in the naturalistic environment. We found
that when working on computer-based tasks in real-world environments, external
interruptions are more disruptive than internal interruptions. However, no
reliable difference was shown in resumption time when resuming from multiple
interruptions as opposed to single interruptions, and when resuming a different
task as opposed to resuming the same task that was interrupted.

%X Research on task switching has focused on the relatively well known task
switching cost, an increase in RT on a trial directly following a switch. Two
main issues with previous studies raise concerns about their external validity
(1) they typically use short and arbitrary tasks in comparison to real work
situations and (2) the vast majority force participants to switch rather than
allowing them to do so voluntarily. The current experiment utilized two longer
lasting tasks (document proofreading and a Sudoku puzzle) to more closely
resemble real world situations and four task switching groups. One group
switched voluntarily, one was forced without warning, one was forced with a cue
that a switch would be coming, and one served as a no switch control group.
Performance, reaction time, and mental workload (NASA-TLX) were measured. Task
switch groups did not differ on these dependent variables, and no task
switching cost was observed. The failure to find a task switching cost lends
support to the proposition that previous lab studies may not adequately
resemble real world scenarios, and that micromanaging small tasks may not be
comparable to switching between comparatively longer lasting tasks.

essential to gain insight into what factors affect the disruptiveness of
interruptions. Although a significant body of research has approached this
problem from the systems and tasks sides, the role of specific cognitive traits
affecting interrupted task performance has been largely overlooked. In this
study, participants completed measures of intelligence, adaptability, and
impulsivity-reflexivity in an effort to determine whether these traits
influence interrupted task performance. Intelligence scores were found to
predict primary task latency, secondary task accuracy and the ability to resume
the primary task following an interruption.

%X A postcompletion error occurs when the final step of a task is omitted
because the main goal of the task is thought to be completed (Byrne &amp;
Bovair, 1997). Postcompletion errors are more likely to occur after
interruptions (Ratwani, McCurry &amp; Trafton, 2008). Global placekeeping cues
(Gray, 2000) allow a user to track their progress in a task and may be a method
for reducing the rate of postcompletion errors. A computer-based procedural
task with a postcompletion step was used in this experiment to determine how
the interaction of global placekeeping cues with interruptions would affect
postcompletion errors. These results suggest that global placekeeping cues
reduce the postcompletion error rate after interruptions, but that global
placekeeping does not completely eliminate postcompletion errors.

%X Supervision is a broad term that covers a wide range of task environments
and cognitive activities. Here, we describe one specific type called
multi-tasking supervision. It involves rapidly assessing a set of distinct
systems or situations and determining where attention is needed moment by
moment. Multi-tasking supervision is a key component of many command and
control, and other, tasks. This paper focuses on understanding the cognitive
needs of multi-tasking supervision and developing support concepts for it.
First, we place multi-tasking supervision within the context of other types of
supervision. Next, we consider the types of tasks and work environments that
are appropriate for multi-tasking supervision. Finally, we discuss computer
display concepts for supporting multi-tasking supervision.

%X The sequential revision of beliefs gives rise to a phenomenon referred to as
the order effect due to two heuristics, anchoring and adjustment and contrast
and inertia, as decision makers strive to incorporate confirming and
disconfirming evidence. We hypothesized that the sources of new information
would impact the order-effect. Results showed that confirming information from
intelligence officers (experts) had a stronger effect on belief adjustment than
information from a trusted friend, whereas disconfirming information from a
trustworthy friend had a stronger impact than information from intelligence
officers. A rationale for the differential effect of information source is
discussed.

%X Television shows like 'CSI' can give the impression that matching
crime-scene fingerprints is fully automated. But it is actually humans
(fingerprint experts) who ultimately decide whether a crime-scene print belongs
to a suspect or not. Despite this fact, there have been no published,
peer-reviewed studies directly examining the extent to which experts can
correctly match fingerprints to one another. In two experiments presented here
we aim to determine the factors affecting accuracy using non-expert
participants and test (1) whether the advantage found for the sequential
presentation of faces applies to prints and (2) whether the amount of
information in a print matters.

%X We investigate how people utilize motor preparation time under varying task
objectives as a cue to switch between tasks when dialing and driving. Previous
research has shown that people tend to switch between tasks at positions where
a chunk of digits is retrieved from memory. If the number of chunks is
minimized, do people use motor preparation time as a cue to switch between
tasks instead? A study was conducted in which participants drove a simulated
vehicle while also dialing two phone numbers that contained sets of repeating
digits. Participants tended to switch between tasks after typing in a complete
set of repeating digits. This effect took precedence over cognitive cues, and
was robust when different relative priorities for the two tasks were adhered to
(focus on driving, or on dialing). However, when participants prioritized
driving they invested more in steering control. Limitations and implications of
the work are discussed.

varying the amount of politeness or rudeness used and the power or familiarity
relationship between the participant and the directive giver. Results show
significant impacts of politeness on a variety of directive compliance
behaviors, and show accuracy for predicting the relationship of Social Distance
on perceived politeness and directive compliance. Predictions about the role of
Power relationships were generally not as effective.

%X Operating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires quickly replanning routes
to satisfy multiple complex three-dimensional (3D) mission constraints. How
well do conventional two-dimensional (2D) displays support replanning? What are
users' intuitions about alternate display formats, given the trend towards
user-configured displays? Previously, we developed a realistic replanning task,
and measured time and accuracy for satisfying UAV mission constraints. With
present-day 2D displays, performance was particularly poor in complex
mountainous environments (Cook, Smallman, Lacson, &amp; Manes, 2009). In the
current work, to address this shortfall, we designed novel displays to support
replanning, and measured performance and intuitions for three canonical display
formats: (1) baseline 2D, a proxy for current UAV displays, (2) augmented 2D,
with integrated replanning constraints, and (3) perspective 3D, comparable in
features to the augmented 2D. Using the three formats, participants replanned
UAV routes compromised by closed airspace and repositioned ISR targets, over
flat and mountainous terrain. Replanning was slowest and most error-prone for
baseline 2D in flat terrain, and error severity was greatest for perspective 3D
in mountainous terrain. However, users' intuitions strongly favored perspective
3D. Overall, time and accuracy were best for augmented 2D, and better
performance with augmented 2D relied less upon higher spatial ability. Results
highlight the mismatch of users' intuitions with performance, and the role of
individual differences. The study informs the design of future replanning
displays and lays the foundation for introducing and visualizing automated path
planning solutions.

%X This study investigated whether sub-auditory, infrasonic measures of vocal
cord microtremors are sensitive to workload manipulations in a collaborative
command and control task. Research participants performed 16 hours of simulated
military command and control scenarios during which time task demand and access
to collaborative tools were manipulated. NASA-TLX scores were used to assess
subjective workload while infrasonic measures of vocal cord undulations were
used as an objective measure of workload. The results of this study suggest
that during high task demand trials infrasonic measures increased. In addition,
during trials with access to collaborative tools that have previously been
found to decrease subjective workload, infrasonic measures also decreased.
Subjective workload scores and infrasonic measures were also found to correlate
during trials. These results provide promising empirical evidence for the
efficacy of this nonintrusive, non-invasive measure of operator workload.

%X Shift handovers occur in many safety-critical environments, including
aviation maintenance, medicine, air traffic control, and mission control for
space shuttle and space station operations. Shift handovers are associated with
increased risk of communication failures and human error. In dynamic
industries, errors and accidents occur disproportionately after shift handover.
Typical shift handovers involve transferring information from an outgoing shift
to an incoming shift via written logs, or in some cases, face-to-face
briefings. The current study explores the possibility of improving written
communication with the support modalities of audio and video recordings, as
well as face-to-face briefings. Fifty participants participated in an
experimental task which mimicked some of the critical challenges involved in
transferring information between shifts in industrial settings. All three
support modalities -- face-to-face, video, and audio recordings, reduced task
errors significantly over written communication alone. The support modality
most preferred by participants was face-to-face communication; the least
preferred was written communication alone.

%X People frequently use information and communication technologies such as
cell phones and email to mediate the transfer of private information. Often,
this information is intended to be shared only with the recipient or
recipients, and, in turn, kept from everyone else. However, people sometimes
make errors when disclosing private information. These errors can occur when
the intended information is sent to an unintended person or persons, when
unintended information is sent to the intended person, or a combination of
both. Fifteen adults (aged 19-23) were interviewed using the critical incident
method to elicit past instances of erroneous disclosure. The interviewer sought
to understand the circumstances surrounding incidents of erroneous relays of
private information. Participants reported an average of 3.67 (SD = 1.59)
instances of erroneous disclosure, or misclosure per person. Most reported
errors involved email and other familiar technologies, with various
designed-based causes. These findings point towards specific design features
common to many information and communication technologies such as predictive
text and button proximity that may lead to erroneous disclosure.

%X The increasing use of healthcare information technology has a direct,

Many studies have evaluated how patient-provider interactions are affected by
the implementation of an already developed technology. Instead, we propose that
research in understanding and modeling communication should inform healthcare
IT design so that systems can support the communication that needs to exist.
This paper briefly describes two communication models (one based in healthcare
and one based in business organizational communication), their similarities and
differences, and research outcomes related to their use when evaluating
communication in the healthcare domain. We then describe how these models might
be combined and used as an underlying model to inform and validate design for
healthcare IT.

mood and performed tasks as dyads or triads either face-to-face or
distributedly. Although the affective state manipulation did not affect
performance, the more positive affect the groups reported, the more words the
groups used to communicate. Distributed groups did not generate more ideas or
act less cooperatively than face-to-face groups. However, face-to-face triads
performed better on the information exchange task than distributed triads;
distributed dyads outperformed face-to-face dyads. An interaction between
affective state and group type was also found for trust in the computerized

%X Given the increasing importance of globalization and collaboration, this
research investigates the possibility of training globally dispersed teams
using the virtual world Second Life. Three meeting conditions, the 3D virtual
world Second Life, a combination of face-to-face and Second Life and
face-to-face were evaluated. Thirty randomly assigned 3 person teams performed
an ice-breaker session and then a team-building activity in each meeting
condition. Four dependent variables were measured: task completion time;
quality of task performance; subjective satisfaction with the process based on
group cohesiveness, perception of the process and satisfaction with the
outcome; and subjective satisfaction with the communication modality. Following
data collection, univariate analyses were used to analyze each dependent
variable to determine the differences, if any, among the meeting conditions.
The results did not show significant differences for performance and subjective
satisfaction with the process across the meeting conditions; however they did
show significant results for subjective satisfaction with the communication
modality. The Second Life and face-to-face conditions were rated more highly
than the combination condition. This study indicates that the participants
found the virtual world productive, enjoyed the experience of using this
environment and believed that they could communicate and collaborate in it
effectively. Even though participants indicated little previous experience with
Second Life, this study found that it has potential as an alternate team
meeting space. Cost analyses suggest that in the long run the expense of using
a virtual meeting space will be lower than the cost of using face-to-face
meetings for globally dispersed teams. Future research could include looking at
larger group sizes, other types of team work, different team-building
activities, or the effect of features of the virtual meeting space on team
performance and user experience.

the concept and address design challenges. User validation and testing of the
concept were integrated into the process and occurred iteratively throughout
development. Post deployment user feedback and lessons learned are also

%X Computer workstations are increasingly being fitted with multiple large
displays. Display placement influences head posture and neck symptoms but the
effects of multiple displays are not well known. This study evaluated the
placement of two wide displays over a large range of heights and distances.
Twenty participants performed internet search tasks with the search window at
thirty-six positions, defined by three distances from the eyes (50 to 86 cm),
three gaze angles (0 to 28&deg; below the eye horizon), and four lateral
distances from the mid-sagittal plane (13 and 32 cm to the left and to the
right). Motion capture equipment tracked head and neck postures and simulation
software calculated muscular capacities. Regression analyses demonstrated
significant (p &lt; 0.001) effects of gaze angle on neck flexion, lateral angle
on neck rotation, and the interaction of gaze angle and lateral angle on neck
lateral flexion. The moment generating capacities of the trapezius and splenius
muscles, and the self-selected display positions, suggest that increases in
wide display's field-of-view should be biased vertically (upward).

%X A preliminary report from a crew station working group (CSWG) suggested that
the 0&deg; orientation (from an aerial view) of a new trackball for the MH-60
may introduce undue fatigue for operators. Feedback from the CSWG suggested
that this fatigue may be reduced by rotating the trackball inboard in order to
keep the wrist straight. To investigate this, in Experiment 1 participants used
the trackball for an extended period of time (90 minutes) from various angles
(0&deg;, 12&deg;, and 90&deg;). The results from Experiment 1 suggested that
12&deg; was the preferred angle, but qualitative comments suggested that more
cant was needed. To address this, in Experiment 2 the angle of the trackball
was adjustable from 15&deg; to 35&deg;. Linear regression models estimated the
optimal angle to be approximately 25&deg;, confirming the earlier qualitative
comments from Experiment 1. Given the broad range in preferred angles, a
rotatable trackball was recommended. Furthermore, the qualitative comments from
Experiment 1 and 2 were organized into various categories in order to provide
additional recommendations for the design of the trackball.

%X As touch screen technology improves in functionality and decreases in price,
these input devices are becoming increasingly more integrated into daily life.
People are frequently required to interact with touch screens at places ranging
from their local grocery stores to airport check-in kiosks. Since it is
becoming necessary for people to use touch screens in order to access needed
products or services, we conducted an experiment to examine how individuals
with varying motor control disabilities perform on a simple number entry task.
Since some individuals may also be wheelchair users, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines allows for the touch screen to be
approachable by a wheelchair user from the front or parallel (side), the effect
of approach on performance was also evaluated. Participants with and without
motor control disabilities, including wheelchair users, performed a number
entry task on a number pad with different combinations of button and gap sizes,
while seated at a touch screen kiosk. Results revealed that participants with
motor control impairments had significantly more inaccurate touches overall
than participants without. Performance from the front orientation was
significantly more accurate than from the side for all participants, regardless
of the presence of a motor control disability. Results from this study may be
used to guide design of touch screen accessibility for individuals with motor
control disabilities and wheelchair users.

%X A zoomable user interface (ZUI) is a useful function to help users deal with
large information spaces displayed within a screen. However, ZUI usability has
not been sufficiently studied. Its problems may be more crucial for older users
than younger ones. This study examined the effects of three zoom foci
(original-center, re-center and dynamic) and two zoom scales (100% and 400%)
for the younger and older adults on mouse-based information searching tasks in
a map-type space. Twenty four subjects participated in the experiments by
answering a pair of questions. Task completion time, number of operations and
number of errors were measured, and a satisfaction rate was collected. Older
adults used the ZUIs less efficiently than younger ones. The effects of zoom
focus methods varied with the zoom scales regardless of the age groups. The
participants preferred using the dynamic focus regardless of zoom scale and
using the re-center focus with the 400% scale. We discuss potential
implications of the age-related performance differences and the effects of ZUI
functions, and suggest some ZUI design guidelines in conclusion.

a small sample of usability test participants, the scaling procedure remained
unbiased and could accurately differentiate usable from unusable user
interfaces.

%X Reciprocal tapping tasks have frequently been used to quantify user
performance and motor control system function. This experiment used a
reciprocal tapping task to examine differences in performance for participants
oriented both in front and to the side of a touch screen. Evaluating
performance in different orientations for touch screen users is important
because public spaces and workplaces may have barriers which preclude touch
screens from always being operated from directly in front. Additionally,
building design standards may require a wheelchair user in a public building to
operate a touch screen from the side because there may not be enough clearance
to orient their wheelchair in a manner which allows them to only operate the
screen from the front. Participants with motor control impairments affecting
the upper extremity and participants without upper extremity motor control
impairments completed a study examining reciprocal tapping performance while
using a touch screen. Both groups included wheelchair users. Results indicate
the orientation of the user, with respect to the touch screen, influences the
number of taps which can be completed in five seconds and the amount of force
used to activate the buttons. Both variables are negatively affected when the
touch screen is oriented to the side of the user. Additionally, users with
motor control impairments affecting the upper extremity completed fewer taps
and had longer dwell times on the buttons than participants with nonimpaired
upper extremities. This experiment helps us begin to understand the impact of
user interface position but more research, including more ecologically valid
tasks for the user, is needed.

%X Automated analysis methods are needed to convert eye tracking data into
meaningful descriptions of high-level scanning strategies that can help
usability professionals understand how designs are viewed. Prior techniques for
analyzing eye tracking sequences, or scanpaths, are limited in their ability to
find aggregated visual search strategies for a group of observers. We describe
a pattern analysis tool that finds clusters of sequentially matching patterns
among multiple scanpaths. Scanning strategies are clustered hierarchically,
then represented as aggregate scanpaths. The tool can also match scanpaths
against a hypothetical scanning strategy, input by mouse gesture. Use of the
pattern analysis tool was demonstrated using a 114-participant eye tracking
dataset in which several aggregate scanning strategies were identified.
Matching against a hypothetical, counter-clockwise scanning strategy was also
included in the demonstration. The analysis tool provides a valuable resource
for aggregating or grouping scanning strategies, a vital step toward
generalizing eye tracking results to guide design recommendations for improving
usability.

%X When is the usability of a new user interface design good enough to stop
trying to improve it? To answer this question, we propose that usability
ratings should be scaled in terms of specific usability criteria, and we
evaluated this proposal in an iterative user interface design effort. We also
tested our hypothesis that usability ratings arise from the interaction of
three user interface dimensions: content, functionality, and layout. We found
that scaling usability ratings in terms of specific requirements was effective
in identifying when to stop iterating a design, and that ratings of the UI
dimensions predicted the usability ratings.

%X In many corporate settings, users are required to quickly execute commands.
Three methods of issuing commands were compared: 1) selecting a menu item with
a mouse (Menu-Mouse condition); 2) selecting a menu item with a keyboard
shortcut (Menu-Keyboard condition); and 3) selecting a toolbar item with a
mouse (Toolbar-Mouse condition). Users performed one of the three methods
across 90 trials and had their speed assessed in blocks of 30 trials. Overall,
the Toolbar-Mouse method was the fastest, while the Menu-Keyboard condition
showed the most improvement. A GOMS-based model is presented that accounts for
differences among methods. This work confirms the use of toolbars for common
commands, but also suggests that for heavily-used interfaces, keyboard
shortcuts can be as efficient as toolbars and have the advantage of providing
fast access to all commands.

%X Target size recommendations found in the literature for touchscreen mobile
devices take into account finger inaccuracies in order to provide good
selection accuracy. These recommendations are violated when a virtual QWERTY
keyboard is designed into a mobile interface. Small targets increase the
severity of finger occlusion, resulting in higher selection errors. It has been
observed that an offset exists between the intended landing location and actual
finger contact location. An experiment was conducted to study the contact
offset and how it is affected by different target size, gender, finger used,
and prior experience using handheld touchscreen device. Results show that
irrespective of target size, users tend to aim towards the center of the
target, and that an offset exists between the target center and actual contact.
Mean value of the offset lies beneath and to the right of the target center for
right handed users. Providing this offset globally by shifting the reported
finger contact location or locally by shifting the target active area could
greatly improve small target selection.

layouts of game controllers and direct manipulation touchscreen devices has
afforded an opportunity to evaluate how these new input methods can increase
efficiency of computer systems that involve the display of complex,
densely-packed information. Here, alternative button layouts (through various
game controllers) and touchscreen devices were used to navigate through a
simulated workflow in a submarine contact management task. Task completion time
and errors were recorded, and results show that only some of the alternative
input devices sped up the time it takes to cycle through a commonly used
workflow. Implications for integration of these devices with already-existing
systems are discussed along with future research directions.

%X Identifying human factors issues before systems are built and demonstrating
the importance of those issues to decision makers outside the human factors
community is difficult. Modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) has become a critical
part of tackling this challenge, but the true impact of M&amp;S is made when
the results can be translated into predictions that are important to the
decision makers such as future system performance. Through the use of the
Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT), analysts are able to
quantify the effect of human operator performance on system performance.
IMPRINT is a task network modeling tool designed to help assess the influence
of the human operator on system performance throughout the system lifecycle.
This demonstration will provide a brief overview of IMPRINT and its
capabilities and highlight new features that provide enhanced modeling
capabilities and better results visualization. It will also feature a look at

Coding and Visual Representation of Data) to facilitate real-time
classification of live or video-recorded individual and team behavior. The tool
is easy to use as its design exploits the possibilities that the touch-based
interface of the tablet PC provides. ECOVRD is highly versatile: coding
categories are user-defined and can capture instances of behavior or the
duration of behavior. In addition, a note-pad feature enables users to enter
observations as text. ECOVRD also includes a visualization module that provides
users with graphic data summaries and basic statistics for immediate feedback.
Thus, it will be useful both to the research community and in applied settings,
for instance to support professional coaching or training. This paper discusses
the salient design and interaction aspects of ECOVRD, and its improvements over
existing systems.

%X We previously developed a core representation for computationally comparing
the information an operator needs to perform a task and the information
provided by a user interface. This representation is based on information
theoretic properties, thus it can be applied to a wide variety of work domains
and information and display types. In prior work, we used this capability to
dynamically and automatically reconfigure cockpit displays for military
cockpits. More recently, we adapted this approach to the task of evaluating and
critiquing display format designs for NASA's space operations. The
representation and reasoning approach generalizes well to describing
information types in procedural domains and the tool can analyze sets of
display formats for sets of procedures, propose format improvements against a
procedure set, project how changes to procedures will affect the suitability of
existing formats, and project how changes to formats will improve or reduce
their suitability for given procedures. Most recently, we have proposed
extensions to evaluate and support "configuration consistency" of interfaces,
within a system over time, across systems and even across vehicles and their
associated work domains.

which is challenging because runners' eyes should be adjusted to vigorous,
mainly vertical, movements. To unload the burden on the eyes, we developed a
technology, called "ReadingMate," which basically adjusts the positions of
content (e.g., text) on a computer display along with the head movements of a
runner. To test the effectiveness of ReadingMate and the influence of visual
cues from surrounding environments, we conducted a two-factor within-subject
study with 20 participants. ReadingMate showed statistically significant
effects on decreasing various adverse experiences, such as shaking, dizziness,
distraction, and fatigue. However, we failed to find evidence showing that
visual cues disrupt the effects of ReadingMate. The study partially proved that
ReadingMate could help runners read while running on a treadmill.

%X Learning-by-doing is a well-established pedagogical tool. This approach was
incorporated into a semester-long course on skill acquisition. The primary goal
for the course was to explore general issues in skill acquisition, transfer,
and retention from both a methodological and a substantive perspective.
Students read articles from the research literature on motor, perceptual, and
cognitive skills; expertise, automaticity, and training. The research articles
were selected to provide a foundation for theories of learning, models of skill
acquisition, and controversies about optimal training methods. Each student
also selected a skill to acquire during the semester and committed to practice
3-8 hours per week. This learning-by-doing aspect of the course included
maintaining a journal, creating measures of their skill, participating in
weekly discussions about their skill acquisition efforts, writing an
integrative review paper about the domain of their skill, and demonstrating

provided a valuable overview of skill acquisition in general and that their

%X Laboratory-based learning plays an important role in the introductory
Ergonomics course at the University of Oklahoma. Qualitative analyses of
technical reports over several semesters revealed repeated problems. Students
were unfamiliar with academic publications, did not know how to report results,
and had difficulty interpreting results. In addition to these problems, other
difficulties arose. Students felt overwhelmed. Some developed a dislike for the
field of human factors. Several cited the labs as the source of their
dissatisfaction. To address these problems, we adopted a new approach to
conducting the laboratory portion of the course. We sought to increase student
engagement, support learning through scaffolding, increase the rate and
quantity of feedback, and provide team-development opportunities. Students'
performance in data analysis and technical writing improved over the previous
year and throughout the semester. Satisfaction with the course as a whole and
the laboratory section in particular improved. We are pleased with the results
and plan to continue refining the course design. We hope that this article will
inspire discussion of effective techniques in ergonomics laboratory
instruction.

%X Although considered one of the best in the world, in many ways America's
educational system is not living up to its expectations. Taking an
interdisciplinary approach to learning and training through integrating human
factors (HF) is not a novel idea, yet it seems that further work can still be
done to increase outcomes. This paper intends to investigate the similarities
and differences of the theory of cognitive load (CLT), which is used
extensively in instructional design, with various fundamental human factors
constructs (workload, flow state, and transfer appropriate processing.). This
may help to increase understanding between the fields, as well as find
important similarities and differences between the given theories to increase
the benefits of instructional design.

%X When today's students graduate from college and start their first job, many
have close to twenty years of computer use exposure and some of them also have
discomfort associated with this exposure. This discomfort may be due, in part,
to a lack of training, from schools or other sources, in healthy computing
habits (such as taking breaks, reducing awkward postures and postural fixity,
etc.). A long-term goal of this line of research is to improve the health of
students. In this study students were introduced to the concept and principles
of healthy computing. The specific aim of this study was to recruit a small
group of students to learn, in a participatory fashion, about healthy computing
and then to assist them to develop means for effectively conveying their
knowledge to other students. The objective of this paper is to explain the
methodology that was utilized in the study and to provide evidence of its

to be common sense, but they often come from disparate fields to study HCI. In
an effort to assist faculty in developing successful HCI curricula, five (5)
sample pairings of design concepts and popular media are presented. Key HCI
design principles and concepts are demonstrated using relevant, current media
examples that the students may have had previous exposure to. Initial use of
these tools has proven to be promising in terms of engaging students and

%X This session will provide attendees with several new ideas and examples for
using older and newer types of technology and devices in order to appeal to the
visual learner in every student. As described by Felder &amp; Brent (2005), "A
goal of instruction should be to equip students with the skills associated with
every learning style category, regardless of the students' personal
preferences, since they will need all of those skills to function effectively
as professionals." Although we are educators and many of our doctoral students
aspire to go into academia, our primary focus in the course of our training was
most likely not education, per se, but engineering, psychology, human factors,
or some other discipline. It is often the case that subject matter experts do
not also formally acquire expertise in teaching methods. According to Wankat
&amp; Oreovicz (1993)(pg 1), "The majority of engineering professors have never
had a formal course in education." Some people do have natural gifts for
teaching, but Wankat &amp; Oreovicz (1993)(pg 1) believe that "It is possible
to learn how to teach well." This belief, as well as the belief that educators
want to teach well, are primary motivators for organizing this session, which
has been designed to provide current and aspiring instructors with some
additional knowledge and methods for enhancing their pedagogic skills.

of teaching students the key foundational knowledge, most consider HF/E degree
programs a success. Along with this foundational knowledge, however, HF/E
professionals need a variety of skills including skills in problem solving,
skills in applying research to practice, and skills enabling them to work
effectively on interdisciplinary teams. The purpose of this panel is to
generate discussion regarding the current challenges that HF/E practitioners
face in tackling the needs of industry and government and how HF/E related
degree programs are addressing these issues. To accomplish this, five panelists
will provide a variety of perspectives. One panelist provides the perspective
of U.S. Department of Defense military system acquisition. Another panelist
provides the perspective of working as a system safety engineer at an aircraft
manufacturer. The three remaining panelists provide the perspective of
educators and researchers. The universities that these three panelists

%X Wheeled mobility device users face challenges in terms of access to the
built environment and maneuverability within the built environment has received
limited attention. As the wheeled mobility device user population has changed
drastically in the recent years, there is a need to update accessibility
standards and develop reliable methods for testing user performance in the
built environment. This paper presents a comparison of restricted and
unrestricted space requirements for angle turns (L-turns) with the aim of
highlighting differences between space requirements in these situations and
comparing the results to current accessibility standards. One hundred forty
wheeled mobility device users completed L-turns to the best of their ability in
a restricted space environment, and thirteen performed the same maneuver in an
unrestricted space environment. Data indicates that although entrance
dimensions of the turns are similar between the restricted space and
unrestricted space groups, there is a significant difference between exit
dimensions. This suggests that when unrestricted space is utilized, users may
adopt different strategies and paths when executing their turns. Additionally,
a comparison of the study results, both in the restricted and unrestricted
conditions, to current accessibility standards indicates that a large
proportion of individuals may not be able to successfully complete L-turns in
compliant built environments. In the design of the built environment,
researchers and designers should consider space requirements, ease of execution
and time of execution simultaneously to create comfortable and accessible
environments for normal and urgent circumstances.

%X A ramp is the basic type of an assisting device for wheelchair users.
Although the height of a ramp is an important design element, it has not been
considered in prior studies. Therefore, in this study, the ramp slope and
height are considered as independent variables. To analyze the effects of the
slope and height, five levels of slope (1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:12 and 1:14) and
three levels of height (15 cm, 30 cm and 45 cm) are considered. For the
dependent variables, the total time and velocity were considered as performance
measures, pulse rate changes and EMG signals of four related muscles (extensor
carpi radialis, triceps brachii, anterior deltoid and posterior deltoid) were
considered as physiology measures, and perceived discomfort while ascending and
descending were considered as perceived discomfort measures. As a result,
differences among performance, physiological characteristic and perceived
discomfort for the five slopes increased as the height increased. Additionally,
slope effects were minor when the height was low (15 cm). In summary, there was
no significant difference between 1:10 and 1:12 (as suggested by ADAAG). In
addition, slope effects were minor at a low height; thus, a slope of 1:8 can be
recommended if the installation space for a gentler ramp is not sufficient.

%X Rani Lueder, will discuss the implications the findings from her industrial
design class projects at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena involving
elderly simulations to evaluate products and environments. Class projects
emphasized simulations of the functional limitations of elders aged 80+ years
to evaluate the design implication of anthropometric, cognitive / psychosocial,
physical / motor coordination, visual, hearing and kinesthetic dimensions.
   In an informal poll of a small group of HF professionals, opinions were
divided about whether or not "baby boomers" would find themselves left behind
by technology when they reached the age of 65, like many of today's older
adults seem to be. Technologies that used to be simple (phones, cars) have
gotten increasingly complex, and one could argue that usability, overall, has
decreased for everyone. But are there things we can do that can help ensure
that older adults never find themselves on the "wrong" side of the digital
divide? I think there are some universal rules that can be applied that would
help, but the question is whether the profession will actually apply them.
   Dr. Rogers will discuss the sequence of including older adults in the
testing of future home technologies: starting with focus groups and interviews,
testing of initial prototypes in the Human Factors &amp; Aging Laboratory,
wizard-of-oz testing in the Aware Home Residential Laboratory, and then field
testing in older adults' homes.
   Dr. Charness will discuss the CREATE system, which includes an emphasis on
design guidelines that incorporates consideration of a range of elder design
considerations that include perceptual changes, cognitive changes, psychomotor
changes, attitudes and the physical and social environment and their effect on
how well a technology or a tech training program works for older adults.
   His presentation will include a discussion of practical considerations,
including how to design a time-out interval for inputting text messages on a
cell phone (a rare case where what works for older adults doesn't work for
younger ones). He will also discuss examples from his research for the NRC on
human factors in home healthcare.

%X User-selected display placement for young computer users (prepresbyopes) and
older computer users with presbyopia, wearing multifocal lens correction, has
been observed in field settings, but not while both groups used the same
display size or illumination technology. A field study was conducted to examine
placement of an 18.5-inch, widescreen LCD display for prepresbyopes and
presbyopes using multifocal lens correction. Both groups viewed the 18.5"
display for four days as they performed their usual computer tasks at their
workstations. Multifocal wearers selected a display height that was lower than
computer users who did not have presbyopia. As a result the eye-to-screen angle
for presbyopes was significantly lower than prepresbyopes. The findings
potentially affect proper design and selection of adjustable display supports.
Measures of gross body posture and text size were also collected. Multifocal
wearers did not choose seated postures different from prepresbyopes.
Additionally, the majority of both groups viewed text at arc angles smaller
than ANSI/HFES 100-2007 and ISO 9241-3 recommendations.

known about the effect of computer-related discomfort on the performance of
daily activities. This paper describes the severity of discomfort and problems
with daily activities and demonstrates the associations between discomfort and
daily activities. 75 computer-users rated the severity of their
computer-related discomfort and the severity of daily activity problems.
Analysis suggested that while the majority of computer users experienced mild
discomfort and no problems with daily activities, a minority experienced
moderate to severe discomfort and problems. Multiple regression analyses
indicated that severity of discomfort was associated with severity of problems
and that the back and right arm/hand had the greatest frequency of associations
with problems of daily activities. These results underline the toll that
computer-related discomfort can have on all activities in a workers life.

%X As the locus of health care migrates from institutional to home- and
community-based settings, designers face news challenges in developing consumer
health information technology (health IT) to support patients and informal
caregivers with their new self-care and self-management responsibilities. For
such technologies to be appropriately designed, they must be aligned, in part,
with the cultural context within which these consumers are embedded. Designing
culturally-informed consumer health IT is challenging partly because of the
tensions that exist between engineering and cultural anthropological approaches
to studying the intersection of culture and technology. This paper proposes
both a framework for conceptualizing these tensions and a potential embedded,
sequential integration of these approaches to capitalize on the strengths and
mitigate the weaknesses of each methodological perspective.

%X U.S. healthcare reform demands that ergonomically trained health
professionals reassess how they deliver their services. One innovative strategy
to deliver ergonomic assessment and modification is tele-ergonomics. This
practice-oriented paper will describe the process of developing the
Tele-rehabilitation Computer Ergonomics System (tele-CES). The tele-CES will be
a valid and reliable systematic program using existing previously validated
ergonomic instruments. This program will allow ergonomically trained health
professionals to: 1) remotely assess the computer workstation, which will
eliminate several barriers to access experienced by computer operators; and 2)
based on the assessment, generate explicit participant-specific workstation
modification recommendations. These recommendations will be easily implemented;
reduce pain, discomfort, and fatigue; and eliminate barriers to productivity.
The tele-CES will be developed as a collaboration between ergonomically trained
health professionals in multiple locations in the US, tele-rehabilitation
experts, and consumers. This system will reduce the personal cost of obtaining
expert ergonomic assessments and interventions and provide an evidence-based
and systematic program of completing ergonomic assessments remotely.

%X Sledding, like other recreational sports, is associated with inherent risks
of injury in which behavioral factors may influence the accident and injury
modes. In the present work, we examined the rate of personal protective
equipment (PPE) usage and its relationship to various environmental and user
characteristics at three popular sledding sites in California. Experimenters
measured speeds and collected observations of equipment type, helmet use,
sledder age and gender, along with on-product warnings and safety information
for some of the products observed during data collection. The recorded sledder
speeds were within the range of impact speeds for which helmets have been shown
to reduce the likelihood of head injury. Despite this, and despite the
prevalence of on-product warnings recommending helmet use, the observed usage
rate of protective equipment while sledding was less than 5 percent for all
sledders. Given the importance of helmets in reducing the risk of head injury
in snowsports, these findings have important implications for the snowsport and
broader safety community.

%X It is well-established that acoustic, psychoacoustic, and cognitive
parameters can affect sound perception and response. Over the last several
decades, there has been an increase in the amount of research on auditory
stimuli and their effect on human perception and response. Objective techniques
to evaluate acoustic signals have become an essential part of several
industries and their application in accident reconstruction can also prove
beneficial. Specifically, objective techniques that employ the appropriate
technology to record and play back accurate representations of an auditory
scene would allow for researchers and triers of fact to experience the auditory
stimuli that could otherwise only be quantified or described through technical
measurements. These efforts will significantly improve evidentiary value,
analyses, and conclusions. The purpose of this paper is to present a case for
the use of this technology within the accident reconstruction field in order to
accurately represent a receiver's perception of a sound. This proposition is
partially based on the authors' experience in using this technology to capture
sound scene information in previous litigation work.

%X One of the many challenges facing people with disabilities today is finding
accessible housing, since the abilities and disabilities of this group vary
widely. The Fair Housing Act was enacted to prevent housing discrimination and
covers private multi-family housing and requires that all ground floor
apartments (including condominiums) and all floors of elevator buildings of
four or more units, built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, comply with
the Act. There is disagreement among experts about how best to accommodate
people with disabilities. This panel will bring together experts to discuss the
current state of legal, design and usability issues for people with
disabilities.

%X The inclusion of automation has been critical for increased safety and
efficiency in complex systems such as aviation and process control, but one
unintended consequence for human operators is boredom. In many phases of
operation (i.e., en-route flight over the Atlantic and full-power nuclear power
plant operations), operators are monitoring interfaces, waiting for the
unlikely system anomaly. Such highly automated environments require levels of
vigilance that are difficult for operators to maintain, and resulting boredom
increases the likelihood of operator distraction, which ultimately can affect
system performance if operators miss or respond late to critical events. This
presentation will highlight the problems of sustained attention and boredom in
highly automated environments. Panelists will discuss areas of future research
as well as review other efforts of the Committee on Human-Systems Integration.

%X Remote usability testing is emerging as a popular approach through which
evaluators can test technology interfaces on a large number of participants
quickly and inexpensively. Two types of remote studies have been employed,
either with a moderator interacting remotely with the participant or in an
unmoderated format. But without a moderator, or even when the moderator is
present but not collocated with the participant, there is some question as to
whether the results can match the validity, reliability, and acceptability of a
live testing paradigm. This session is a novel format that pits the two in a
head-to-head challenge during the conference session. The audience is asked to
be a part of the session as test participants and/or results evaluators. The
session is divided into three modules. In the first module, a remote
unmoderated study was conducted on the HFES.org web using the current state of
the art for remote, unmoderated testing. The other two modules are conducted
live during the conference session. In the second module, a moderated remote
study is conducted with the moderator located in other room but with the
participants in the conference session room. In the third module, a live study
is conducted with a moderator collocated with the participants in the
conference session room. These two modules also use state-of-the-art techniques
for these methods. The final time block of the session is used to interactively
discuss the differences in the results with the audience. They are able to
decide for themselves the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

the impact of sleep loss and other stressors on dismounted warfighter
performance, and the effects of chronic inadequate sleep on cognitive
readiness. It is important to understand both the differences in the effects of
sleep in these environments, as well as the commonalities that can be applied
to multiple environments and operators. Our panelists include some of the
foremost sleep experts of today, as well as others who examine sleep in their
human performance research. Participation in this panel will include discussing
their latest research, offering practical applications, and engaging the

%X During laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon's hand-eye coordination is often
disrupted by the incongruent mapping between the orientation of the endoscopic
view and the actual operative field. This can lead to higher mental load and
deteriorated performance for the surgeon. This study investigated the effect of
visual-motor misalignment on laparoscopic surgery performance. Twenty-four
subjects participated in a dynamic point-and-touch task, with 8 image rotations
under different optical axes and different endoscope locations in a simulated
laparoscopic surgery environment. Performance was best when the endoscopic
image was perfectly aligned with the actual task space (0&deg; image rotation),
but degraded progressively as a function of deviation from perfect alignment.
Subjects' performance maintained a consistent pattern across 8 image rotations
regardless of optical axis orientation and endoscope location. Therefore, it is
recommended that any solution to restore the visuomotor congruency in
laparoscopic surgery should first align the image with the task space.

%X Failure to properly consider tendon and applied forces in designing a hand
tool can have harmful effects on users. Previous study has indicated that
flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS)
tendon forces can be up to 3.7 times the external forces. These values are
indirect estimates derived from biomechanical models developed for the hand.
However, these include many assumptions and may not be accurate. Therefore,
direct measurement of tendon forces using a cadaver model provided novel
insights into measuring internal impact of flexor tendons generated by power
grip motion and then determining optimal handle size reducing internal tendon
loads. In the result, there was a negative relationship between handle diameter
and grip force, which showed that the grip force decreased from 38.3 to 23.0 N,
as the cylindrical handle diameter increased from 30 to 60 mm. Thus, the
highest grip force was generated on the smallest handle size (30mm), and the
lowest grip force was on the largest diameter handle (60mm). In terms of the
ratio of the internal tendon force to the external grip force, the internal
tendon load on the smallest handle size (30mm) was, for external grip force F,
4.2F and the largest handle showed 7.0F (i.e. seven times the applied external
force). These relationships should be useful for the design of handles that
require power grip motion. Consequently, this study provided novel insights
into the direct measurement of internal impact of flexor tendons generated by
power grip motion with handles.

%X Prolonged standing is a common requirement in the workplace and is a
well-known cause of discomfort. This experiment investigated the effect of
material properties of flooring surfaces on perceived discomfort during
prolonged standing. Behavioral responses to prolonged standing such as
fidgeting (or weight-shifting between feet) were also analyzed. Participants
stood for four hours on each of four "anti-fatigue" mats and a hard surface
(control condition) while discomfort ratings and in-shoe pressures on the feet
were recorded. Results showed that discomfort ratings did not significantly
differ among mats, but all mats were more comfortable than the hard floor
during the fourth hour of standing. The frequency of fidgeting was affected by
flooring surface and was correlated to discomfort. The results indicate that if
differences in discomfort between these mats exist, they require a longer
standing duration to be observed. The behavioral results provide a possible
proxy measurement for discomfort, as well as information that can be used to
direct future physiological and biomechanical research.

%X Every year a significant number of young children are injured as a result of
accidents that occur on board trains in Great Britain. These accidents range
from being caught in internal doors, slips, trips and falls and injuries caused
by seats. We describe our efforts working with RSSB to design a new set of
safety signs in order to help prevent such accidents occurring. The research
involved running a set of workshops with young school children (aged 4-10,
n=210) and showing them examples of existing train signs and gathering the
requirements for new designs. A second set of workshops with these children was
used to evaluate the new signs based on the outcomes from the earlier workshop.
We describe our findings alongside a set of outline guidelines for the design
of safety signs for young children, A final section outlines possibilities for
future research.

%X Previous psychological research into human induced causes of environmental
change has stemmed largely from a behavior modification approach and has shown
only modest results. We suggest that the lack of long term success in this area
may be due to the lack of attention toward the underlying design dimensions to
these problems. In this paper, we attempt to illustrate that by using our
understanding of design principles related to human behavior and performance,
the human factors community has the unique potential to make significant
strides in improving these underlying design dimensions. Along these lines,
applicable research areas include cognitive decision making, product design,
surface transportation, and environmental design. We argue that, by shaping
technologies in a way that is both user friendly and environmentally benign,
the science of human factors has the potential to grow in new areas of research
-- areas that are not only theoretically relevant but also of societal
importance.

%X Stress is an important aspect of operational settings. This article presents
the results of a study providing further validation of a short multidimensional
self-report measure of stress-state, the Short Stress State Questionnaire
(SSSQ; Helton, 2004). We investigated stress during high event rate target
detection tasks. In previous target detection studies using the established
Dundee Stress State Questionnaire two phenomena have been consistently
reported: (1) an increase in Distress over the task and (2) the highest
post-task state correlate with target detection performance is Engagement. In
the present experiment in which 40 participants performed high event rate
target detection tasks, both phenomena were replicated with the SSSQ. The
24-item SSSQ appears to be a useful measure of stress-state applicable in a
wide variety of settings of interest to Human Factors practitioners.

%X Processes involved in discrimination of targets from non-targets differing
by a single critical feature were explored. Participants learned 80 target
nouns (singular and plural), and were tested on 120 nouns: 40 targets, 40
similar non-targets (plurality changed between study and test), and 40 novel
non-targets. Speeded (250ms, 1000ms) yes-no judgments were required after each
test item. In Experiment 1, participants were informed before study, or after
study but before recognition, that the test contained non-targets similar to
targets by virtue of a plurality change. Controls received no such
instructions. Target/non-target similarity instructions reduced false alarms to
similar non-targets and enhanced discrimination only when participants were
informed before study, and at the 1000ms response interval. In Experiment 2,
one group of participants was oriented to the specific discriminating feature
before study, while another group was instructed that the task was difficult
and to invest considerable effort at study. Specifically orientating
participants to the critical feature change again improved discrimination and
reduced false alarm rates, while merely emphasizing the requirement for
effortful encoding did not. Detailed monitoring and control of
target/non-target discrimination are effective in reducing false recognition
only if the necessary discriminating features are deliberately encoded at
study, and if sufficient time is given for deliberate retrieval at test.

%X Preventable patient harm due to errors in medication ordering, transcribing,

Institute of Medicine's 2007 report "Preventing Medication Errors".
Additionally, the report states that there are "enormous gaps in the knowledge
base with regard to medication errors" and that the current methods available
to solve this problem are inadequate (IOM, 2007, p2). Consequently, human
factors research can contribute to the solution for this national problem by
addressing the complexity in current medication systems and by designing
user-centered solutions that support the real complex cognitive work of the
clinicians. Panelists in this session, who have been funded by the federal
government, private industry, and fellowships, will briefly share their human
factors research on medication systems and then discuss how human factors
researchers and practitioners can contribute to medication safety goals.

%X The usability of electronic health records (EHRs) has received increased
attention as it has been identified as one of the key barriers to adoption of
EHRs. Every day, health care workers face many usability issues with EHRs such
as workflows that do not match clinical processes, alert fatigue (both visual
and audio), information overload and frustration with what is perceived as
excessive clicks during routine tasks. All this contributes to frustration,
and, ultimately, impacts patient care. But what does it mean to have a 'usable'
application? Why are EHRs hard to use? This panel brings together practicing
physicians trained in medical informatics to provide their unique and
front-line perspective on what the real issues are with EHRs and how human
factors affects usage. We will address three questions: (1) Why is usability a
hard problem in EHRs? (2) From a user's view, what is the cost of poor
usability? And (3) what can be done to increase adoption and usage of EHRs in
the clinical setting?

performance by helping to overcome the limits of human cognition. In spite of
gains achieved with these systems, significant problems remain, including
unexpected complexity and sometimes harmful effects, and persistent use of
paper-based cognitive artifacts. This panel will explore current research that
is meant to help us better understand the implications of clinical decision
support and cognitive support, and develop novel approaches that are intended
to take better advantage of the complementary capabilities of human and machine
cognition.

%X In September, 2009, AHRQ and NSF convened a workshop in which experts in the
fields of industrial and systems engineering (ISyE) and health care explored
critical areas of research at the intersection of both fields. The objectives
were to 1) articulate a vision for an ideal health care delivery system, 2)
determine why current efforts to apply ISyE knowledge to health care have not
resulted in meaningful change, and 3) propose a research and action agenda that
should be pursued to enable the field of ISyE to substantially contribute to
the realization of an ideal health care delivery system. This paper presents
the vision of the ideal health care delivery system and elements of the
research agenda that are salient to the field of human factors and ergonomics
(HFE). The ideal health care delivery system was defined as one that is new,
patient-centered, and engineered. The research agenda emphasized knowledge
innovation related to systems monitoring, modeling, and modification, but also
included items related to transfer of existing ISyE knowledge and integration
and prioritization of knowledge in both fields. Recognizing that human factors
and ergonomics is much larger than ISyE, this paper is also presented to the
HFES community to identify which other perspectives may need to be included.

%X Distractions and interruptions are frequently mentioned as sources of errors
in healthcare research, and laboratory research has shown that they can disrupt
cognition. However, the current evidence that distractions and interruptions
cause patient harm is mixed. In two studies in an intensive care unit, we
investigated whether and when distractions and interruptions might lead nurses
to forget critical care tasks. Study 1 was an observational study using a
mobile eye tracker. It investigated which properties of an interruption
influence resumption times and how nurses manage distractions and
interruptions. Study 2 was a controlled experiment in a full-scale patient
simulator. It investigated whether reminders improve nurses' ability to
remember routine tasks when multitasking and resume interrupted routine tasks.
We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the studies.

%X While the potential benefits of computerized provider order entry (CPOE) are
well recognized, little is known about how prescribers have integrated
electronic medication ordering into other aspects of patient care. As part of a
larger investigation of computerized medication alerts, we observed and
opportunistically interviewed 20 primary care prescribers at a major Veterans
Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). Participants were recruited from each of the
VAMC's 5 primary care clinics and included physicians, nurse practitioners, and
clinical pharmacists. Prescribers were observed as they ordered mediations via
the CPOE system during routine patient care. In total, observations included 91
routine patient encounters across 66.5 hrs of observation. This paper provides
illustrative case examples of how prescribers have integrated CPOE into
medication decision-making processes and other patient care tasks. Results
demonstrate that CPOE workflow varies widely among prescribers. In addition,
results indicate that there are trade-offs associated with using CPOE with the
patient in the exam room versus outside of the exam room. Findings may have
implications for provider-patient relationships, workflow efficiency, and
medication safety, and may ultimately enhance the effectiveness of CPOE in
primary care.

practice behaviors. However, it is unclear how best to support the development
of self-assessment skills, particularly in the health care domain. Exploration
of population-based data is one method to enable health care providers identify
deficiencies in overall practice behavior that can motivate quality improvement
initiatives. At the University of Virginia, we are developing a decision
support tool to integrate and present population-based patient data to health
care providers related to both clinical outcomes and non-clinical measures
(e.g., demographic information). By enabling users to separate their direct
impact on clinical outcomes from other factors out of their control, we may
enhance the self-assessment process.

%X As part of an organization's safety management strategy, it is important to
assess the level of safety climate with a valid instrument. The aim of this
study is to investigate the psychometric properties of the Hospital Survey on
Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) based on a sample of clinical staff from
Scottish acute hospitals and to determine the suitability for Scottish
healthcare setting. The data were collected from 1966 clinical staff (estimated
22% response rate) from one acute hospital from each of seven Scottish Health
Boards. In order to test the psychometric properties of the questionnaire, a
split-half cross-validation technique was used. The data were randomly split
into two, and Exploratory (EFA) and Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were
conducted on the calibration and validation data sets to investigate and check
the original US model fit from a Scottish sample. EFA results showed a 10
factor optimal measurement model. The CFA were then performed to compare the
model fit of two alternative models (10 factor alternative model vs. 12 factor
original model). It was demonstrated that both factor structures performed
equally well in a Scottish sample. Furthermore, reliability analyses of each
component yielded satisfactory results. Therefore no modifications are required
to the original 12 factor model which is suggested for use since it would allow
researchers the possibility of cross-national comparisons.

%X The aim of this symposium is to present and discuss recent research on the
factors shaping safe and efficient performance in the operating theatre. Ten
years ago, it was not generally accepted that a significant number of surgical
patients were harmed not as a result of underlying illness or disease but as a
result of their treatment. Detailed incident analyses and studies of behavior
in the operating theatre revealed that factors such as decision making,
situation awareness, coordination and leadership play a contributory role in
the multifaceted nature of adverse events.
   The papers included in this symposium address these issues applying a
spectrum of theoretical and methodological approaches. The emergent findings of
these studies have important implications for future research as well as
training and organizational design. For design recommendations to be useful in
clinical practice they require an in-depth understanding of the strengths and
vulnerabilities pertaining to the clinical work environment. This is reflected
by the fact that this symposium brings together teams of clinicians and human
factors experts in discussing their most recent research.

(undirected talk to relay relevant information or comment on the performance of
real-time self behavior) for effects on team interaction and performance in 27
anesthesia teams in the clinical setting. Immediate reactions to team
monitoring and talking to the room were investigated by means of lag sequential
analysis. As expected, we found that in high performing teams, immediate
consequences of team monitoring were speaking-up and providing unsolicited
assistance. Talking to the room led to further talking to the room and
substituted explicit coordination. The results highlight the relevance of team
monitoring and talking to the room for team coordination and performance in
dynamic healthcare environments.

%X Efforts to reduce adverse event rates in healthcare have revealed the
importance of identifying the essential non-technical (cognitive and social)
skills for safe and effective performance and developing tools for rating and
training those skills. The focus of studies to date has been surgeons,
anaesthetists, or the whole team, with less attention paid to other
professionals. The aim of the study was to develop a behavioural rating system
for non-technical skills of the scrub practitioner (nurse/technician). This
paper reports an interview study, as part of a task analysis, to identify the
critical non-technical skills for this role, and the development of a prototype
behavioural rating system. Experienced scrub practitioners (n = 25) and
consultant surgeons (n = 9), from four Scottish teaching hospitals, were
interviewed using a semi-structured design. Data that described generic
non-technical skills were extracted from the interview transcripts and
thereafter, psychologists and panels of perioperative practitioners (n = 4)
used an iterative process to develop a skills taxonomy. Three categories of
non-technical skills were identified as critical for safe and effective scrub
practitioner performance. These were; situation awareness, communication and
teamwork, task management. Three underlying skill elements for each of the
three categories were labeled by the expert panels and they provided examples
of good and poor behaviours for each of these skill elements, drawing on their
domain knowledge. The reliability and psychometric properties of the prototype
skills taxonomy and behaviour rating system are currently being tested using
standardized, simulated scenarios.

%X Background: There is widespread recognition that non-technical skills,
including leadership, are essential for an effective, efficient and safe team
performance. However, the empirical literature on specific skills required for
effective leadership within the intraoperative setting is limited and
inconclusive. Method: Observations (n=23 operations) were conducted in
operating rooms (OR) from three teaching hospitals in Scotland to gather data
on intraoperative leadership behaviours. This analysis focused on the role of
the lead surgeon. These were coded according to a task- and team-oriented
structure, using seven leadership constructs identified in the surgical
literature. Results: Leadership behaviours were categorised with acceptable
inter-rater reliability. The analysis showed that as intraoperative leaders,
surgeons exhibited both task- and team-oriented behaviours. They most
frequently engaged in team-oriented leadership behaviours, namely 'guiding and
supporting' followed by 'communication and coordination' behaviours.
Discussion: This study is the first step in developing an empirically derived
scale to measure and evaluate surgeons' intraoperative leadership. Future
studies will investigate the relationship between the leadership behaviours
identified here, team performance, and patient safety outcomes. Better
understanding of intraoperative leadership can lead to improved surgical team
performance, which could impact patient safety in the operating room.

%X Preventing errors that threaten patient safety is a priority within all
healthcare specialties. One approach is to increase the resiliency of
healthcare systems by improving error management processes and by making
systems more error tolerant. Research has shown that a key marker of surgical
excellence is the ability of a surgical team to successfully manage errors and
unexpected events during surgery. Proactively improving error management during
surgery is difficult however because little is known about the cognitive
mechanisms involved in error recovery or the situational factors that impact
successful error management processes. This paper describes a systematic
analysis of errors and error management processes during cardiovascular
surgery. Results are used to develop a theoretical framework that captures the
complexity of cognitive and situational factors involved in error management.
The utility of this model in identifying areas within healthcare systems that
can be redesigned to improve patient safety will be discussed.

five-month period. In thirteen of the 26 observations, both observers stood in
the same location and in the other thirteen cases the observers stood in
different locations within the operation room (OR). The surgical cases
typically last five hours and were conducted in multiple operating rooms within
the hospital and with mixed surgical teams. There was an average of 8.49 flow
disruptions per hour related to work system factors with an average of 42.45
disruptions per case. Results revealed that inter-rater reliability in
identifying work system factors that disrupted surgical flow was roughly 87%
when observers were standing in the same location. However, when standing in
different locations, the reliability decreased to an average of 75%.

%X The operating room is one of the most complex work environments in
healthcare; it is estimated that at least 7% of adverse events due to medical
error occur in the operating room. Flow disruptions are events that cause a
"break" in the primary surgical task, or the loss of any team member's
situational awareness. From the "systems" perspective, flow disruptions are
often a symptom of a latent failure somewhere within the system. An empirical
link between flow disruptions and surgical errors in the OR has been
established; therefore, identifying and classifying the specific flow
disruptions present during different types of procedures should facilitate the
development of evidence-based interventions. The goal of this study was to
identify and classify flow disruptions during laparoscopic cholecystectomy
(camera-assisted gallbladder removal) and open inguinal and umbilical hernia
repair procedures. Results of this study include revealed seven categories of
disruption that emerged inductively from the data collected. These were:
communication, coordination, external/extraneous source, training/supervisory,
equipment/supplies, patient factors, and environment.

%X The present study investigates performance consequences of a new approach of
automated support for surgeons. "Navigated-Control" (NC) represents an
advancement of image-guided navigation that does not only support the surgeon
in navigating through a patient's anatomy, but also can stop the surgical
device if it comes too close to risk structures which need to be protected to
ensure patient safety. It is explored, how NC affects different aspects of
surgical outcome, workload and stress, and situation awareness. Fourteen
advanced students of medicine performed a simulated Mastoidectomy with and
without NC support. The results reveal that NC support can reduce both, the
risk of intra-operative injuries, as well as the physiological stress level of
surgeons. However, "cost effects" emerged with respect to subjective workload,
and a reduced spare capacity compared to unsupported surgeries. These latter
effects do not seem to be related to the principle of NC but technical
constraints of current implementations.

%X The purpose of this paper is to describe an ergonomic assessment of a da
Vinci Surgical Robot. The use of surgical robots has significantly enhanced the
surgeon's control and visualization during minimally invasive surgery. In turn,
these technological advances have translated into significant benefits to the
patients compared to traditional laparoscopic techniques. However, use of
surgical robots requires that surgeons sit for extended periods at a surgical
console from which they control the robotic arms and view the surgical
procedure through a high resolution viewer. This can lead to sustained trunk
and neck flexion, resulting in discomfort in those regions. The system was
analyzed through observational assessment and anthropometric modeling. The
results of the analysis indicate that the current adjustability of the da Vinci
console is sufficient for a large majority of the population, but individuals
shorter than 60" or taller than 72" face challenges in using the system.

%X Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and preventable
adverse event with hospitalized patients described as being at 100 times
greater risk than people in the community. The purpose of this study was to
compare the ease-of-use and required cognitive effort during the use of two
chemoprophylaxis assessment and assignment protocols to identify the protocol
with the highest usability and effectiveness. The two compared protocols
consisted of the current risk stratification (protocol R) and a proposed
intent-to-treat method (protocol I). The purpose of the intent-to-treat
protocol was to use clinical pathway methodology to reduce the amount of
cognitive effort utilized by resident physicians during the treatment of VTE.
Forty-one medicine residents participated in an online comparison of the two
different protocols (R and I) for treating VTE prophylaxis using six unique
patient scenarios. Statistical analyses found that protocol I (52.8 sec.)
produced significantly faster mean scenario completion times than protocol R
(79.6 sec.) along with significantly (33%) more correct chemoprophylaxis
assignment outcomes over all six scenarios and scenario difficulty levels
(easy, medium or hard). The results of this study indicate that protocol I
enhances performance by reducing cognitive errors, completion time and
unnecessary protocol steps by using the proposed clinical pathway methodology.

%X The management of chronic disease by patients in the home care setting can
involve a varied and complex set of tasks. Food allergy, a chronic and
potentially life-threatening condition, is used as a case study to explore the
role that human factors engineering can play to improve the continuity of care
of patients. In order to gain insight into the cognitive demands involved in
the management of this chronic disease, a cognitive task analysis was conducted
to identify and characterize the critical decision making tasks confronting
food allergy patients. This can provide valuable input to the design and
development of tools and resources for use by the clinical practitioner and
patient alike. Such tools can: assist the clinical practitioner with teaching
patients; assist patients in daily tasks involved in managing their condition;
and assist patients (or their families) in teaching others who may care for a
pediatric patient with food allergy. It is hoped that such an improvement in
continuity of care can lead to better disease management by patients.

%X With the heightened interest on medication mix-ups in the media,
improvements to patient health and safety are a natural focus for research in
medical human factors. Specifically, this project sought to answer the question
'Does Color Matter?' with respect to medication containers/labels and their
contribution to look-a-like medication mix-ups. Participants were asked to rate
the perceptual similarity of pairs of medication ampoules and vials. Ratings
were analyzed using Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS). A three dimensional
solution provided the best fit of the results. Participants rated medication
ampoules as highly similar if they shared the same glass color (dimension 1),
label color (dimension 2), and label pattern (dimension 3). Ratings of
medication vials were similar if they had similar glass color (dimension 1),
label pattern (dimension 2) and label color (dimension 3). The results of this
study show that color is an important feature used by nurses when judging
medications on their similarity. Discussion centers on the practical
implications of the results on medication look a-like confusions.

%X Preventable adverse events are one of the leading causes of patient
mortality in hospitals. Many of these adverse events occur in Intensive Care
Units (ICUs) where nurses often work under cognitive, perceptual, and physical
overloads. One contributing factor to these overloads is the display of
treatment orders, monitoring information, and equipment status on numerous,
spatially separated information displays. If these separate displays were
combined into a single integrated display at the bedside, the display could
potentially reduce nursing workload and improve nurse awareness of the
patients' treatment plans and physiological status. We performed a study with
three parts. First, we observed ICU nurses at work and found that task-relevant
information was often presented in a sub-optimal format, it was unavailable at
the point of care and/or it was laborious to retrieve. Second, we designed an
integrated information display that presents the information needed by nurses
at the patient bedside in a more optimal format. Finally, we evaluated
paper-based prototypes of both the integrated display and existing ICU displays
with pilot participants. The results for participants in a pilot study showed
that nurses using the integrated display could answer questions about the
patient's status and treatment significantly faster and more accurately.
Integrated displays could potentially reduce adverse events in ICUs and reduce
cognitive overloads.

to provide 11,700 supportive living resident suites over the next decade.
Before finalizing the design standards and guidelines for these facilities, a
mock-up residential suite was constructed, outfitted with all necessary
furnishings and equipment, and used to evaluate the proposed design. Evaluation
of the physical space and accessibility for residents' and clinical tasks were
accomplished using simulation, think aloud protocols and extensive debriefing
sessions. Scenarios were created that focused on commonly-occurring tasks
identified by frontline staff as being problematic for both residents and
staff. These scenarios were then carried out by seniors and a variety of
healthcare professionals to simulate expected room usage. Evaluation of the
scenarios indicated that sufficient space was available in the design; however,
areas prone to congestion were also identified. Recommendations to improve the
design of the residential suite were made to improve accessibility (of
cupboards, light switches and electrical outlets), storage (of power scooters /
wheel chairs), and bathroom configuration (of emergency pull cord and grab bar
locations).

%X The current literature shows a growing awareness that high-quality handover
practices (i.e. mechanisms for transferring information, responsibility, and
authority) are critical to ensure continuity of care and patient safety.
Inadequate patient handover consistently appears as a factor contributing to
adverse events, across healthcare settings and practitioners. Impacts of
inadequate handover include delays in diagnosis and treatment, redundant
activities such as additional procedures and tests, longer hospital stays,
decreased patient and provider satisfaction etc. It has been pointed out that
handover processes are highly variable in quality and structure and that there
seems to be a lack of consensus about the primary purpose of patient handover
resulting in diverse measurement approaches and a broad spectrum of
interventions to improve handover. The aim of this symposium is to present
recent conceptual, empirical and implementation work on patient handover in a
variety of clinical settings and to discuss implications for patient safety.

prescriptive model for conducting handoffs. This exploratory pilot study
re-analyzed an existing repository of de-identified field notes on handoffs to
answer the question: How do healthcare personnel react when deviations from
prescriptive handoff practices are detected? We discuss how these findings
suggest that prescriptive interventions may fail without having clear
expectations for peer-to-peer positive feedback for appropriate deviations
during contingencies and negative feedback when deviations increase risks to
what is judged to be an unacceptable level.

%X The need for 24 x 7 x 365 service in emergency departments (EDs) requires
physicians and other health professionals to work in temporally delimited
shifts. Handoffs between on-coming and off-going workers at shift changes are
used to bridge gaps in care and to prepare the on-coming party to assume the
ongoing work of care safely and effectively. We audio-recorded shift change
conversations at 4 North American EDs and analysed them using a conversational
framework. We compare these conversations among ED workers to reports of
similar handoff conversations occurring between ED physicians and hospitalist
at the time of patient admission. We found receiving parties in ED shift
changes to be more active in the elicitation of information, rather than being
passive recipients of information. This suggests that a co-construction or
distributed cognition framing of handoffs may be more useful in understanding
and improving handoffs than the information transfer framing commonly assumed
by medically oriented researchers, at least in this setting.

%X A simulation-based training intervention to improve patient handovers
between anesthesia providers (APs) and Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) nurses
(RNs) in adult (VUH) and pediatric (VCH) PACUs, was developed, implemented, and
evaluated. The intervention included didactic webinars, an electronic handover
report tool, a 2-hour simulation-based training session and a 1-hr "refresher"
course several months later. Training focused on interpersonal skills and
overcoming obstacles to effective handovers. Trained nurses observed and
evaluated 981 actual PACU handovers over 12 months using a standardized rating
tool. A different blinded observer scored pre- and post-training simulated
handovers. A culture survey was administered before and after the intervention.
After training, handover quality improved significantly with more than 70% of
handovers rated as "effective" in both PACUs (P&lt;0.001). The training status
of the handover giver (AP) was the critical determinant of handover
effectiveness. Following full implementation, new (untrained) clinicians
performed effective handovers suggesting culture change and/or implicit
training.

framework of distributed cognition. Forty handoffs between nurses, with
experience ranging from 3 to 40 or more years, were observed within the
intensive care unit of a pediatric hospital. The findings revealed that a
variety of resources were referred to and appear mildly correlated with handoff
durations, where more experienced individuals displayed a greater frequency of
resource use in prolonged handoffs.

%X Doctors' shift handovers have not been well documented, so handovers in an
acute medical assessment unit (AMAU) were examined by conducting a hierarchical
task analysis (HTA). To construct the HTA, activities doctors engaged in
pre-handover, during handover, and post-handover were observed. Interviews and
a focus group were also conducted to create the HTA. Findings showed that there
are critical tasks that should be completed at each phase of the handover
process. But these were sometimes omitted, especially in the pre-handover
stage, resulting in extended or delayed handover meetings. Doctors believed
that various safety nets were in place to catch any omitted information.
Post-handover activities involved prioritizing tasks. However, doctors who had
received handover believed that their period of responsibility and
accountability for transferred patients was likely to be too short, and
therefore expressed that prioritizing tasks for every patient was inefficient.
Future research should examine handovers in the context of organizational
resilience, and include other clinical staff that influence the information
provided at handover.

%X This study explored an extended three-dimensional Fitts' law that is more
suited for the pointing task than the conventional Fitts' law. The experiments
were conducted under the manipulation of the distance to the target, size of
the target, and direction of the target's location that can be described by two
angles, &theta;1 and &theta;2. Considering the starting point as the center of
coordinates, &theta;1 is the angle between the positive z-axis and the target
location and &theta;2 is the angle between the positive y-axis and the
projected target location on the x-y plane. From the experimental results, we
confirmed that all four variables significantly affect the movement time. As we
extended the index of difficulty of the conventional Fitts' model by
incorporating &theta;1 and &theta;2, we established an extended Fitts' model
that showed better accordance with the empirical data than the conventional
Fitts' model, in terms of the r{sup:2} and the standard error of the residual
between the measured movement time and the predicted value.

cognitive processes and for quantitatively predicting when users are typing
Korean text messages on mobile phones using both hands. First, we observe the
behaviors of 10 subjects, when the subjects enter keypads with both hands.
Then, basing upon MHP, we categorize the behaviors into perceptual, cognitive,
motor operators, and then we analyze those operators. After that, we use the
critical paths to model three task sentences. Also, for the sake of comparison
between the actual data and the results predicted from our CPM-GOMS model, we
empirically tested 30 subjects and concluded that there were no significant
differences between the predicted values and the actual data. With the CPM-GOMS
model, we can observe the human information processes composed on the physical
and cognitive processes. Also we verified that the CPM-GOMS model can be well
applied to predict the users' performance when they input text messages on
mobile phones using both hands by comparing the predicted total task time with
the real execution time.

%X In previous research, Jastrzembski &amp; Charness (2007) estimated weighted
mean values for nine information processing parameters for older adults using
the Card, Moran, &amp; Newell (1983) Model Human Processor (MHP) model, and
successfully validated a subset of those parameters with age-specific GOMS
models for two mobile phone tasks across two mobile phone devices. The current
research extends the mapping of MHP parameters to the ACT-R cognitive
architecture (e.g., Anderson, 2007), and transitions age-specific MHP
parameters into theoretically-plausible ACT-R models of older adult
performance. We argue that the incorporation of theoretically-motivated MHP
parameters into ACT-R will produce better fits to empirical data than default
ACT-R parameters, and the use of those theoretically-principled parameter
values will provide designers with more precise insight concerning why
hardware/software designs/devices work or fail as a function of age. We test
these hypotheses in the same mobile phone domain used to validate the
age-specific MHP parameters in previous research and our findings demonstrate
that age-specific ACT-R models using elemental MHP parameter values achieve
better fits than default ACT-R parameters. This research may provide designers
and human factors engineers the ability to inspect details of human performance
at a finer grain of resolution than is currently available, help determine the
cause of specific errors resulting from hardware/software design, cognitive
workload, or user characteristics, and support the development of age-sensitive
technologies.

%X Existing workload algorithms based on the Multiple Resources Theory (MRT)
provide an effective approach for diagnosing operator overload caused by
interference among concurrent tasks, however, their ability to handle overload
in single task conditions is limited. We argue a time-based algorithm,
developed on the Information Processing (IP) model of workload (Hendy, Liao,
&amp; Milgram, 1997), provides a viable solution to address this limitation. In
this study, we proposed a new algorithmic implementation of the IP model in the
context of task network modeling. The new algorithm was implemented in a JAVA
program and tested on an existing model of a Bakan vigilance task. The results
obtained from the new algorithm demonstrated the feasibility of this solution.
By integrating resource-based and time-based algorithms, analysts will be able
to diagnose more accurately system performance breakdowns caused by operator
overload.

%X Breakdowns in complex systems often occur as a result of system elements
interacting in ways unanticipated by analysts or designers. In systems with
human operators, human-automation interaction associated with both normative
and erroneous human behavior can contribute to such failures. This paper
presents a method for automatically generating task analytic models
encompassing both erroneous and normative human behavior from normative task
models. The resulting model can be integrated into a formal system model so
that system safety properties can be formally verified with a model checker.
This allows analysts to prove that a human automation-interactive system (as
represented by the model) will or will not satisfy safety properties with both
normative and generated erroneous human behavior. This method is illustrated
with a case study: the operation of a radiation therapy machine. In this
example, a problem resulting from a generated erroneous human action is
discovered. Future extensions of our method are discussed.

%X NASA's Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) will provide transportation for
crew and cargo to and from destinations in support of the Constellation
Architecture Design Reference Missions. Discrete Event Simulation (DES)
modeling is one of the design methods NASA employs to estimate crew performance
in the CEV. During the early development of the CEV, NASA and its prime Orion
contractor Lockheed Martin (LM) sought out an effective, low-cost method for
developing and validating human performance DES models. This paper focuses on
the method developed while creating a DES model for the Rendezvous, Proximity
Operations, and Docking (RPOD) phase to the International Space Station. Our
approach to validation was to attack the problem from several fronts. First, we
began the development of the model early in the CEV design stage. Second, we
adhered to NASA's modeling and simulation development standards. Third, we
involved the stakeholders, NASA astronauts, subject matter experts, and NASA's
modeling and simulation development community throughout. Fourth, we applied
standard and repeatable methods to ensure the model's accuracy. Lastly, we
applied the data from a separate human-in-the-loop RPOD simulation, which
provided us an additional means to estimate the validity of the model. The
results showed that a majority of the DES model was an accurate representation
of the current CEV design.

%X A unique challenge for the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle is the need for a
novel cursor control device (CCD) that allows the crew to interact with display
formats while seated and restrained. Display formats will contain "controllable
elements" that will be used for input by astronauts, and will most likely not
be laid out in a rectilinear grid. A four-way "caged" castle switch on the CCD
was designed to travel only to controllable elements toward decreasing
erroneous cursor movements. The ability of the four-way castle to intuitively
navigate the cursor from a user perspective is a vital consideration. A cursor
expectations study was conducted to understand dominant user expectations for
CCD movements when controllable elements are not arranged on a rectilinear
grid. Algorithms were developed that governed cursor movement in such a way as
to match the dominant user expectations, to support the development of user
mental models for cursor behavior, and to guide designers when laying out
display formats.

multiple uniquely identified objects in a dynamic environment similar to ATC.
The experimental task consisted of tracking a set of moving objects for twenty
seconds. The objects were 6-character strings; three letters followed by three
numbers. After tracking the objects for twenty seconds, the participants were
instructed to locate a target-object. The time required to find the target
object was recorded. The number of objects and the magnitude of direction
changes (entropy) were manipulated. We found (1) a highly significant effect of
increasing response times as a function of number of objects, (2) a marginally
significant effect of entropy, decreasing response times as a function of
entropy, and (3) a significant effect of displacement, increasing response
times as a function of objects' displacement.

%X Long-duration space flight demands prolonged exposure to a myriad of
stressors which manifest and interact over time. Despite a significant body of
work dedicated to identifying, mitigating, and managing the effects of stress
on performance, a clear theoretical foundation explicating the ways in which
interactions among stressors occurs, as well as how and when stress develops
chronically remains unclear. Additionally, it is not yet well understood how
such temporal and interactive effects impact performance at multiple-levels of
analysis, including both individual and team performance. The current paper
presents an innovative theoretical approach for unpacking these complex
relationships, forming a foundation for understanding their impact on dynamic
episodes of individual and team performance.

%X A computational model was developed to predict the spatial-cognitive
difficulties imposed when the operator must transform information along up to 6
degrees of freedom between a display (viewed at different orientations), and
either a cognitive understanding or a compensatory control. The model applies
to pilots, robotics operators, navigators or surgeons using endoscopic
procedures. Penalties (in workload, errors or time) in the frame of reference
transformation (FORT) are based on psychological findings in spatial cognition,
such as mental rotation, depth compression, population stereotypes and verbally
mediated strategies. We present the graphical user interface for exercising the
model; then show how we have applied it to an astronaut space-shuttle, Hubble
rendezvous sequence. Finally we validate the model against two existing data
sets, one for cognition and one for control. The model could be used as the
basis for both a design analysis tool and a real-time operator aiding system.

%X Cognitive architectures such as ACT-R and EPIC are being applied to human
factors research problems with increasing frequency. However, it is unclear
whether such systems can model continuous motor tasks that were once staples in
the field but have since been largely displaced by more cognitively-oriented
problems. Recent research on a challenging continuous motor control task has
revealed interesting patterns in skill acquisition that appear compatible with
the learning mechanisms present in ACT-R. However, what was not clear was
whether ACT-R could model expert performance in a high-frequency motor control
task. Unmodified, ACT-R could not. However, by making some small changes in
ACT-R's motor system and capitalizing on ACT-R's ability to imagine visual
objects, ACT-R was able to achieve expert-level performance in this task.
Whether ACT-R will be able to mirror the skill acquisition data is still an
open question.

%X Tactical decision-making may be an emotional experience for an operator.
Emotion, whether extrinsic or intrinsic to the task, may bias attention to task
critical information. The current study used a feedback manipulation to induce
positive and negative affect (PA and NA) during a decision-making task
requiring information search. In a task based on a rescue scenario,
participants were randomly assigned to either a "success" or "failure"
condition and instructed to evaluate the costs and benefits of different routes
along separate legs of the rescue mission, similar to reaching a "fork in the
road." Feedback was effective in manipulating emotion. PA and NA were
significantly correlated with information sampling frequencies, but no general
mood-congruent bias was found. Instead the role of mood appears to depend on
the general affective context, a finding interpreted in relation to the
mood-as-input hypothesis. The practical relevance and limitations of the study
are discussed.

%X Studies of "choking under pressure" suggest novices choke because attention
is distracted away from the primary task. In contrast with the traditional
research on stress and performance, where additional resources made available
with increasing skill can ameliorate the effects of stress, experts are thought
to degrade because stress draws attention to, and disrupts, previously
proceduralized performance. Two kinds of dual-tasks, extraneous and
skill-focused, were used to examine skill-based differences in attentional
demands of a live-fire, handgun shooting task. Expert and novice police
officers completed shooting trials under moderate time pressure. Contrary to
choking research findings, the performance of experts was not adversely
affected by skill-focused attention whereas novices were. This pattern was also
reflected in a range of process measures. The results challenge currently
accepted explanations of choking under pressure, and suggest that the degree to
which expert performance is cognitively mediated may be greater than previously
assumed. Implications for traditional theories of skill acquisition and for
training to perform in stressful environments are discussed.

%X In this study, 35 women and 18 men completed a detailed questionnaire in
order to determine the possible role emotion and individual differences have on
the decision to commute by bicycle. Measured affect regarding cycling did not
significantly correlate with support for pro-cycling policies. There was,
however, a significant interaction between affect regarding cycling and gender
when predicting actual time spent using bicycles. Positive affect towards
cycling was significantly related to riding time for men, r = .56, but not
women, r = .03. This result is intriguing given that men expressed less support
for pro-cycling policies, less support for the environmental-social benefits of
cycling, but actually spent more time commuting by bicycle than women.
Marketing bicycle commuting may need to be considered in light of these gender
differences. For some users, a lofty pro-sustainability message may not be as
persuasive as advertising the thrills associated with bike commuting.

%X It has proved difficult to predict individual differences in vigilance from
standard psychometric tests. We report a study that explored the utility of a
multivariate battery in predicting vigilance on a task requiring monitoring of
a tactical display. A two-phase design was employed. Participants performed a
short vigilance task (SVT) prior to the longer criterion monitoring task. We
investigated the predictive ability of cognitive ability, personality,
performance on the SVT, and stress responses to the SVT. Four versions of the
criterion task were used, to test generalization of predictive validity. Key
predictors of vigilance were found to include ability, SVT performance, and
subjective task engagement and coping. Multiple regression analyses suggested
that together these predictors explained about 30% of the variance in vigilance
(with some differences for prediction of different task versions). Results are
discussed in relation to the resource theory of vigilance, and the practical
issues arising from selecting vigilant operators.

characterize the effects of sleep deprivation on individuals. In this paper, we
investigate the use of advanced fMRI modalities in resting wakefulness as
correlated with performance on a spatial working memory task after sleep
deprivation. Findings show that fatigue vulnerability to performance decrements
on complex spatial working memory tasks in healthy participants can be
predicted by fMRI images taken during resting wakefulness.

%X An auditory spatial Stroop paradigm was used to examine the effects of
semantic and spatial audio cue conflict on accuracy and response time.
Participants responded to either the semantic meaning or the spatial location
of a directional word, which was either congruent (i.e. the word "right" being
presented from the right) or incongruent (i.e. the word "right" being presented
from the left). Navigational strategy was also assessed to determine if
individual differences on this measure could affect responses to semantic or
location information. An interaction between task type and navigational
strategy indicated that people who preferred a verbal strategy responded faster
to semantic content and people who preferred a spatial strategy responded
faster to location information. Implications of these results are discussed in

%X As human-machine systems grow in size and complexity, there is a need to
understand and model how human attentional limitations affect system
performance, especially in large networks. As a first step, human-in-the-loop
experiments can provide the requisite data. Secondly, such data can be modeled
to provide insights by predicting performance with a large number of vehicles.
Accordingly, we first carried out an experiment examining human-UAV system
performance under low and high levels of task load. We also examined the
effects of a networked environment on performance by manipulating the number
and relevance of network message traffic from automated agents. Results showed
that in conditions of high task load, performance degraded. Moreover,
performance increased with the help of relevant messages, and decreased with
irrelevant, noise messages. Furthermore, a simple correlation showed a fairly
strong connection between working memory scores and our collected performance
data. Using regression to model this data revealed that a simple linear
equation does not provide for very accurate modeling of different aspects of
decision making performance. However, inclusion of the OSPAN working memory
capacity measure improves prediction capability considerably. Together, the
results of this study show that human-automation team performance metrics can
be modeled and used to predict performance under varying levels of traffic,
probability of assistance, and working memory capacity in a complex networked
environment.

%X Usability of an interface is an emergent property of the system and the
user; it does not exist independently of either one. For this reason,
characteristics of the user which affect his or her performance on a task can
affect the apparent usability of the interface in a usability study. We propose
and investigate, using a Wikipedia information-seeking task, a model relating
spatial abilities and performance measures for system usability. In the context
of World Wide Web (WWW) site usability, we found that spatial visualization
ability and system experience predicted system effectiveness measures, while
spatial orientation ability, spatial visualization ability, and general
computer experience predicted system efficiency measures. We suggest possible
extensions and further tests of this model.

%X Many truck drivers are injured each year due to falls while getting into and
out of their vehicles. Design guidelines for steps and handholds are not based
on biomechanical data and do not reflect a systems approach to design. As part
of a broader effort to improve ingress/egress safety, a laboratory study was
conducted to quantify driver postures and motions for a wide range of step and
handhold configurations. Data from thirty men and women with a wide range of
body size were analyzed to determine the location of the right hand and the
force exerted on the aft handhold during the initial phase of ingress. Drivers
grasped the external handhold at between 90 and 110 percent of stature above
the ground. Peak hand forces averaged 25 percent of body weight, although
heavier drivers did not exert significantly more force. Handhold position
affected hand force only when the lower step was relatively far from the

%X The use of computer keyboard and the associated work posture have been
reported as major risk factors for musculoskeletal symptoms in computer work,
but their specific interactions have not been clearly identified. In this
study, insurance bill processing workers at a state agency were monitored using
a time-lapse camera and software to track their computer activity during a full
workday. Then overall task distributions, postures, and keying performances
were measured and analyzed. Observations indicated that compared to other types
of tasks, typing constitutes the longest daily duty among these workers,
occupying 41% of their time. While workers are typing, their posture deviates
least frequently from a predetermined set of neutral angles; the peripheral
joints, which include the wrists and neck, deviate more frequently from neutral
than the central joints including the back and shoulders. Overall the results
indicate that typing tasks are less significantly associated with awkward
posture than other types of office work.

%X A laboratory study was conducted to determine the effect of display font
size on muscle activity, using surface electromyography (SEMG) and Rapid Upper
Limb Assessment (RULA). The study showed that volunteers performing the
experiment on small font size increased left hand flexor and neck extensor
muscles activity. There was also a significant difference in RULA grand scores
based on posture angle measures between the three tasks that subjects
performed. In addition, there was an effect of time on upper body posture and
subjective measures. There was no impact of font size on the dominant hand
deltoid and trapezius, or left and right hand extensor muscles. In general, the
results suggest that software developers should be sensitive to font size while
designing software. The results also suggest that computer users should have
better knowledge regarding the benefits of increasing the font size on their
displays.

quantified to determine how the size and/or the number of computer displays
(19", 24", 27.5", and dual 19" LCDs) influence the positioning of the computer
workstation components. Nineteen subjects performed a data entry task for 20

further as the size of display changed from 19" to 27.5" while maintaining the
viewing angle to the top and center of display at or near eye height. Preferred
position of the keyboard was not influenced by the display size. Results of
this study indicate that the dimensions or adjustability of a computer
workstation should be determined with consideration of the display size to
accommodate both the keyboard and the display at their most preferred

%X The primary purpose of this anthropometric study was to determine whether
conventional anthropometric databases of the US general population are
applicable to the population of US electric utility field workers. Based on
anecdotal observations, electric utility field workers seemed to be taller and
larger than the general population. Fourteen anthropometric measurements were
recorded from 187 male field workers from three US electric power utilities.
The anthropometric data from field workers were compared to seven well-known
conventional anthropometric databases for North American males, including
Central American. In general, the male field workers were taller and heavier
than the people in the reference databases for U.S. males. The field workers
were up to 2.3 cm taller and 10 to 18 kg heavier on average than the reference
databases. When designing for electric utility field workers, designers and
ergonomists should consider the population of intended users and the data from
this study.

%X Many electric utility fleet vehicles -- notably pickups and vans -- have
limited clearance between the accelerator and brake pedal for workers who wear
larger shoe sizes and even larger boots. The objectives of this study were to
establish a analysis protocol for determining safe clearance between pedals and
adjacent structures and then apply this protocol to existing utility fleet
vehicles to determine which vehicles have adequate clearance for safe driving.
Three sources of data were measured:1) detailed dimensions of the cabs of 16
common utility vehicles 2) anthropometric dimensions of 187 male electric
utility field and generating station workers, including boot size and 3) width,
length, and height of work boots, snow shoes, and rain slickers. Analysis
revealed that many common fleet vehicles provide inadequate foot clearance
between the pedals and adjacent structures, thus creating an unsafe driving
condition. The approach of data collection and analysis of this study can be
applied to other types of vehicles in order to determine the safety of pedal
design, particularly risk of "unintended acceleration."

an anthropometric study to know the workers physical characteristics and use
this information in the design or redesign of workstations. The study was
divided in three phases. The first one was the anthropometric study of 1342
automotive industry workers in northwest of Mexico. The study includes 40 body
dimensions of 1072 males and 270 females personalized to be used in the third
phase. These data are compared with anthropometric characteristics of
population reported in four Mexican places and a Colombian study. The second
phase includes the workstations and critical process requirement studies. In
the third one, a system is develop where combines workers physical
characteristics and workstations lay out and process requirements with the
purpose of assigned workers to the best suited workstation. The benefits of
this project are: increase workers satisfaction and product quality and reduce
economic, medical and union complains.

%X Studies have shown an association between intensive computer use and the
onset and development of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. However,
the evidence for possible health effects related to computer input device
design and operator anthropometry is limited. The aim of this study was to
systematically examine relationships between the current sizing of computer
input devices and key anthropometric differences, based on gender and race, in
adult computer users. Computer input devices appear to be designed based on
anthropometric clearance issues to accommodate the largest users (95th
percentile Western males). Based on this current design, less than 6.1% of the
worldwide population would "fit" the current pointing device and keyboard
design standards. Finger mass is a critical component for determining device
activation forces When comparing male and female hand anthropometry, finger
mass accounted for the largest anthropometric difference with the 50th
percentile females' hand only 73% the mass of the 50th percentile males'. With
respect to similarities, in virtually every aspect of seated workstation
anthropometry (i.e. furniture requirements), the 50th percentile Western female
very closely approximated the 50th percentile Asian male. The findings of this
study indicate that gender and race base differences in workstation design are
small relative to the differences in input device activation forces based on
hand anthropometry. It appears that the current "one size fits all" paradigm
used to design computer input devices may not be optimal. Smaller devices with
lower activation forces could benefit a large percentage of the world
population.

have been enhanced with advance materials, external power and electronics. Some
tools no longer have a mechanical connection between the hand and the work
object, e.g., joysticks, computer mice and hand controls used for robotic
surgery hand tools. Still it is widely recognized that tools must fit the user
and task to achieve best possible performance. Failure to consider the user and
task can result in acute or chronic injuries. Examination of tools from
different applications and from different times offers many important lessons
for tools designers and users. Panelist in this session will use historical and

restricted vertical space, such as underground low-seam coal mines (&lt; 1.2 m
vertical height). In such circumstances, stoop-walking and crawling must be
used. The objective of the current manuscript is to assess the difference
between free cadence walking versus stoop-walking (under a 1.2 m ceiling),
four-point crawling (hands and knees), and two-point crawling (knees only),
both with and without kneepads. Compared to upright walking, stoop-walking
resulted in a 24% reduction in gait velocity and exhibited reduced stride
length (1.04 versus 1.51 meters). Four-point crawling further slowed gait (to
0.50 m/s) and showed evidence of both trot-like and pace-like interlimb
coordination patterns. Gait speed for two-point crawling was only 0.32 m/s.

%X The emerging technology of virtual reality (VR) used in motor rehabilitation
might bring in challenges to elderly users' locomotion safety. The objective of
this study was to investigate such effects of virtual environment (VE) exposure
to the dynamic stability of lower extremities by using a head mounted display
(HMD). Twelve healthy elderly were randomly assigned with real world or VR
walking conditions. Maximum Lyapunov exponents (maxLE), which served as a
general measurement of dynamic stability, were assessed for real world walking,
VR walking in the initial phase and VR walking in the habituated phase.
Significant degradation of stability at the initial phase and remarkable
recovery of stability after VE habituation were found at five lower extremity
landmarks out of six, suggesting potential problems for the elderly to accept
VR based interventions and the importance of habituation to a new perturbation.
Meanwhile, across all walking conditions, dynamic stability was found to be
increased from ankles up to hip joints. And a novel method for computing maxLE
appeared to be reasonable and feasible for analyzing treadmill walking trials
which were relatively short.

%X The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how surface pressure
distribution at the hand/handle interface changes during gripping and pulling
and to enhance understanding of coupling between hands and grasped objects. Two
pressure-sensing arrays were wrapped around a 3.18 cm diameter cylindrical
handle which was fixed to a six-axis load cell. Six male subjects grasped the
fixed overhead instrumented handle and performed two exertion types: downward
pull exertions of 30, 60, and 90 percent of their measured grip strength and a
maximal isometric grip exertion. Consistent with previous studies, the greatest
pressure was exerted on the distal segments of the phalanges and at the base of
the thumb and palm during maximum isometric gripping. However, when pulling,
pressure on the palm (underside of the handle) was negligible. Most pull
pressure was distributed over the fingers unevenly in a bimodal distribution,
with the greatest pressures occurring on the proximal side of the hand followed
by the fingertips. This supports the hypothesis that friction acts through the
soft tissues of the fingers and creates an increased normal force in the
direction of proximal segments (i.e. "belt friction"). When the surface of the
handle is lumped into 5 equal zones, the observed bimodal trend is lost, with
the greatest average pressure observed at the top of the handle corresponding
to the pull direction. This discrepancy highlights the importance of resolution
when making conclusions about applied hand forces. Future research is needed to
investigate pressures on handles of different size and surface friction to
develop comprehensive models of hand/object coupling.

much of this prior research. The rig provides a means to simulate the effects
experienced by an operator using a right angle torque tools, in part, by
controlling the stiffness and mass properties of the rig. The rig also uses a

new tools and identify appropriate tool settings for specific task conditions,
such as joint hardness and target torque.

%X In activities of daily living and industrial tasks people encounter
obstructions in their environment that kinematically limit the postures that
they can achieve. These obstructions can also provide an opportunity for
additional support such as bracing with the hand, thigh or other body part. The
reaction forces acting at hand or body coupling, which are in addition to those
acting at the feet and task hand, may support some percentage of body weight,
allow modification to postural behavior strategies, or provide the ability to
generate oppositional forces relative to the task force. The effects of
kinematic constraints and associated bracing opportunities on isometric hand
force were quantified in a motion-capture study of 25 men and women with a
range of body size. The objective of this work was to quantify the effect of
bracing availability on force-exertion capability. Analyses of one-hand maximal
pulling tasks demonstrated that the additional force reaction surfaces enable
participants to exert more force at the task hand, by 31% on average, but these
values were greatly affected by the location and utility of the constraint and
the specified force direction.

speed on lifting kinematics and kinetics while lifting from a conveyor. The
inertial characteristics of a load moving on a conveyor have the potential to
influence lifting technique and low back stress. Participants in this study
lifted loads from a conveyor with four load speeds (0 m/s, 0.7 m/s, 1.3 m/s,
and 2.4 m/s) while trunk motions and ground reaction forces were monitored.
Results revealed that increasing horizontal load speed generated greater
sagittal angle and greater lateral ground reaction forces but significantly
lower trunk accelerations. The results suggested that the participants
maintained a more flexed trunk posture under the higher load speed conditions
and utilized the inertia of the load to reduce the peak accelerations of the
torso.

%X The purpose of current study was to investigate the effects of vertical
ground accelerations induced by simulated wave motions on trunk muscle
activation and trunk kinematics during manual materials handling tasks. Sixteen
subjects performed lifting, lowering and static weight-holding tasks under ten
different combinations of load mass and vertical acceleration of the ground
surface (ten different effective loads). The results showed that this effective
load had a significant effect on the peak sagittal plane angular acceleration
during lifting and peak sagittal plane angular deceleration during lowering.
The EMG results indicate that the boat motions tend to amplify the effects of
the slant of the lifting surface.

%X Previous studies have shown a variety of hand placement locations employed
by workers performing manual lifting tasks in industry. In this study,
participants used four different hand placement locations to lift a box of
variable weight and starting height. As they performed these lifts, the motions
of their torso were captured using the lumbar motion monitor and these trunk
kinematics were then input into the LMM low back injury risk assessment model.
The results showed significant effects of all three independent variables with
asymmetric hand placement locations generating the highest level of risk: 20%
in the symmetric, 5kg condition as compared to a high of nearly 40% under the
asymmetric, 10kg condition. These results indicate that hand placement is a
relevant variable to consider when designing manual materials handling tasks.

%X This study is based upon data collected for a large scale, multi-site
prospective cohort study of work-related low back pain (WLBP). The aim of this
study was to validate the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) and the 3D
Static Strength Prediction Model (3D SSPM) to predict the risk of WLBP.
Complete baseline and follow up data on job physical exposure and WLBP status
were available on 258 workers free of WLBP at baseline. Relationships between
job physical factors and incident cases of WLBP were analyzed using the Cox
proportional hazards model. There was evidence of association between load
moment and the Lifting Index calculated from the RNLE and incidence of WLBP,

%X Understanding of how back pain manifests has been the focus of a
considerable amount of research. Although there are several pathologies known
to cause low back pain, a significant number of individuals still fail to
receive a definitive diagnosis as to the cause of their pain. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between
the level of muscle inflammation measured using MRI and perceived pain ratings.
A lifting task was performed to achieve lumbar musculature fatigue, and induce
muscle pain. Prior to, immediately following, and 24-hours post lifting, pain
levels were recorded and MRI scans were conducted to document inflammation
levels in the lumbar muscles. All of the participants elicited significant
fatigue during the lifting task that resulted in considerable pain immediately
following and 24-hrs after the fatiguing exertions. Inflammation levels varied
by time-period, decreasing unexpectedly immediately following the lifting task,
but increasing 24-hrs following the lifting task. Although the results were not
definitive in establishing whether lumbar muscle inflammation is a cause of low
back pain, the results provided several interesting findings warranting further
investigation. Future work will need to focus on the temporal patterns of
muscular information and pain development.

%X The high number of discomfort and lost work time cases in one department of
a large pharmaceutical production facility, created a unique opportunity for
ergonomics study and intervention. The first step in the project identified the
three highest risk tasks using safety incident data. Each task was analyzed for
ergonomics risk factors. Interventions were developed and implemented for these
tasks. Biomechanical and subjective data were collected before and after all
interventions to assess the effectiveness of the interventions.
Three-dimensional dynamic flexion of the lower back data were collected using a
Lumbar Motion Monitor (LMM). Electrogoniometers were used to measure wrist
flexion. We used a force gauge, scale, and a tape measure to assess moments,
forces, and weight. Subjective data were collected by questionnaire. A
quantitative comparison of the subjective and electronic data showed reduced
risk factors for Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) of the wrist
and back for all three tasks. All the interventions were shown by empirical
methods to reduce the risk factors for WMSDs. The interventions were
permanently implemented.

%X In spite of strong epidemiological evidence associating neck or cervical
spine disorders with forceful arm exertions common at workplaces, effect of
such exertions as causative of neck musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) is
currently not well understood. In this study the effect of isometric lifting
tasks at elbow, shoulder and overhead heights on the activities of two major
neck muscles, sternocleidomastoid (anterior neck muscle) and upper trapezius
(posterior neck muscle), was evaluated by using electromyography (EMG). Thirty
healthy participants performed isometric lifting tasks exerting 25%, 50% and
75% of their respective maximum strengths at neutral and extended neck
postures. Activities of sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius increased with
the increase in the lifting weights and heights. Extended neck posture caused a
higher load on the neck musculature than the neutral posture. In conclusion,
this study demonstrates a positive load-response relationship between forceful
arm exertions and activation of the neck muscles.

%X The purpose of this study was to investigate the bilateral wrist postures of
gastroenterologists who perform routine colonoscopy. Gastroenterologists are
exposed to upper extremity musculoskeletal risk factors such as high pinch
forces, sustained muscle loading, and awkward postures; however, to date, no
studies have specifically quantified the wrist postures associated with routine
colonoscopy. Four experienced gastroenterologists performed 3 to 5 routine
colonoscopy procedures while bilateral wrist extension/flexion and radial/ulnar
deviation postures were measured using biaxial electrogoniometers. Peak (90th
percentile) wrist extension angles in both wrists (42.6&deg; left; 36.0&deg;
right), radial deviation for the left wrist (23.0&deg;) and ulnar deviation for
the right wrist (17.83&deg;) across all 4 phases of the colonoscopy procedures
exceeded the injury threshold limit values of 26.6&deg;, 17.8&deg;, and
12.1&deg;, respectively, based on carpal tunnel pressure (Keir et al., 2007).
The findings suggest that the wrist postures required during routine
colonoscopy may present a risk for musculoskeletal injuries at the wrist and
forearm.

%X In this paper, we evaluate the cognitive load of using a vibrotactile
posture feedback chair while performing standard office tasks. Our specific
application is seated posture guidance in the office environment. We have
instrumented a standard office chair with sensors and vibrotactile actuators to
detect and correct a user's seated posture in real-time. A pilot study with 20
subjects (age 25&plusmn;3.2 years, weight 71.6&plusmn;17.7kg) was conducted to
determine the impact on performance in a typing task while responding to the
vibrotactile feedback. We found that 55% of the subjects showed statistically
significant decrease in typing performance (p&lt;0.05) during the phases with
feedback compared to the phases without feedback. However, 70% of the subjects
exhibited an improvement in typing speed from the first to last feedback
phases. These findings suggest that although the feedback system temporarily
induces greater cognitive load, the load decreases with increased familiarity
with the feedback system.

%X Floor Coverers have a high prevalence of knee related injuries. The
objective of this study is to quantify whole body ergonomics exposure for Floor
Coverers in the greater Boston area. A total of 6213 observations (about 100
hours) were made on 49 Floor Coverers by 7 trained observers in 8 construction
sites. Awkward leg postures were common. "Kneeling/Crawling" was observed 61.2%
of the time. Nonneutral trunk postures were observed frequently. "Severe
Flexion" was observed 36.6% of the time, "Mild Flexion" 12.9%. "Manual Material
Handling" was observed most frequently during "Hardwood Floor" (36.1%). Hand
tools were used more frequently (32.6%) than power tools (5.2%). "Severe Trunk
Flexion" did not always lead to heavy trunk load with kneeling postures. Leg
postures should be considered before trunk postures were converted to trunk
loads. Awkward leg postures are a big problem for Floor Coverers. A majority of
the tasks happened near or on the ground.

interviews indicated that many of the items that they handle are heavy,
including cases of meat (up to 80 lbs), juice, water, and detergent. Management
and safety personnel who participated in a brainstorming focus group session
indicated key ergonomic issues include the weight of the meat cases, extended
reaching, and even more specifically, overhead reaching. Intervention ideas
discussed during the brainstorming indicated a need for mechanisms that reduce
reach distances by keeping product close to the order picking aisle and
mechanisms that relieve the physical burden of handling heavy product from
their storage slots onto the order-picker's pallet jack.

%X The primary goal of this study was to understand the adoption of specific
voluntarily used ergonomic interventions aimed at the musculoskeletal needs of
EMS workers. According to previous research in the areas of information
technology, acceptance and diffusion of innovation, worker's perceptions and
attitudes impact the adoption of an intervention. Prior research identified the
lateral transfer of patients as a frequently performed strenuous task performed
by EMS workers. The intervention introduced is a transfer-board, designed and
biomechanically validated to assist with these lateral transfers. In the
current study EMS workers were surveyed to determine which factors most closely
correlated with their intention to use the transfer-board. The data suggest
that the perception that it is easy to use, the patient is safer while using
the transfer-board, the transfer-board is compatible with other pieces of
equipment and the smoothness of the patient transfer when using the
transfer-board are all factors that may predict adoption.

contemporary trends in user interface research. This focus on total user
experience rather than a subset of user interaction necessitates more holistic
examinations of web interfaces and user response. To this end, a study
examining user response to a variety of usability and aesthetic web interface
elements was conducted. Eye tracking was used to measure participant fixation
on individual interface elements. These data were examined in order to expand
the field's understanding of how usability and aesthetics influence user
response to web sites. Significant effects were found for specific usability
and aesthetic elements, including use-oriented elements such as search boxes
and more abstract elements such as expressive aesthetic items. Based on these
results, implications for future research and theory are offered.

using performance, eyegaze and subjective measures. Background: Several forms
of image-based CAPTCHAs have recently been developed. Few studies have been
conducted to examine their usability. Method: Twenty participants received
training using four different CAPTCHAs: Asirra, ESP-PIX, SQ-PIX and
IMAGINATION. The participants were then asked to complete the CAPTCHA challenge
using five CAPTCHAs of each type. The participants were subsequently asked to
complete the computer system usability questionnaire (CSUQ) and the NASA Task
Load Index test. Upon completing all the tasks, the participants completed a
final post-test subjective questionnaire ranking the CAPTCHAs based on
preference. Results: Statistically significant differences among the CAPTCHAs
were found for all dependent variables other than task completion time.
Conclusion: Participants preferred Asirra and ESP-PIX to the other two
CAPTCHAs.

increase levels of trust and intent to purchase. Previous theory dictates that
trust is akin to certainties in the presence of uncertainty. Three easily
implementable website features were chosen to reduce uncertainty, thus creating
trust and in turn increase economic activity. Options on shopping websites of
(1) overnight delivery, (2) in-store pick-up, and (3) a live video stream of a
business's facilities were tested for effects on trust and usefulness via
survey. The results suggest there are significant increases in at least some
measures of trust and other correlates of purchasing behavior for all three
suggested website enhancements.

of user data, from multiple sources of data, at a much finer level of
granularity, and to be able to aid in a more sophisticated analysis, including
specific queries of usability data than a typical "manual"-based usability
analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate our User-Testing Database as applied to
a usability assessment of the Veterans Affairs (VA) My HealtheVet personal
health record. The usability test included 24 Veterans who completed a series
of scenarios in the usability lab at a Midwest Veterans Affairs Medical Center
(VAMC). The User-Testing Database facilitated reduction of data gathered from
video review, facilitator notes, and debrief notes into 1160 observations that
were sorted into conceptual bins and summarized for the designers of the
personal health record. From creation of the database to completion of the
reports took four months and did not require extensive knowledge of qualitative
analysis techniques. We argue a User-Testing Database can allow other usability
studies to increase the number of participants and the granularity of the data
without prohibitively increasing the amount of time and experience required to
process the data gathered.

%X The objective of this study was to better understand the knowledge and
opinions of managers in the American furniture manufacturing industry regarding
Human Factors and Ergonomics (HF/E) and to explore significant relationships
between company size and managers' awareness on HF/E. The furniture
manufacturing industry has a high occupational injury and illness rate and HF/E
awareness is vital to improve worker safety and health. A web-based survey was
used to gage managers' awareness of HF/E. Development, pre-test, and review
stages followed to design the final survey. Sixty-four managers participated in
the survey. This study shows the awareness level of managers depended on
company size. Smaller companies were less likely to provide HF/E training
programs to both managers and employees, additionally; smaller companies were
less likely to have a team or department for HF/E interventions or for
establishing HF/E programs in their organizations. The main reason for lower
commitment to HF/E in small companies is owners, managers, and employees had a
low awareness about the importance of HF/E to improve their occupational injury
and illness rates. For example, 75 percent of the managers surveyed rated their
HF/E knowledge level as poor, fair, or average. Some of the managers were not
aware of available information resources about HF/E. A considerable number of
managers believed that HF/E resulted in more regulations to follow and higher
cost in training new employees. Without managers' commitment and support, the
success of HF/E programs is not likely. In summary, our findings indicate
managers in small companies are not well informed of the importance HF/E
awareness plays in controlling their injury and illness rates. Therefore, we
feel managers of any sized company especially smaller companies should be
introduced to available HF/E resources and the benefits of HF/E.

factors associated with performance management systems between high- and
low-performing schools in Milwaukee Public Schools, a large urban school
district in southeastern Wisconsin. Specifically, this research investigated
school improvement planning and use of different types of academic data for
decision support from the viewpoint of school leadership. Interviews with
principals and observations of school improvement planning meetings were
conducted to identify and describe (1) dimensions of data and data use and (2)
the human and organization factors in school-based performance management
systems between high- and low-performing schools. Implications for
macroergonomic analysis in school-based performance management systems and

%X Agriculture is one of the most dangerous industries in terms of occupational
injuries, illnesses, and deaths. Agricultural safety training, injury
prevention programs, and safety regulations lag behind other comparable
industries. The present study involved a macro-ergonomic approach to understand
and improve safety climate on Colorado farms. Safety climate was defined as the
perceptions of employees regarding the way safety was managed, and the
subsequent safety behaviors that employees tend to engage in. Using a sample of
Colorado corn farmers, the first two phases of this study utilized survey and
interview data to establish that safety climate was important and valued, but
required better safety training implementation. The study's final phase
developed, implemented, and evaluated an educational safety seminar focusing on
the application of safety climate. By integrating macro-ergonomic methods with
the psychological construct of safety climate, this study cultivated safer work
practices in agriculture.

%X Assisted target detection (ATD) systems are designed to direct the user's
attention to relevant areas of the display, but the majority of the research
into the use of such systems does not consider the design of the cue itself.
Within a search and rescue (SAR) context, there is a possibility that cues
designed to facilitate effective search could in fact distract a SAR operator's
search of the terrain, reducing the probability of locating a crashed aircraft.
In order to determine if salience matters in the design of an ATD system for
video-based sensor systems, it is important to study the impact of highly
salient cues on visual search. In a previous experiment where the saliency of a
cue was varied using different levels of cue brightness in a search task with
static imagery, it was found that the more salient cues produced faster
response times without any detrimental effects on accuracy. In the present
experiment we used dynamic imagery from a SAR simulator. We found that cues of
different brightness improved the sensitivity (d') of participants when
compared to conditions in which no cues were available, but there was no
evidence of any differences between the different levels of cue brightness.
These findings suggest that cue brightness may not influence the salience of
cues as much as one might expect in the context of a full-motion simulation.
Other visual dimensions such as visual onsets or colour may potentially play a
larger role in determining the saliency of ATD system cues when used in a task
involving motion such as SAR.

%X How do people efficiently locate content in a display? We investigate the
effect of text layout on how people decide which area of a display to search
first. Using a visual search paradigm, participants were required to locate a
known target within a two-column display, in which items were grouped into
semantic clusters, and the physical distance between items varied. For 'mixed'
trials, the distance between items in each column was varied. Results showed
that participants preferred to search the sparser of the two columns first,
even though they were faster at locating the target in the denser column. This
finding suggests that participants were adopting an inefficient search strategy
for locating the target item. Discussion focuses on the implications for models
that assume people rationally adapt their search strategy to maximize the gain
of task-relevant information over time.

%X A variety of data rich complex domains stand to benefit from the
introduction of tactile displays that offload the visual and auditory
information channels. Yet, a better understanding of factors that affect
tactile information processing is needed to ensure the robustness of these
interfaces. Recent research has shown, for example, that the sense of touch can
be affected by phenomena that are analogous to visual change blindness, which
describes the surprising difficulty in detecting changes to a visual scene when
these changes coincide with masking stimuli or blank inter-stimulus intervals.
To date, tactile change blindness has been demonstrated only for changes in the
number of body locations where vibrations were presented. The present study
examined whether change blindness is observed also in the context of detecting
changes in vibration intensity and whether the introduction of a secondary task
during vibrotactile presentations exacerbates these effects. The findings show
that a 300-ms vibrotactile masking stimulus and a 600-ms "mudsplash" sequence
of stimuli significantly degrade performance in detecting coincident intensity
changes, as do intensity changes that occur gradually instead of abruptly.
Change detection was significantly worse in dual-task (vs. isolation)
conditions for only the "mudsplash" presentations. Implications of these
effects for the design of tactile displays that encode information in vibration
intensity are discussed.

%X The growing trend of using mobile phones and other in-vehicle technologies
(IVT) while driving has spurred research on driver distraction, its effects and
alleviation (Ashley, 2001; Young &amp; Regan, 2007). The present study used a
dual task in which 21 undergraduates navigated a mobile phone contact list for
a target name (secondary task) while playing a computer game representative of
driving (primary task). The phone menu was enhanced with two audio navigation
cues: traditional text-to-speech (TTS) and spearcons (i.e., compressed speech).
These cues were tested with and without visual display of the contact list.
Spearcons in conjunction with TTS enhanced performance on the primary task
while having no negative effect on the secondary task. Auditory menus reduced
perceived workload and increased subjective ratings. Results are discussed in
terms of multiple resources theory and practical mobile phone menu design.

%X Visual search is an integral part of functioning in everyday life and a
primary component of some occupational tasks. Older adults typically exhibit
longer response times on visual search tasks compared to younger adults.
Mechanisms proposed as explanations of these age-related differences include
general slowing of the speed of information processing, amount of internal
noise, attentional capacity, selective attention, and inhibition. This study
evaluated the possibility that age-related differences in visual search may be
partly due to older adults double checking to a greater degree than younger
adults. Older adults did in fact double check more so than younger adults.
Moreover, speed stress instructions reduced double checking behavior as well as
age-related differences in double checking.

%X As a result of continuous technological advances, information delivery is
becoming multi-modal and complex. In many professions (e.g., air traffic
control, combat operations) an abundance of information is delivered
simultaneously over the visual and auditory sensory channels resulting in
cognitive overload and leading to performance degradation over time. The
Multiple-Resource theory suggests that offloading information from overtaxed
sensory modalities to other modalities can reduce workload (Wickens, 2002). If
properly implemented, tactile displays -- i.e., devices used to present
information to the user by stimulating the skin -- may be a viable solution in
reducing sensory and cognitive overload from the visual and audio channels.
Shifting information to the tactile (touch) channel or judicious use of tactile
information in conjunction with auditory and/or visual cues can lead to a
reduction in cognitive and perceptual overload and an increase in positive
performance outcomes. The primary objective of this panel is to discuss the
most promising developments in tactile research and how the next steps can lead
to new application areas or to specific products. The panelists -- representing
academia, the military, and industry, can collectively speak to diverse tactile
information delivery methodologies, their respective applications, and
challenges for the path forward. Some applications have already been realized
in aviation, robotics, medicine, and commercial products and these will be
described. Ultimately, this panel session is expected to inspire interest in
tactile information delivery and to identify promising pathways for research
leading to new application areas and specific application products.

%X The System for Tactile Reception of Advanced Patterns (STRAP) is capable of
displaying complex information through tactile actuators on a user's torso.
Non-verbal communication requirements from a Military Operations in Urban
Terrain (MOUT) task and tactile design guidelines resulted greater than 60
distinct tactile symbols for communication and a context free grammar. This
empirical evaluation is the first step in validating the STRAP system as a
complement to traditional communication methods such as military hand and arm
signals and radio. Nine participants were trained on the entire tactile
language to a 90% criterion and were asked to utilize a small subset of the
vocabulary while completing room clearing tasks using a virtual desktop
simulation. The results show no significant difference in room clearing
performance when haptic versus verbal communications were provided, indicating
that the STRAP system shows promise as a complementary communication device.
Improvements to both the tactile display and symbols are discussed as a means
to improve recognition of haptic commands and overall system utility.

%X We investigated the influence of vehicle control (driver vs. passenger) on
postural activity and motion sickness in the context of a console video game.
Using a yoked control design, individuals participated as driver-passenger
dyads. Within dyads, individuals participated alone, with Driver sessions being
recorded and played back to corresponding Passengers. Passengers were more
likely than Drivers to report motion sickness. During game exposure, Drivers
tended to move more than passengers. Yet participants who later became motion
sick moved differently than those who did not, with changes in movement
variability of the head and torso. The results confirm that control of a
simulated vehicle reduces the risk of motion sickness, and that postural
instability precedes motion sickness. The results can be used to guide the
design of driving simulations and video games.

%X This study compared measures of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and
blood oxygen saturation (rSO2), during the performance of a 40-min vigilance
task. Observers monitored a simulated air-traffic control display for flight
path deviations which occurred in a unidirectional or a multidirectional
context. CBFV and rSO2 measures were secured from the medial cerebral arteries
in the left and right cerebral hemispheres and from the corresponding frontal
lobes, respectively. Performance efficiency was greater in the unidirectional
than the multidirectional condition and declined over time in both conditions,
more so in the multidirectional condition. This pattern of results was
paralleled in different ways by the two hemodynamic measures. A result of this
sort challenges the assumption of a close tie between cerebral blood flow and
oxygen saturation (Siesjo, 1978) and supports recent findings (Mintun et al.,
2001) that cerebral blood flow and oxygen levels are not tightly coupled in
active brain states.

%X The mental workload construct is examined along with visual workload in
order to discriminate the relationship between the converging constructs. Six
ocular activity variables were measured in order to test convergent and
discriminant properties with regards to visual and mental workload. Three pilot
crews flew six flight scenarios in which subjective and physiological mental
workload measures were analyzed across task difficulty and task differences
(pilot on-controls versus pilot off-controls). Results indicate less subjective
mental workload for the hover task compared to the action on contact task and
greater ocular fixation duration variability for the lower difficulty task.
Blink interval was greater for the pilot on-controls and saccadic extent was
greater for the pilot off-controls. Data suggest that blink interval and
saccadic extent are diagnostic of different aspects of visual workload, whereas
fixation duration variability is sensitive to mental workload.

%X Eye tracking results from a recent visual search experiment suggest 1)
people avoid searching in highly cluttered regions of displays, and 2) people
tend to start searching in regions with lower clutter and progress to regions
with higher clutter as needed. Subjects searched for a symbol randomly placed
in displays containing varying amounts of clutter, measured with the C3 clutter
metric (Lohrenz et al., 2009). Displays were categorized as having low, medium,
or high "global" clutter (average clutter for the display). Displays were
gridded into 100 cells, and a "local" C3 value was calculated for each cell. An
eye-tracker monitored search behavior. On average, with low and medium
global-clutter displays, subjects searched in areas with local clutter similar
to the displays' global clutter; with high global-clutter displays, subjects
searched in areas with significantly lower local clutter (relative to global
clutter). The average clutter of cells in which subjects searched plateaued at
C3=6.4 (on a scale from 0 to 12), suggesting a measurable limit to the amount
of clutter through which subjects are able (or willing) to search.

%X The objective of this study was to identify how visual input affects upright
balance when external loads are applied. Two independent variables were thus
investigated: visual input and loading conditions. Visual input was manipulated
by simply using eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. External loads were set
at 10kg and back-carried using a school backpack. During data collection, the
participants were instructed to stand upright on a force platform as still as
possible with feet parallel and together. The root measure square distance and
mean velocity of COP were used as dependent measures to quantify balance
control behaviors. Univariate ANOVA revealed that all the dependent measures
significantly increased in the eyes-closed condition versus eyes-open condition
when back-carrying external loads, indicating that deprived vision might lead
to less postural stability and increased fall risks. In addition, the effects
on balance caused by visual input were not affected by loading conditions.
Findings from this study demonstrated that visual input plays an important role
in the control of balance under different loading conditions. This information
could be useful, especially when developing interventions for the improvement
of balance in the condition where external loads are applied.

%X Objective: The aim of this research was to assess how changing the
orientation of the head to the trunk would impact the mobility and coordination
of multiple torso segments during a common postural transition. Background: The
dynamic relationship of the head to the trunk has a major impact on vestibular,
visual, and neck muscle stretch receptor sensory feedback. Integration of
sensory feedback is necessary to regulate postural control, which is necessary
for the performance of daily and occupational activities. During upright
stance, head extension induces postural sway (Vuillerme &amp; Rougier, 2005);
however, postural control within the torso may also be impacted. Methods:
Eleven male and thirteen female, healthy, young subjects performed the
sit-to-stand movement starting from standardized sitting conditions. Each
subject performed four sit-to-stand trials with each of three different head
orientations: extended, flexed, and neutral. 3-D kinematic data were analyzed
for six torso segments: head, cervical, upper-thoracic, mid-thoracic, lumbar,
and pelvis. Sagittal range of motion was calculated for torso joints composed
of adjacent segment pairs. Cross correlations and time lag to maximum cross
correlation were analyzed for all possible pairs of torso segments for
normalized sit-to-stand trials. Results: Moving from sitting to standing
elicited greater range of motion of most torso joints with the head extended
compared to with the head flexed or neutral. Cross correlations at zero lag and
maximum cross correlations for most torso segment pairs were lower with the
head extended compared to flexed or neutral. The lag to maximum cross
correlation was higher for all non-adjacent torso segments with the head
extended compared to flexed or neutral. Conclusion: Extending the head on the
trunk increased mobility within the trunk and decreased temporal coordination
between multiple torso segments. These findings suggest that changing the
relationship of the head to the trunk induces postural instability within the
torso in a healthy population during a postural transition. Application:
Increased mobility and reduced stability within the torso during postural
transitions could increase occupational risk for falls and injuries, such as
low back pain. Avoiding unnecessary head extension could decrease the
likelihood of postural instability and subsequent injury risk.

%X Given the increasing use of small screen devices to gather and provide
important information, a critical question is how learning and problem solving
performance is impacted by collecting data on a small device. This study
investigates how learning and application of information differs when it is
gathered using a small screen device versus a normal size desktop display.
Results indicate that while factual recall is equivalent across interfaces,
small screen devices appear to reduce how well participants apply these rules
towards correct solutions. Further, it appears that solution time is also
increased by using a small screen device. These results suggest that while
these small technologies are convenient for fact gathering and other simple
uses, there is a potential tradeoff when this learned information must be used
in complex and appropriate ways.

%X Laboratory testing was conducted to assess the slip resistance of men's
dress socks on typical household flooring surfaces under wet and dry
conditions. This study was conducted as a follow-up to a previous work on the
slip resistance of athletic socks. Both of these studies attempt to fill the
void of published data regarding the coefficient of friction between an indoor
walking surface and the foot of a pedestrian wearing socks (rather than shoes).
Eight different dress socks as well as a Neolite "shoe" were tested on wood and
textured vinyl floors under both wet and dry conditions.
   The results in this study indicated that in terms of slip resistance, it
makes little practical difference to a walker wearing loose-weave, non-nylon
dress socks whether the flooring is wet or dry. Socks with tighter weaves, such
as nylon socks, are significantly less slip-resistant on wet floors than under
dry conditions.

%X Many websites adhere to their own custom style guides and no longer follow
traditional usability standards such as the once ubiquitous, blue, underlined
text link. Users may miss important information by not knowing which elements
are clickable and which are not. The objective of this study was to determine
whether or not an option to highlight all the hyperlinks (links) on a website
would help users locate all of the page's available image and text-based links.
All participants were shown two different websites and asked to click on all
design elements that they thought were links. In the experimental condition,
participants had the option of using a keyboard shortcut key that, when
pressed, would highlight all the links on the website. In the control
condition, this option was not available. Significantly more participants in
the experimental condition found all of the links compared to the participants
without the highlight option. If the design of a website prevents developers
from implementing easily-discoverable links, developers should consider adding
an option that can highlight all of the links on a website.

%X Customer's satisfaction is a critical factor to a product's success and
identifying key affective response factors, which customers mainly perceive, is
critical to satisfy customers. This study aims to identify the key affective
response factor for the evaluation of passenger car interior material using
affective design methods. Related variables of satisfaction consisting of 10
affective response variables associated with look-and-feel and touch feel of a
surface material were systematically identified through literature survey,
customer reviews, and expert opinions. 30 users and 30 designers evaluated 41
different crash pad samples using a questionnaire survey with 7-point semantic
differential scale and 100-point magnitude estimation scale. Based on the
survey results, 'softness' was identified as the key affective response factor
of satisfaction for car crash pad. Also, the relationship between softness and
its related engineering variables was identified and modeled. It is expected
that the results could suggest the suitable combinations of material properties
for the maximum appeal and satisfaction of the user.

if the needs of people with disabilities were considered during the design
process. This paper describes an accessibility experience lab module which
introduces participants to both the barriers associated with disabilities and
the impact that simple design changes can have on those barriers. The core of
the lab is an experience session where participants are given functional
limitations along with tasks at paired stations so they can compare their
experiences on devices with inaccessible and accessible designs. For seven
years the experience lab has been a part of the curriculum for first-year
engineering students at the University of Wisconsin, and over 1700 students
have completed it. In the popular lab, the students are engaged and report
interest and insights into design for disabilities. Materials are available at

%X This project evaluated the effectiveness gained by redesigning a user
interface based on the knowledge structure of domain experts. Scenario-based
simulation enables realistic training in synthetic environments. As the
instructor remains essential to facilitating effective scenario-based training,
their user interface should be efficient. Previous research modeled knowledge
structures used to redesign a menu within a scenario generation interface. The
current research evaluated the redesigned menu based on the ascertained
knowledge structures. To evaluate the redesigned menu, participants were timed
as they selected target items in the original and redesigned menus. Results
indicated that experienced users selected items in the redesigned menu
significantly faster, and preferred the redesigned menu to the original. Thus,
this result demonstrates tangible benefits to organizing menus according to
expert knowledge, even when users are familiar with a menu structure. Using
methods that follow the general principles presented here will enable designers
to uncover expert knowledge and efficiently configure user interfaces, thereby
improving training effectiveness.

%X Among the most distractive in-vehicle interactions are audio and climate
controls. If these interactions were as easy and spontaneous as natural
language, driving could be much safer. Through this research it was found that
drivers preferred gestural language to voice language when the control was
simple and repetitive; subsequently, gestural interactions with secondary
in-vehicle tasks were investigated. Following the principle of "eyes on the
road and hands on the wheel", a steering wheel design with two touch pads on
the wheel to recognize gestures was conceived. The physical design of the
steering wheel incorporated good ergonomics and anthropometric data, while
gesture stereotypes assigned to a number of in-vehicle controls were determined
empirically by two experiments. The new steering wheel design does not have any
buttons, which may contribute to driver distraction, yet it incorporates 19
functions through natural thumb-gestures. This compares favorably with most
current steering wheel designs, which have more than 11 buttons and 13
functions on the average.

coupons to a mobile device based on shopping behaviors, another delivering
advertisements to a mobile device based on location and online activities, and
the third presenting TV advertisements based on viewing patterns. It was found
that targeted advertising was generally preferred to non-targeted advertising
but users wanted to control the type, quantity, frequency, range, and context
of the advertisements received. It was also important that advertisements be
based on personal data that users are willing to share and that targeting not
be intrusive or embarrassing. Targeted advertisements that offered discounts or
financial benefits were most preferred.

networking sites (Facebook and MySpace) in terms of their usability and design
heuristics. First, we discuss a brief history on social network websites that
have dominated the Internet in popularity and then declined over time due to
major setbacks or system design failures. Second, we discuss usability
heuristics and how they can be incorporated to social network websites to
improve their chances of success among users. Lastly, we present a study in
which we have used an adapted usability questionnaire based on these usability
heuristics. This usability questionnaire compares Facebook and MySpace by
rating them across eight dimensions such as simplicity, usefulness,
functionality, consistency, proficiency, satisfaction, behavior, and needs for
improvement. There was a significant difference between both social networks,
indicating that Facebook was rated the highest on usability over MySpace.

long a system should wait -- or time-out -- before providing some instruction
to a caller who is silent in response to a question. This study examined the
impact that various time-out values had on the responses to three different
question types. The results show that time-out values of 2 and 2.5 seconds
caused the most instances of system and caller talking at the same time. The
data also shows that these turn-taking issues have an effect on subsequent
interactions between system and caller.

%X Twenty-five participants performed a surgical training task on a large
format display created from one projector or by tiling the images from a 4-, or
9-projector array. Utilizing a large-format display consisting of tiled
projector images brings the potential benefits of increased display size with
the potential threats to performance of inherent visual artifacts. The effect
of these artifacts on performance and subjective workload was assessed. Results
indicate that while display size did not affect performance on the surgical
task, differences in mental workload were observed. Although a global measure
of workload indicated that the tiled displays were the least demanding to use,
participants reported deploying additional but highly specific cognitive
resources when using these same displays. Their resource shifts seemed to
involve adjustments to the perceived control gains created by enhanced size and
also degraded ability to compare target sizes in the larger display, possibly
due to the obscuring effect of tile edges.

%X When faced with a potential hazard, a pedestrian may need to change course,
stop, maintain speed or accelerate. Logically, this must involve both a delay
phase (to perceive a hazard and formulate a response) and an action phase
(e.g., to arrest forward momentum in a stopping response). Qualitatively, the
decision and response processes are similar to those an individual faces while
driving an automobile or riding a bicycle, but very little research has been
found on this subject for pedestrians. In the current study, jogging or walking
subjects were asked to stop quickly in response to an auditory signal, and data
were extracted from video recordings of the trials. The reaction time phase
observed in the study was similar to prepared reaction times in other settings.
The halting phase visibly began with a change in body angle, with rapid
deceleration following the subsequent heel strike. Both the time and the
distance to stop required from a jog or walk can be important for analysis of
vehicle-pedestrian collisions and other mishaps.

accident causal chain focused on human factors. In this paper, the cognitive
process model that can be used as a tool to identify unsafe acts, decisions or
conditions is discussed in detail, and 18 towing vessel collision accidents are
analyzed to identify related unsafe acts. Then the human factors analysis
technique which is based on the well-established human factors frameworks such
as SHELL model and Reason's Generic Error Modeling Systems (GEMS) framework is
used to identify underlying factors that cause those identified unsafe acts to
occur. Lastly, in order to derive the optimum safety barriers, the marine
accident causal chains are used.

therefore, this pilot study found it beneficial to evaluate the relationship
between Locus of Control (LOC), ethnicity, and technology and training adoption
decisions. The following research questions were proposed: 1) To what extent do
Hispanic and non-Hispanic workers differ in LOC? 2) In adoption decisions? 3)
How confidently can LOC be used to predict adoption decisions? 4) How
confidently can adoption decisions be used to predict LOC? The study utilized
secondary data collection. The quantitative data (103 participants; 79
non-Hispanic and 24 Hispanic) was analyzed with JMP 8. Results showed a
significant difference between the two groups in both LOC and adoptions
decisions. The qualitative data (29 participants; 13 non-Hispanic and 16
Hispanic) underwent content analysis using Atlas.ti. This study serves as a
starting point for other research interested in developing technology adoption
programs for this and possibly other populations.

their mental models of computers. The first group was interviewed in 1999, and
the second in 2009. In both data sets, children as young as 6 years of age
generated well developed analogies for computers. However, the 2009 data showed
that children are increasingly able to generate these analogies at a younger
age. Further, the types of analogies generated differed as a function of time,
with those interviewed in 1999 more likely to describe perceptual qualities of
computers (e.g., it is square), and those interviewed in 2009 relating
computers to both cell phones and entertainment devices. Children's knowledge

%X Various military and commercial entities, as well as the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), have conducted space-cabin
confinement studies. However, after an extensive literature search, only one
study was found using a simulated lunar rover (LUNEX II), under laboratory
conditions, with a crew of two for an 18-day lunar mission. Forty-three years
later, NASA human-factors engineers conducted a similar study using the Lunar
Electric Rover (LER) in a dynamic real-world lunar simulation at the Black
Point Lava Flow in Arizona. The objective of the study was to obtain
human-in-the-loop performance data on the vehicle's interior volume with
respect to human-system interfaces, crew accommodations, and habitation over a
14-day mission. Though part of a larger study including 212 overall operational
elements, this paper will discuss only the performance of fifty different daily
habitational elements within the confines of the vehicle carried out by two
male subjects. Objective timing data and subjective questionnaire data were
collected. Results indicate, much like the LUNEX II study, the LER field study
suggest that a crew of two was able to maintain a satisfactory performance of
tasks throughout the 14-day field trail within a relative small vehicle volume.

%X Advances in forensic technologies and procedures seek to produce better and
more efficient policing for safer societies. Little is understood, however,
about how effectively the human forensic professional employs such
technologies, or the cognitive and perceptual processes of judgment and
decision making the forensic professional engages in during the course of
evidence evaluation. For this, experimenters need materials that approximate
the realism of crime scene evidence, while ensuring the ground truth about the
source of this information. These two goals are often incompatible. We discuss
the development of an open-source biometric repository to address the issue of
ground truth. This repository contains a range of crime related materials such
as fingerprints and palm-prints, shoe-prints, faces, handwriting, voices, and
irises. Our goal is to provide a large, open-source repository of forensic
information, where certainty of the source in built into the system, to help
advance research on identification by humans and technology.

%X This paper presents a model for understanding the evolution of worker
strategies in rural northern Mozambique, an industrially developing
agricultural region. We reviewed administrative data on grower productivity
from an integrated poultry operation, visited three grower chicken houses, and
followed-up with informal discussions with the integrator, examining tasks and
strategies related to productivity. Defining strategy as a mode of behavior
that demands a resource profile and generates a performance profile that
depends on the environment, we discuss examples of strategies and their
adaptation over three time horizons. These time horizons are exemplified in the
poultry growing domain as the critical brooding period following birth, the
weekly routine within a growing cycle, and the span of months comprised of
several growing cycles. Responding to observed flock characteristics, growers
used behavioral indicators of health to adjust temperature; used heuristics to
adjust feed based on measured weight; and constructed items to reduce exposure
of the flock to disease. Growers adapted strategies according to the work
context. Heat control strategies, for example, varied seasonally. Viewing
strategy change in the context of a self-regulation model in which growers
actively control their work environment reveals interactions over time
horizons, which range from minutes to months, and link micro and
macro-cognition. The self-regulation model also suggests that strategy change
creates experiences that enrich the grower's conceptual models and improve
skills, which in turn enable new strategies. Investigating growers' control
strategies can reveal interactions between micro and macro-cognition that
influence strategy development and change.

%X Most approaches to controlling autonomous systems require extensive
pre-mission preparation, intensive effort by the human operator, or have strong
limitations on the range of possible missions that can be accomplished. In this
paper we describe an approach called Cognitive Patterns that promises to
alleviate these challenges by replicating three key processes of human
cognition -- pattern generation, perception/action, and adaptation -- and
instantiating them in a new architecture which can then be embedded into an
autonomous system. An early version of this approach connected high-level
knowledge representations in an ontology with a robot's sensing and acting
abilities. The advantages of this approach were then demonstrated in a
simulation environment. A more refined version, based on lessons learned and
called Cognitive Patterns Knowledge Generation, can deal with anomalies,
unexpected events, and uncertainties, and is also described in terms of its
components, their interactions, and benefits.

training by supplying 2D images of 3D models at different views. Additionally,
the relationship between the spatial construct of closure speed and target
identification was examined. Participants were administered three tests of
closure speed, and then trained on armored vehicle recognition with 2D images
of 3D models at more angles than typically given with line drawings supplied to
soldiers. Results did not show a significant difference between the training
conditions on a tank recognition task. Examining the relationship between
performance on closure speed tests and tank recognition performance scores
showed mixed results. Implications of this research may include considerations
for selection and training of future unmanned vehicle operators.

could help the human operator control a team of robots, for enhancing the
overall human-robot teaming performance. We compared the operators' target
detection performance in the 4-robot and 8-robot conditions. The results showed
that the participants detected significantly fewer targets with 8 robots vs. 4
robots. Although there were no significance differences between the RoboLeader
and Baseline (no RoboLeader) conditions for target detection, the Roboleader
group reduced their mission completion times by approximately 13% compared to
Baseline. Those participants with higher spatial ability detected more targets
than did those with lower spatial ability. Participants experienced
significantly higher workload with 8 robots compared to the 4-robot condition,
and those with better attentional control reported lower workload than did
those with poorer attentional control.

(with various terrains) and live robot teleoperation. Results showed that,
overall, participants completed their tasks significantly faster when they used
an SD in 3D mode compared to the baseline 2D/monoscopic mode. They also
navigated more accurately with SDs in 3D mode. The results also showed that the
system with active 3D shutter glasses appeared to be more effective in
supporting faster responses and task completion times than the system using
passive polarized 3D glasses. Participants' self-assessed "simulator sickness"
and workload after interacting with the two SD systems did not differ
significantly between displays or between the 3D vs. 2D modes of operation.

effort to understand the impact of human-robot interaction (HRI) and teaming
for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) in future

human-robotic principles derived from these programs. The principles cover both
problems and solutions evaluated over the more than six years of
experimentation. We discuss the implications of Soldier teaming, survivability,
multitasking, automation and the importance of individual differences for HRI.
Mitigation strategies related to individual differences and training regimens

%X Previous studies have begun exploring the possibility that "adaptable"
automation, in which tasks are delegated to intelligent automation by the user,
can preserve the benefits of automation while minimizing its costs. One
approach to adaptable automation is the Playbook interface, which has been used
in previous research and has shown performance enhancements as compared to
other automation approaches. However, additional investigations are warranted
to evaluate both benefits and potential costs of adaptable automation. The
present study incorporated a delegation interface into a new display and
simulation system, the multiple unmanned aerial vehicle simulator (MUSIM), to
allow for flexible control over three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at three
levels of delegation abstraction. Task load was manipulated by increasing the
frequency of primary and secondary task events. Additionally, participants
experienced an unanticipated event that was not a good fit for the higher
levels of delegation abstraction. Treatment of this poor "automation fit"
event, termed a "Non-Optimal Play Environment" event (NOPE event), required the
use of manual control. Results showed advantages when access to the highest
levels of delegation abstraction was provided and as long as operators also had
the flexibility to revert to manual control. Performance was better across the
two task load conditions and reaction time to respond to the NOPE event was
fastest in this condition. The results extend previous findings showing
benefits of flexible delegation of tasks to automation using the Playbook
interface and suggest that Playbook remains robust even in the face of poor
"automation-fit" events.

%X Automation use can be analyzed by looking at compliance rates (agreeing with
automated alerts) and reliance rates (agreeing with automated nonalerts). The
authors investigated how compliance and reliance rates in a target detection
task depend on the perceived difficulty and importance of the trials and on the
feedback given after each trial. Results show that focusing on trial importance
significantly increased participants' compliance rates while reliance rates
remained stable. When no feedback was presented, participants were more likely
to comply with the automated aid in trials they perceived as difficult, but
this trend reversed when importance was introduced and correlated with
difficulty.

%X Alarms are implemented into automated systems to focus human operators'
attention on potentially problematic conditions. Some automated alarm systems
are false-alarm prone (FP) and others are missprone (MP) due to the nature of
their setting and designer-imposed parameters. Binary alarm technology (BAT)
and likelihood alarm technology (LAT) represent two methods of alarm
implementation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differential
effects of LAT combined with FP vs. MP automation on human decision-making
accuracy and bias. This study utilized a 2 x 2 between-groups experimental
design. Alarm technology (BAT vs. LAT) and type of automation (FP vs. MP) were
systematically manipulated as independent variables. Decision-making accuracy
and bias served as dependent measures. This experiment provides evidence for
the advantages of LAT used in FP automation over alternative alarm
configurations. Results supported hypotheses regarding a predicted interaction
of alarm technology and type of automation for both decision-making accuracy
and bias. FP automation with LAT elicits urgency-based responses that reduce
bias toward false alarms and significantly increase overall decision making
accuracy. This alarm configuration may best be applied to similar diagnostic
tasks performed with unmanned aerial vehicle displays and aircraft flight
decks.

%X We investigated the effects of false-alarm prone (FP) vs. miss-prone (MP)
automation and the effects of likelihood alarm technology (LAT) on trust,
reliance, and compliance. One hundred participants completed simulated unmanned
aerial vehicle missions consisting of two primary tasks and a secondary
weapon-deployment task aided by automation. It was predicted that MP automation
would increase trust, LAT would increase trust, FP automation would increase
reliance, and MP automation would increase compliance whereas LAT would
decrease compliance when used with a FP system. Results indicated that trust
was higher with the FP system, reliance was higher with the FP system, and
compliance was higher with the MP system. This paper further informs the
relationships among trust, reliance, and compliance, and it adds to our
understanding of operator behavior in miss-prone tasks. Practical applications
of this research include improving automation design and choosing the
appropriate type of automation to implement for specific situations.

%X Since 1999, aircraft maintenance personnel in the European Union (EU) have
been required to take human factors training. This training is not required in
the United States (US). The relative rates of maintenance-related incidents in
the US and the EU were compared prior to and after the implementation of
mandatory human factors training in the EU. Prior to 1999, the rates of
maintenance-related error for the EU and the US were not statistically
different. In the years following the implementation of mandatory human factors
training in the EU, the difference in rates for the US and the EU became
statistically significant. Our results suggest that human factors training may
be valuable in reducing maintenance-related error in aviation.

%X In the planned NextGen aviation operations, it will be critical to ensure
shared situational understanding and cooperative problem solving between
aircrews and ATC (Air Traffic Controllers). A first step in predicting how
future changes will impact flight crews and ATC is to examine the present
system and to pinpoint problematic areas that may be ameliorated or exacerbated
by advanced automation and heavier traffic density. Method: We coded ASRS
(Aviation Safety Reporting System) reports identified as having communication
conflicts between pilots and ATC. Results: Results describe types of conflict,
operational context, phase of flight, operator states, and situations conducive
to communication conflicts, risk perception differences and inappropriate
resolution strategies. Limitations -- Characteristics of the ASRS database
guarantee that it is a rich source of data, but also impose inherent
limitations with respect to generalization. Implications: This research will
enable us to better predict NextGen aircrew/ATC communication breakdowns and
conflicts resulting from specific situations and/or operator states.

%X Although previous studies have assessed the allocation of central and
peripheral vision in functional field of view (FFOV) tasks, few studies have
directly assessed changes in the FFOV within a driving environment. By
modifying a typical FFOV task paradigm with central and peripheral target tasks
occurring in a low-fidelity driving simulation, a method of assessing the
allocation of peripheral vision resources was developed. Two experiments were
conducted to: 1) validate the FFOV task in a driving simulation environment, 2)
assess peripheral attention distribution due to the simulation background, and
3) assess peripheral attention distribution due to a basic vehicle steering
task. In Experiment 1, the central and peripheral task performance of 17
college undergraduates (8 males, 9 females) was compared when provided a blank
white screen versus the driving simulation background (i.e., driver's vehicle
moving on a winding road towards a distant horizon). In Experiment 2, the
central and peripheral task performance of 27 college undergraduates (19 male,
8 female) was assessed when provided the same driving simulation background as
in Experiment 1, but with the additional task of controlling the vehicle's lane
position. Both experiments used a central, two-choice object recognition task
that varied in object display speed (160, 260 ms) with a concurrent peripheral
target detection task that varied in eccentricity (10, 20, 30&deg; visual
angle) and radial position (4 cardinal, 4 oblique). Results from both
experiments indicated a successful replication of a FFOV task with poorer
peripheral task performance as peripheral targets increased in display speed
and eccentricity. Analysis of peripheral target localization accuracy
performance suggested a lower visual field dominance and a differentiated
pattern of peripheral attention allocation for the driving environment and when
the participants were performing the steering task.

%X The objective of the current study was to measure the effect of frustration
on drivers' performance and scanning efficiency in a driving simulator. We
hypothesized that unsafe driving would be elicited by a combination of
manipulating frustrating events in the external driving environment while
inducing a sense of time pressure within the driver. Two age groups of drivers
drove through several frustrating situations on the road while trying to reach
a destination within a limited time. The induced frustration decreased drivers'
awareness of potential distractions, mental state, and potential danger in
driving environment. When compared to younger drivers, older drivers had a more
efficient scanning routine and safer vehicle control. This study speaks to the
need for emotionally engaging simulated driving scenarios to produce more
realistic driver performance.

%X If novel displays in the vehicle are not easily understood, they may
increase driver distraction and result in higher crash risk. In this way,
improving the usability of in-vehicle displays may decrease crash risk. However
when there are a large number of interface design options, it is difficult to
quickly determine which will be the most beneficial. The goal of this
evaluation was to identify fuel economy display components and information
types that would have the highest potential to improve accuracy and acceptance.
Participants were more accurate at identifying fuel economy level when viewing
information presented on horizontal bar display components with reference
points. Subjective scores suggested that a balance of instantaneous and
long-term information types was associated with greater interface acceptance.
Results of this rapid assessment show the utility of supplementing objective
accuracy measures with subjective acceptance metrics when considering multiple
user interface designs.

%X This study was designed to empirically examine the effects of text-messaging
on driver distraction. Thirty participants were required to perform a driving
simulation task while text-messaging using a cellular phone device. Driving
errors as measured by lane deviations, crossing the median, crashes, etc., were
recorded and analyzed as a function of the distracter. Physiological measures
(EEG) were also recorded during the driving phases to quantitatively measure
the participant's level of cortical arousal. It was hypothesized that
text-messaging would affect driving ability and the level of cortical arousal.
The results indicated higher levels of arousal and a prevalence of the theta
frequency (4-7 Hz), which is associated with distractibility as a result of
text-messaging activity. In addition, participants showed an increased number
of driving errors as a function of text-messaging distractibility. These
results have major implications for in-vehicle systems design, traffic safety,
and driver attention and workload.

function of fixed-base versus rotating base platforms. Eight males and eight
females drove through two routes in a driving simulator. One route was
presented in fixed-base mode and another was presented in motion-base with a .5
to 1 ratio of motion (physical world to virtual world). Routes and fixed versus
motion mode were presented in counterbalanced order. Measures of simulator
sickness on the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (Kennedy et al., 1993) were
obtained after each route. As predicted, males reported lower levels of
simulator sickness than females. A non-significant trend for this gender effect
to be diminished in the rotating versus stationary condition was observed.
Results warrant additional investigation into the potential for motion-based
platforms to reduce the incidence and severity of simulator sickness in
populations at greater risk of experiencing these negative consequences (i.e.,
females and older adults).

%X School is a person's first workplace and, from the age of six, children
experience activities such as lifting, pulling and carrying a load (typically
in the form of a backpack) which often represents an important percentage of
their body weight. Among the possible consequences originated by back overload
we have balance impairment and altered plantar pressure distribution, which
however have been scarcely explored in children. On the basis of these
considerations, this study intends to assess modifications in sway parameters,
foot-ground contact area and pressure distribution introduced by backpack
carriage in Italian primary school children. Two 30-second trials (with and
without backpack) were performed directly at a school on a regular school day
to collect data on sway area, centre of pressure path length, maximum
displacement range in Antero-Posterior and Medio-Lateral directions,
foot-ground contact area and pressure distribution. The results show a
significant load-induced increase in all sway parameters and the existence of a
linear relationship between sway area and backpack weight. Contact area also
varies linearly with load and peak pressure values are significantly altered by
the presence of a backpack in midfoot and forefoot, with increases up to 30%.
These findings, together with the fact that about half the children carry a
load exceeding 15% of their body weight, suggest that concern about severe
postural alterations associated with carriage of overweight backpacks, remains
justified.

%X Systematic approaches for presenting medical information to seniors have not
been widely explored and published. Prior to incorporating a mobility and
physical functioning measure into clinical practice, meaningful and
understandable reporting formats were needed for patients. It was important for
seniors with varying educational and cognitive levels to understand the
information. Testing was conducted in three phases with 28 participants in the
final phase. Volunteers included seniors with a broad range of physical
functioning. Focus groups and interviews evaluated prototype reports using
several presentation styles, graph orientations, and levels of
detail/abstraction. Ease of incorporation into both paper and electronic
medical records was also considered. The final product reflects the preferences
of the older participants as well as design constraints and consideration for
how the reports would be presented in paper and electronic format. To maximize
health literacy, all medical reports would benefit from user-centered design.

%X PROBLEM STATEMENT: For Intensive Care Units (ICUs) patients frequent noise,
confusing patient monitors and loud alarms decrease the quality of stay, and
may event extend its length. Nurses frequently enter the patient's room to
check the patient monitor to become aware of changes, potentially disturbing
patients and family. Ambient displays can communicate changes by subtly
changing the environment, and have been shown to be unobtrusive and not
disturbing to its users. An ambient display, visible from the doorway, would
allow nurses to be aware of patient changes before alarms occur.
   OBJECTIVE: Our hypothesis is that color coded ambient displays using the
standard vital sign colors are intuitively understood by clinicians and can
communicate deviations in patient state.
   METHODS: We designed an ambient display, which communicates changes in
patient's vital signs by changing its background color. A heuristic evaluation
was performed, followed by an intrusive questionnaire of nurse without prior
explanation of the color-coding.
   RESULTS: The results of the heuristic evaluation indicated that simultaneous
changes could not be displayed. In the intrusive evaluation nurses correctly
identified patient changes 73% of the time. Additionally, nurses correctly
recalled 92% of vital sign colors used on their current patient monitor.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings confirm that color coded ambient displays using the
standard vital sign colors are intuitively understood by clinicians and can
communicate deviations in patient state. Future research needs to evaluate
ambient displays in real ICU environments and identify nurses, patients' and
families' reactions to such displays.

%X Naturalistic observations of two fifth-year surgical trainees in the OR
revealed that they struggled with specific tasks during several seemingly
straightforward laparoscopic surgical procedures. Retrospective think-aloud
reports of the trainees and their attending surgeons on those tasks in video
clips and NASATLX ratings further shed lights on trainees' specific challenges.
Results showed that trainees' inadequate cognitive skills rather than poor
technical skills could be their greatest hindrance in performing those tasks.
Specifically, the trainees seemed to focus their attention on immediate urgent
tasks and failed to plan strategically for action sequences or manipulations.
NASA-TLX results further showed that trainees and attending surgeons differed
in their perceptions of effort, performance, and frustration in performing
those isolated tasks. These preliminary data suggested that a gap exists
between trainees and the more experienced surgeons on their attention
allocation strategies, which may indicate the need to emphasize cognitive
skills training such as multitasking during the practice of surgical skills
outside the OR.

%X Home-based patient monitors have limited access for field nurses when they
are away from their desktop computers and central monitoring station software.
The major consequences of this are delayed responses to patient problems,
possibly leading to less effective treatment. Further, nurses' laptops lack
mobility and versatility, which often makes it difficult for them to quickly
access patient information during a variety of tasks. Using nurse demographic
information, requirements gathering, and observations from 15 nurses, a design
concept for both a longer-term nurse hand held device with a touch screen
interface, as well as a simple cellular telephone application that can receive
SMS messages on patient problems from the central monitoring station were
proposed. It was anticipated that after successful user testing with nurses on
the simpler cellular telephone application, that a more capable application
could be developed for their cellular telephones with the ability to send and
receive information from the central monitoring station.

%X Technological innovations are at the forefront of advances in minimally
invasive surgery. Reduced visual and haptic cues, along with frame-of-reference
problems with location and scale can cause surgeons to become disoriented.
While most laparoscopic surgeries are performed via the use of a limited,
single-scope, two-dimensional (2-D) view presented on a monitor in the
operating room, there is demand for the availability of three-dimensional
(3-D), global views. We compared workload, task-completion time, and the
ability to recreate spatial mental representations between study participants
who used the current scopeview display and those who used a dual-view display
that included both the scope view and a computationally generated global view.
We found no statistically reliable improvements for the dual-view display over
the single-view display for any of our criterion measures, although trends were
toward a dual-view advantage for workload in all tasks and accuracy in the
reconstruction task, despite participants' claims that they did not utilize the
global view during the experiment. Future research is needed to better
understand the information available on global views that can enhance
performance during surgical tasks and participants' decisions regarding when to
use different views to support their performance.

%X Objective: To systematically describe communication between tele-ICU
(Intensive Care Unit) nurses and bedside nurses in multiple ICUs, the strengths
and weaknesses of communication in the tele-ICU and possible solutions for
improving communication. Background: Nurses in tele-ICUs function in virtual
teams whose configuration and membership is constantly and rapidly changing.
This research examines communication and technological support for
communication in the multiple virtual teams formed by tele-ICU nurses and ICU
nurses. Methods: A case study research approach using mixed data collection
methods. One tele-ICU that monitors 16 ICUs in 12 hospitals across the US
participated in this study. Results: Tele-ICU nurses spend 26% of their time in
communication-related activities. Fifteen percent of tele-ICU nurses surveyed
reported getting incorrect information from ICU nurses and 40% reported that
they are not informed in a timely manner about a change in patient status.
Frequency of communication between tele-ICU and ICU nurses depends on several
factors such as time of day and intensivist coverage in the ICU. Tele-ICU
nurses develop and employ unique strategies for communicating with ICU nurses.
Conclusion: Tele-ICU nurses use many approaches and techniques when
communicating with multiple ICUs. Additional research needs to generalize these
findings.

%X Occupational injury is a prevalent problem in long-term care. However, there
is a noticeable lack of research related to workers providing Personal
Assistance Services (PAS) -- the personal care and housekeeping tasks that
enable elderly and other disabled adults to live in community settings. We
conducted a statewide computer assisted telephone survey of PAS providers
(n=855) from California's In Home Supportive Services program to describe the
homecare environment and its impact on the worker's health and ability to
provide care. PAS providers reported on a variety of household and personal
care tasks, including client lifting and transfers, as well as on barriers to
care delivery. A total of 262 providers (31%) reported musculoskeletal symptoms
or acute injuries causing at least moderate pain (defined as 'prominent'
problems) that had occurred in the prior 12 months; 25% of that group (n=65)
reported 12 or more episodes in the previous 12 months of probable work-related
musculoskeletal symptoms. Because of these prominent problems, 26 workers
missed work, 54 changed their work duties, and 12 had to drop work hours or
clients.

%X Although widely practiced in the medical field, the current "see one, do
one, teach one" surgical training model introduces a wide variety of variation
between surgeons. Without a standardized procedure, causes of medical errors
and relationships between surgery and outcomes are hard to identify. The
proposed study will utilize work method techniques to develop a hierarchical
taxonomy of essential tasks which will help identify and measure the effects of
surgical techniques on patient outcomes. Video data of microvascular
anastomosis was recorded and task decomposition analysis was completed for two
full procedures. The resulting analysis was used to create a hierarchical
taxonomy describing the surgery in the varying granularity levels of job, task,
subtask, element, and motion. The taxonomy can be effective in identifying
technique and tools variations at different levels. Future work includes
linking the surgery variables to outcome measures and creating protocols for
training and evaluating students in surgery.

%X Although a nurse's job is inundated with prospective memory (PM) demands,
and studies show that PM failures are a key component of adverse medical
events, only one study has examined prospective memory in nursing (Grundgeiger,
Sanderson, MacDougall, &amp; Venkatesh, 2009). The purpose of the current study
was to complement existing research with self-reports from 25 nurses on the PM
tasks they must remember and those they forget. Results revealed that nurses
most frequently perform episodic tasks, and these tasks can be further
classified to better explain when nursing PM demands arise and what the demands
consist of. A more specific categorization of nursing PM tasks enables
researchers to focus on specific design solutions. We provide examples of such
re-design recommendations intended to alleviate PM demands.

%X Omnipresent in everyday multitasking environments task interruptions are
usually detrimental to individual performance. Here, we examined whether
teaming up renders an individual less vulnerable to interruptions in complex
and dynamic situations. We employed a microworld to simulate command and
control in a crisis management situation and to examine the relative impact of
interruptions on operators working in a functional dyad versus operators
working alone. While task interruption was detrimental to efficacy in
supervisory control of both single and team interrupted operators, the latter
were less vulnerable than the former. However, teaming up did not translate
into faster resumption time, a consequence of the overhead attributable to
coordination and communication requirements of collaborative work. These
findings suggest that in complex and dynamic environments working in a small
team confers more resistance to task interruption than working alone and speed
of interruption recovery is no guarantee of quality of recovery.

%X Crisis management (CM) is a facet of command and control (C2) characterized
by complexity and uncertainty, in addition to high time pressure. In order to
meet the challenges of this kind of unpredictable crisis situations, teams must
be able to adapt and coordinate in an effective way. The functional structure
(i.e., each team member is allocated a unique functional role) is the most
common in CM, but it is not necessarily the most efficient one. Structures that
encourage independence and flexibility, like the cross-functional structure
(i.e., team functions are shared across all team members), could promote much
better performance in this kind of situations. We compared these two
structures, functional and cross-functional, in a dynamic situation of CM.
C3Fire, a forest firefighting simulation, was used to compare team structure on
the basis of performance (process gain), communication, coordination and
adaptability. Cross-functional team structures presented a better process gain,
a more efficient coordination, and less communication. Surprisingly, no
differences were seen regarding adaptability.

participants were randomly assigned to the role of unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) operator, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) operator, and intelligence
officer (leader) to create a total of 22 teams, and spatial ability was
assessed with Part 5 of the Guilford-Zimmerman Aptitude Survey. Findings
indicated that spatial ability of the UAV operator and UGV operator improved
reconnaissance, and while spatial ability of the UAV operator improved
reacquisition of objectives after reconnaissance, spatial ability of the
intelligence officer hindered team performance on this second task. A rationale
for these results was developed with findings from the Multiple Resource

ability and visual perception in complex teams.

%X The current study explored the role of collaboration in team performance
using a computer-based simulation of a supply chain called the Beer Game
developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In SCM
simulations, as in real life, a 'bullwhip' effect leads to a drop in
profitability of the supply chain. The inclusion of Human Factors knowledge
within the domain of SCM provides a rich source of understanding of
bullwhip-related phenomena experienced by managers. In this paper we describe a
technique called 'Cognitive Network Tracing' which is used to examine the
processes by which supply chain members make decisions and engage in
communication in such scenarios. We examined the influence of different levels
of Situation Awareness (SA) information given to supply chain members, and the
influence of individual- or team-focused instructions, on a variety of measures
of performance, communication, and SA. Results showed that team-focused groups
of participants achieved better supply chain management performance than
individual-focused groups of participants, but only when they were given
information about current demand level in the supply chain. It is concluded
that "Management Flight Simulators", such as the Beer Game, have validity as
tools to examine team collaboration and performance in management scenarios.

%X The objective of this study was to uncover the cognitive underpinnings of
Improvised Explosive Device (IED) emplacement detection expertise possessed by
United States Army Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Mission Payload Operators
(MPOs) who have a proven history of success at this task. Specific issues of
interest include identifying strategies used to detect IED emplacement threats,
as well as identifying indicators and cues associated with IED emplacement to
provide the basis for future training. We reviewed existing training programs
and interviewed MPOs with varying levels of in-theater experience. Initial data
gathered was verified by presenting video recordings from UAS sensors depicting
possible IED emplacement activity to an additional group of experienced MPOs.
These videos were used to elicit cues and strategies used to identify potential
threats. Results of this study highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) employed by experienced MPOs. The results also emphasize the need for
training on IED emplacement detection and support the presentation of feedback
from tactical ground units to reinforce effective search strategies. Finally,
there is support for the development of realistic IED emplacement indicators in
the visual models, supporting simulation for use as an unclassified training
tool for initial and reinforcement training.

%X This study investigated the impact of feedback interventions on a perceptual
aviation training task. Previous research on feedback suggests that knowledge
of results and conceptual feedback can facilitate learning in certain contexts.
Using an aviation discrimination training module, we sought to examine this
influence in perceptual training and collected data from 52 volunteer
participants. Initial results suggested that there was no noticeable difference
between feedback and non-feedback conditions with respect to post-training
performance. However, an interesting finding stemming from the average reaction
times during training was that knowledge of results may alter response
strategies in training: Whereas the no-feedback and conceptual feedback groups
required significantly more time for their responses during training than
either in the pre- or post-test (suggesting that they needed time to "think
through" their responses in the training), the knowledge-of-results group was
not only faster than the other groups in training, but its respondents also did
not show the increase in response times during training that was so
characteristic of the other two conditions. We concluded that this suggested
that knowledge of results allowed participants to respond quickly and without
the need of time to "think through" their responses. Based on the outcome of
this study, we discuss the training implications for training perceptual tasks
that rely on accurate and timely action.

difficulty in terms of clutter quantity. Results suggest that holistic training
has benefits for performance during testing when threats are partially

that training type had a significant impact on performance, such that dyads
receiving cross-training had higher levels of performance than those receiving
team coordination training. However, this effect did not vary across

%X This study examined threat identification within a perceptual discrimination
training paradigm for an x-ray baggage screening task. It explored how
manipulations of item overlap (critical contour overlap, noncritical contour
overlap, and no overlap) altered detection of actual threat items. The results
suggest that threat detection by participants in the overlap groups was
superior, but that this may have been due to changes to a more liberal response
criterion. Further, participants trained without overlap were superior at
determining that no threat was present. The data suggest that this shift in
criterion may be due to a varying degree of understanding of what constitutes
the critical components of a threat item. The discussion centers on how to
develop training interventions which addresses this criterion shift while
maintaining higher levels of detection.

there are numerous options for SA measurement, none are currently suitable in
dynamic, uncontrolled environments. The current research explored the
relationship between direct measures of SA and eye tracking measures as a first
step in the development of an unobtrusive measure to be used in environments
not suited for existing SA measurement methods. Results showed that the more
individuals fixated on an important aircraft in an air traffic control task,
the higher their SA for that aircraft. The study also provided evidence that
the way operators allocate attention (i.e., distributed widely or narrowly)
affects their SA, as well as their task performance. The results indicate that
eye tracking may be a viable option for measuring SA in environments not
conducive to current direct SA measurement techniques.

%X A study was conducted to investigate the switching cost of changing the
location of a visual alert while participants performed a high intensity,
multi-display task. Based on the proposition that the spatial window of
attention can be extended to include relevant, though non-task-related
information, it was hypothesized that response times to the alert would
increase immediately following a change in location and then recover.
Generally, results showed that this was not the case, but instead response time
increased several minutes after the change in location and then recovered.
Further investigation revealed that age and expertise (defined as experience
with tasks involving multiple displays or video gaming), were strong moderators
of the effect of slowed response after switching. Less experienced adults
showed an immediate and significant cost that was not shown at all, or was
shown later, by more experienced adults. Older adults showed a switching cost
that was absent in younger adults. The results suggest that experience with a
specific task, or more general video game experience, can guard against the
cost associated with moving an alert to a new, relatively untrained location.

%X In many modern environments noise is a pervasive and influential source of
stress. Whether it is the acute result of impulse noise or the chronic effects
of prolonged exposure to active machinery the challenge of noise faces many who
must accomplish vital performance duties. While noise can have diffuse effects
which are shared in common with any chronic form of stress, its influence can
also vary as a function of the characteristics of the task and of the noise
itself. Here, we provide a quantitative evaluation of those influences so that
their most harmful effects can be mitigated, their most beneficial effects
exploited and any residual effects incorporated and synthesized into selection,
training and design strategies to facilitate human performance.

%X During simulated low-altitude flight, participants' control of speed is
based on the optical flow rate projected by the ground, even when changes in
altitude make this information unreliable and other sources of speed
information, such as the flow rate of a cloud layer above the flight path,
could help to provide more valid information (Wotring, 2008). This study
examined whether this ground bias in perceiving speed could be overcome by
using a secondary visual search task to manipulate the attentional focus away
from the ground. A task requiring participants to visually scan for
potentially-colliding planes either above or below the horizon was coupled with
a speed maintenance task similar to the task used by Bennett, Flach, McEwen
&amp; Russell (2006) and Wotring, Dyre, &amp; Behre (2008). We found that
altitude disturbances induced inappropriate speed control in a similar manner
independent of whether the secondary task required the attentional focus to be
directed above or below the horizon. These results suggest that ground bias in
speed control is robust even when attention is directed above the horizon by a
secondary visual task.

%X Objective: The purpose of the current study was to analyze the interaction
between operator strategy and consistency over time. Background: Sub-optimal
human-automation performance is a phenomenon whereby combining human operators
with diagnostic aids results in performance that is less than desirable. Rice,
Trafimow and Hunt (in press) used Potential Performance Theory (PPT) to show
that strategies account for little of the variance in sub-optimal performance,
and that most of the decrements are due to operators inconsistently using these
strategies. The current study looks at these issues across multiple sessions.
Method: 20 participants spent four sessions searching for enemy helicopters in
aerial images of Baghdad; the task was augmented by a 70% reliable diagnostic
aid that provided recommendations during each trial. Results: Consistency
accounted for improvement in observed scores early on, despite no gains to
strategy, while improvements in strategy accounted for increased observed
performance in the later sessions, despite no gains to consistency. Individual
data were also analyzed separately, showing various reasons for improvement
across time. Conclusion: Both consistency and strategy play important roles in
observed performance during human-automation interaction. Application: This
study points to a topic that designers and users of automated systems should
carefully consider.

%X Effective teamwork is an important component in the control of multiple
unmanned vehicles (UVs). Personality traits of individual team members may be a
factor influencing overall team performance and individual levels of perceived
workload and stress. In this study, a multiple UV environment was simulated by
use of the RoboFlag game. Participants played the RoboFlag game individually or
in two-person teams and were presented with this sequence of task-phases:
RoboFlag alone, RoboFlag with a secondary task, RoboFlag alone. It was
predicted that the RoboFlag performance would relate to 'Big Five' personality
traits. It was also expected that Neuroticism would relate to higher workload
and stress, especially in more demanding task conditions. The results suggested
that the influence of personality is generally limited, but may sometimes be
important. Specifically, high Neuroticism individuals showed higher workload
and stress in a team player condition, which may impose social as well as task
demands.

%X Human factors research is often focused on the mental workload that is
required to perform a task or set of tasks with the goal of reducing workload
to make systems easier to manage. The Improved Performance Research Integration
Tool (IMPRINT) includes an algorithm to predict mental workload. The algorithm
was developed using subject matter expert ratings of workload tasks. We aimed
to enhance this capability by developing algorithms using data from four new
studies investigating change in performance as demands on mental resources
increase. The results indicate three task types of similar difficulty and one
task type of much greater difficulty. We then map these to our hypothesized
workload function. Finally, we propose a way forward in modeling performance as
a function of workload in IMPRINT.

%X A study of 105 university students examined whether the length or type of
Auditory Progress Bar (APB) used in a telephone on-hold situation had an impact
on users' subjective mental workload. Auditory cues can be designed into APBs
to provide information to the caller regarding the approximate duration of the
hold time. Previous research has found that the majority of callers tend to
multi-task during on-hold situations. Thus the design of any stimuli presented
while the caller is on hold should take this into account. To do this, it is
important for designers to understand how APB design might impact callers'
mental workloads. In the current study, participants experienced one of three
APB design types (cello, sine, electronic) in four different lengths (30, 60,
120 and 240 seconds). An on-hold call center experience was simulated using a
computer-generated interactive voice response system and workload data was
collected using the NASA-TLX. The results of this study indicate that the type
of APB does not appear to have a significant impact on callers' assessment of
mental workload, but that the duration of the stimuli does.

rate (event rate) and information structure (display uncertainty) affect
performance on a cognitively demanding signal detection task. Performance as
well as perceived workload and stress were measured. Results supported a
performance-workload association rather than performance insensitivity, but the
pattern of decline in adaptation to task-induced stress generally conformed to
the maximal adaptability model: At lower levels of demand the change in
accuracy and workload was smaller, but at higher demand these changes increased
in magnitude.

%X Prospective workload measures are used to assess individuals' expectations
about tasks they are facing, how difficult they think the tasks will be and how
well they expect to perform. In this study, 43 participants used the NASA-TLX
subjective workload scale to predict the difficulty of surgical training tasks.
The goal of the study was to determine the accuracy of their predictions and
whether the act of assessing tasks before performing them affected their
judgments post-performance. Regarding initial performance, results showed that
participants formed prospective judgments that were consistent with their
retrospective judgments, but they underestimated physical demands. After only
minimal practice, however, their retrospective judgments deviated from both the
experimental group's initial predictions and the control group's initial
retrospective assessments. Anticipating mental demand was particularly
challenging. No significant differences were found between the control and
experimental conditions for post-performance assessments, suggesting that
pre-performance assessment of workload has no effect of post-performance
judgment of task difficulty.

%X The use of eye metrics to predict the state of one's mental workload
involves reliable and accurate modeling techniques. This study assessed the
workload classification accuracy of three data mining techniques; artificial
neural network (ANN), logistic regression, and classification tree. The results
showed that the selection of model technique and the interaction between model
type and time segmentation have significant effects on the ability to predict
an individual's mental workload during a recall task. The ANN and
classification tree both performed much better than logistic regression with
1-s incremented data. The classification tree also performed much better with
data averaged over the full recall task. In addition, the transparency of the
classification tree showed that pupil diameter and divergence are significantly
more important predictors than fixation when modeling 1-s incremented data.

this type of decision making utilizes implicit learning in an immersive
environment, where training stimuli are generated by a finite-state algorithm.
In the current study, we investigated the effects of manipulating
training-sequence length and algorithmic complexity in an immersive
implicit-learning paradigm. Results: training-sequence length interacted with
algorithmic complexity such that performance was best when training-sequence
length was long and the algorithm was simple, and when training-sequence length
was short and the algorithm was complex. When training intuitive decision
making, training-sequence length should be matched to algorithmic complexity.

%X Military personnel must perform in complex contested environments, where the
challenges of decision making under fatigue or duress are common. An increased
situational awareness will support individual and team decision making;
however, current technological aids often obstruct real-world views and provide
limited shared situational awareness. To overcome these difficulties, we are
currently developing an Intelligent Augmented Reality Model (iARM) framework
that will include: 1) an open source operating system that supports
geolocation/triangulation, 2) data services that integrate voice, video, and
images for facial/object recognition and pattern analysis, and 3) a hardware
platform that integrates a computer processor, encrypted wireless,
camera/video, and visor display. iARM will address various issues confronting
soldiers today. Currently, access to information may be slow and inaccurate,
information may be context-ignorant, systems do not learn over time, and
handheld devices may distract from environmental information. iARM's primary
goals are to improve decision making through increased situational awareness
and reduced cognitive load during duress. Functioning as part of the
human-machine system, iARM would provide military support across multiple
domains. For example, iARM could present a flee path or create a model to
enhance collective memory from a historical perspective by sensing
environmental cues. This support would be presented via a naturalistic and
unintrusive information display, augmenting the field environment.

%X Most theories about operators' responses to alarm systems suggest that the
operators' behavior is guided by their trust towards the system which in turn
results from the subjective perception of system properties, namely the
perceived reliability of the alarm system. However, some doubts about that
assumption have arisen as recent research has not proven the mediating effect
of trust. The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between
alarm system properties, trust, and behavior. The alarm reliability was varied
while keeping the other system properties constant. It was found that
participants' response-rates to alarms were predicted by their perceived alarm
reliabilities. However, no mediation by trust could be established. These
results suggest that operators' behavior is not always guided by their trust
towards the system. Under specific circumstances their compliance rather
depends on rational consideration regarding the most efficient strategy.

%X Previous research has shown that search and rescue robots get stuck. We ask
why. Perhaps operators attempt to drive through apertures larger than the
robot, but too small to be driven through unhindered. If this is the case, then
operators should base their decisions to enter apertures on their ability to
drive the robot instead of other physical dimensions. This assumes that
operators are cognizant of their abilities to drive the robot through the
aperture. To test this assumption, participants viewed an image transmitted
from a camera mounted on a robot and drove towards apertures of varying width.
Half of the participants judged whether the robot could pass through, half
judged whether they could drive the robot through. Finally, all participants
attempted to drive the robot through the aperture. Results indicated that
pass-ability judgments were accurate, but drive-ability judgments were not.
Implications for training and interface design are discussed.

proposes Cognitive Chrono-Ethnography (CCE), a new study method for
understanding human behavior selections in daily life. When a study field is
specified, CCE defines critical parameters by conducting qualitative MHP/RT
simulations, and then designs ethnographical field observations and recordings
of elite monitors' behavior in the space defined by the critical parameters.
Structured interviews follow in order to obtain the participants' history of
behavioral development. Analysis of the interview results aid in developing
models of present behavior selections and chronological changes. A case study
of CCE that deals with spectators' repetitive visits to a ballpark is presented

%X This paper presents a new model and methodology, called information trail
model for documenting and understanding cognitive and sociotechnical elements
when humans in a work system use artifacts and transform information to achieve
their goals. In a complex system, humans create and manage complexity by
self-organizing and engaging in action-stimulating behavior (stigmergy). In the
model, humans create artifacts and work practices, and transform information to
organize themselves purposefully. The transformation and stringing together of
traces of information creates information trails for work goals, resulting in
the information trail model. Different individuals create and represent the
trails of information in a multitude of artifacts. Information trails capture
latent work practices and information transformed by humans. Hence, the trails
embed the emergent strategies that humans may use. Design implications of the
information trail model are discussed.

%X This article briefly discussed ways to overcome the limitations of existing
GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection) models and primarily focused on
the human processing of cognition and perception which was widely discussed yet
a moot issue. Regarding mouse activities, especially drag-drop, the experiment
demonstrates a significant difference between the predicted and empirical
results in terms of time. The reason was found to be the following: in
empirical testing, participants were swift in executing dragging behavior,
whereas in NGOMSL modeling, not penetrated parameters of internal/external
operators become sequential components that cause the metrics (e.g., movement
time) to be computed serially. Based on other studies on mouse activity, the
operator of the original NGOMSL is revised to include accurate cognitive
process. In the validation, by implementing the revised GOMS operator,
differences between the model execution time and the empirical duration, as
measured when certain software is used, are evaluated. As a result, the revised
GOMS model with new operators is proven to be effective and provides an
estimate that deviates from the empirical value by at most 7%.

%X Nowadays, companies are building products (e.g. iPhone, Wii, Xbox360, 1.2"
Flat Panel TVs, Dyson Ball&trade;, etc.) that literally strike at the
heart-strings of users through the emotional connection they seek to establish
with customers. It is no longer just about ease of use, usefulness,
satisfaction, functionality, but more around building holistic experiences that
differentiate products/services and create a strong emotional attachment. In
this panel we hope to bring greater awareness of this topic and discuss how the
Human Factors community can play a more prominent role in developing products
and services that deliver a "wow" experience.

%X Employing human factors and user-centered systems engineering methodology
and design principles to the development of smart cities has the potential of
establishing a novel field of research. This paper introduces a novel human
factors knowledge management framework for collaborative education, design and
modeling of the next generation of smarter cities. A conceptual framework and
practical applications of systems engineering approaches to support smarter
cities development is proposed. The human systems component in collaborative
systems engineering aims to ensure that human considerations for learners and
designers have a prominent place in the integrated design and development of
sustainable, smarter cities throughout the total system lifecycle. Future
challenges that collaborative human and systems engineering techniques are
likely to face in this domain are also discussed.

%X The emotional experience of products can have enormous impact on the overall
experience: happy users are more accepting and open-minded. Being able to
improve users' moods through product interaction has clear benefits and is
currently the focus of designers all over the world. The purpose of this study
is to help establish generalizable and useful relationship(s) between design
parameters specific to the sense of touch and the emotional response to tactile
experiences. Participants (N=16) explored blocks of varying roughness,
hardness, fidelity (a real or virtual object), and affordance (whether or not
the object lends itself to being tactually explored). In terms of surface
properties, increases in texture roughness elicits more negative emotional
responses (p&le;0.013) while changes in hardness showed no effect. In terms of
prototyping factors of fidelity and affordance, surprisingly a decrease in
stimuli fidelity elicited more favourable emotional responses (p&le;0.052) and
lower affordance conditions generated faster response times (p&le;0.032). In
addition, males gave emotional responses in less time than females (p&le;0.03).
These results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing as well as product
prototyping, packaging and displaying.

%X Hedonomic design aims to make products not just easy to use, but
pleasurable. Toward this goal, designers often use mood boards of abstract
visual images to represent the aesthetic and affective response they would like
their designs to evoke. We studied the effect of aging on viewers' ability to
understand the meanings of abstract images selected by designers to express
specific affective concepts. Young adult and older adult participants made
visual judgment on the affective images. Data showed no age-related differences
in the judgment accuracy. Results suggest that elderly adults can extract
emotional meanings from young designers' mood boards as well as do young
adults, and that affective product semantics may communicate similar meanings
to users of different age group.

%X Emotional reactions are increasingly recognized as an important part of
experiences with technology, and there is a need for rigorous investigation
into the collection of self-reported emotional data. We examine the capture of
continuous, quantitative, affective self-reports as a complement to existing
methods of evaluating human-system or product interaction. This experiment
investigated 12 participants' use of a single slider (for valence, from very
negative to very positive) and two sliders (for valence and arousal) in
response to approximately 45 minutes of a nature video. Individual differences
and physiological data (heart rate variability and skin conductance) were
recorded. Emotion ratings were significantly related to skin conductance, which
both differed significantly across chapters with different video content. We
observed a learning effect, where participants' response times to probe
questions decreased across blocks. Cognitive load appeared higher in the
two-slider condition, with a possibly larger learning effect, and significantly
longer dwell times, when compared to one slider. Arousal self-ratings were
contradicted by skin conductance measures. We conclude with recommendations
concerning the use of sliders for assessment of emotional user experience.

%X Human-technology interaction research has benefited from the insights of
cognitive psychology and, more recently, from research on human emotion and
affect. Yet, there is a dearth of research that goes deeper into the human mind
towards imprinting, instincts, and the collective unconscious. The goal of this
study was to uncover the product archetype(s) of personal computer experiences.
Young adult men and women were asked to recall their very first personal
computer experiences. The narrative structure of these earliest recollections
matched several of the stages of the archetypal hero's journey as described by
Joseph Campbell in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The personal
computer appeared to be an alchemical tool or book for success on each person's
journey, offering the magic and power of game play, communication, information,
creativity, sensory interactions, and portability.

%X Measurement protocols for hand anthropometry have been studied for ergonomic
product design. The present study developed a 3D semi-automatic measurement
protocol (3D-SAMP) which semi-automatically measures various hand dimensions
using a 3D scanner. The 3D-SAMP was compared with the conventional direct
measurement protocol (DMP) to examine its effectiveness. The 3D-SAMP consists
of (1) fabricating a plaster cast of the hand, (2) placing landmarks on the
plaster hand, (3) scanning the plaster hand with a 3D scanner, (4)
automatically identifying the positions of the landmarks on the digital hand,
and (5) automatically extracting hand anthropometric measurements (lengths,
widths, thicknesses, and circumferences). An evaluation experiment was
conducted and found the 3D-SAMP preferred to the DMP in terms of reliability,
efficiency, and ease of measurement.

%X A novel device was developed that will allow laparoscopic surgeons to
hand-operate standard electrosurgical equipment, eliminating the use of
electrosurgical foot pedals, which typically cause static, unstable and
non-neutral body positions. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to
quantitatively and qualitatively determine the optimal ergonomic placement of
the novel electrosurgical hand controls integrated into a standard laparoscopic
grasper to optimize functionality. Three distinct hand control designs were
evaluated by 26 participants during the performance of four basic inanimate
laparoscopic electrosurgical tasks. Hand control actuation force and user
preference were evaluated for each hand control design. The results indicate
that hand control design 1 (CD 1) resulted in the ability to generate
significantly greater actuation force for three of the four tasks (P &lt;
0.05). Additionally, CD 1 was subjectively rated significantly better for
comfort and ease-of-use compared to the other two hand control designs (P &lt;
0.05). As a result, CD 1 was determined to be an advantageous ergonomic design
placement for the novel electrosurgical hand controls integrated into a
standard laparoscopic grasper.

%X Ergonomic product design considering both anthropometric variability and
user preference is required for harmonizing the target users and products. In
this study, bicycle handle diameters for three size categories were determined
by considering anthropometric variability and preference. To design the bicycle
handles, a four-step process was applied: (1) define anthropometric data, (2)
develop size chart, (3) define a design equation, and (4) determine design
values. In the first step, the 1988 US Army data was chosen as anthropometric
data for the design target population. In the second step, to develop a size
chart of bicycle handle, hand length and circumference were selected as key
dimensions by principal component analysis on six representative hand
dimensions. Next, a size chart of three categories (small: 175.5 mm, medium:
186.7 mm, and large: 196.2 mm) were derived by K-means clustering analysis for
hand length and circumference. In the third step, the design equation
accounting geometrical relationship between the sizes of two key dimensions and
diameters of bicycle handle was adopted from a relevant existing research. In
the last step, design values (40.9 mm, 43.5mm, and 45.7 mm) for each size
category were calculated by inputting the sizes of the key dimensions to the
design equation. To evaluate user satisfaction level of the bicycle handles, a
user testing of three handle prototypes was conducted for 17 participants with
various hand sizes. The test results showed that satisfaction scores for each
hand group were significantly higher at the corresponding size category.

%X Studies have shown that there are adverse performance and postural impacts
when children use standard, adult-sized computer mice; however, the impact of
children using adult-sized keyboards has been less rigorously evaluated. The
aim of this study was to investigate whether there were any postural and
performance differences when children and adults used the mouse next to a
standard 104 key keyboard with a numeric keypad compared to a small, more
compact keyboard without a numeric keypad. A total of 42 subjects, including 28
adults and 14 children between the ages 6-8 participated in the study. Subjects
were asked to perform a series of standardized point-and-click tasks using a
standard-sized mouse with both the standard and small keyboard. During mouse
operation arm abduction and forearm rotation were measured using overhead
photographs, and mouse performance was characterized by measuring movement
times and the time it took to press-and-release (click) the left mouse button.
Compared to the standard keyboard, both children and adults had less arm
abduction (p &lt; 0.10) and external rotation of the forearm (p &lt; 0.05) when
using the mouse next to the small keyboard. When comparing children to adults,
children worked with significantly more arm abduction with both keyboards;
however there were no significant differences between children and adults in
internal and external rotation of the forearm. When comparing performance,
children took almost twice as long to move the mouse between targets (p &lt;
0.05) and were slightly faster when operating the mouse next to the small
keyboard. In addition, compared to adults, it took children twice as long to
press and release the mouse button. The study findings indicate that children
would benefit from a postural standpoint if computer manufacturers sold, and
schools and parents purchased, computers with smaller keyboards. The two-fold
difference between children and adults in the time it took actuate the mouse
button indicate that mouse button activation forces may need to be lower for
children.

%X Grip strength has been well studied in conjunction with product and
individual characteristics including age. Design characteristics for products
targeted to older adults frequently include larger or chunkier handles or
grips. To understand motivation for these design choices, this investigation
assessed grip strength at 5 grip spans of 31 participants in two age groups.
The downward shift in the grip strength/span curve can be attributed to the
decrease in strength with age associated with loss of type II muscle fibers in
all muscles (which was more pronounced for male participants). However, there
was no shift in the grip strength/span curve peak to a wider grip. Thus the
affinity for chunkier handles (increased volume, contact surface area, and grip
span) and grip designs for older adults is not motivated by a shift in peak
grip strength over the tested grip span.

%X When developing a successor of an existing product, it is relatively easy to
involve consumers in the early stages of the process -- one could for example
observe them using the current products, and discuss with them what could be
improved. However, when creating products from 'scratch', consumers might find
it difficult to articulate future needs, to appreciate the potential and
limitations of new technologies, or think about possible applications. So,
consumer "co-creation" in the early creative phase will require alternative
approaches towards user requirements definition, concept development, and
concept feedback. A range of different approaches to include the consumer
perspective early in the development process will be presented. Furthermore,
implications from a Human Factors perspective will be discussed.

employed an Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) to identify the relative
importance of physical factors in mobile phone design, calculating factor
preference ratios and the limits of user discriminability between levels of the
factors. Ten participants interacted with a GUI running the IGA to iteratively
evolve their preferred design. Screen size, button spacing, and phone radius
were varied independently. Results showed that users strongly preferred their
final designs over initial ones, validating the use of an IGA in this
application. Vertical screen size and button spacing were significantly
different between the first and last iterations. A Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) showed horizontal screen size preference varied between participants, and
vertical screen size and phone radius were correlated. Future research needs
are discussed, including testing the effect of prompt on design preference.

%X Ergonomic product design which considers users' natural-use motion is of
importance to improve the usability and satisfaction of a product. A five-step
process of product design was developed in the present study by measuring and
analyzing users' natural product-use motion with a motion capture system. The
developed process was applied to the ergonomic design improvement of a
half-guard installation component of a refrigerator; new guard designs
(diagonal and arc shape) were developed with the process and evaluated in terms
of validity during the development as two measures (task satisfaction and
similarity of natural motion). According to the evaluation result, the
satisfaction at putting in- and out-task of new guard designs (diagonal and arc
shape; 6.3 &plusmn; 0.5 points) was significantly higher than that of existing
guard designs (3.3 &plusmn; 1.0 points); the difference between natural motion
and product-use motion in new guard designs (1.0 &plusmn; 0.3 cm) was
significantly less than that of existing guard designs (nipper and rectangular
shape; 2.0 &plusmn; 0.2 cm). The proposed process of natural motion analysis
and product design is widely applicable to ergonomic product design and
evaluation.

that a web service that supports creative personalization features by way of

the site and thus trigger more of the user's intention of adoption/use.
Additionally, perceived attractiveness (PA) is found to be a significant
predictor of web user behavior. The provision of user-driven personalization
facilitated by the meta-design approach opens another source for website
creativity, and the endeavor of engaging customers in the co-creation process
would foster consumer acceptance of the web service.

%X Successful performance with novel technologies may be enhanced if prior
knowledge can be used to guide the interaction. However, knowledge alone may be
insufficient to minimize age-related differences in technology interactions.
The goal of the present study was to examine age-related differences in the use
of a novel everyday technology, the Flip video camcorder, when experience with
comparable technologies was controlled. Younger adults and older adults with a
similar level of general technology experience were video recorded as they
completed three tasks while thinking aloud. Comparisons of self-reported prior
experience with technologies comparable to the Flip indicated similar,
significant levels of experience. In spite of similar experience, younger
adults performed significantly faster than older adults on two of the three
tasks. Younger adults were also more likely to perform optimally on these
tasks. In contrast, older adults were more likely to only partially complete
two of the three tasks. Older adults were also more likely to report higher
cognitive workload and lower satisfaction with their performance. These
findings suggest that designers need detailed assessments of users' knowledge
of comparable technologies and proposed design features to mitigate performance
differences in a diverse user population.

%X Sweeping globalization has resulted in unparalleled economic growth,
including increased international trade of hazardous chemicals. Fundamental
differences between nations trading these materials, including language,
literacy rates, cultural values, and technical and governmental infrastructures
has created an urgent need for a common system of risk communication to reduce
the occurrence of deaths and serious injuries that result from unintended
chemical exposures. To accomplish this goal, the United Nations (UN) created
the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals
(GHS) in 1992. Unfortunately, there was no requirement for testing of the GHS
labeling components, including pictograms intended to depict specific hazards,
before their deployment. In Experiment 1, twenty GHS hazard pictograms were
subjected to comprehension testing in two non-student samples from the U.S. and
Brazil, respectively. In Experiment 2, alternatives for five of the GHS
pictograms that were least well understood were created and then re-tested for
comprehension. Several of the new pictograms outperformed their "original" GHS
counterparts in terms of comprehension and participant preference. Overall, the
results of testing showed that only a small portion of the original GHS hazard
pictograms reached acceptable levels of comprehension. Therefore, additional
systematic work is needed to develop GHS pictogram alternatives that
effectively convey safety hazards to a global audience.

%X Knowledge about the level of danger associated with fire hazards is crucial
for avoiding injury when dealing with hazardous materials. Participants (N=107)
comprised of undergraduate students and non-student adults rated 12 one- and
two-word phrases based on the extent of fire hazard conveyed. Evaluated were
four root words (Inflammable, Combustible, Flammable, and Explosive) combined
with three qualifiers (no qualifier, Very, and Extremely). Inflammable has the
same meaning as Flammable but was rated as if it was of very low flammability,
consistent with previous research. Explosive was rated higher than the other
root words but was followed closely by Flammable and Combustible, which
themselves did not differ. By including qualifiers, there was an increased
hazard connotation over the root word alone, with the qualifier Extremely
producing significantly higher ratings than with the qualifier Very. Even
though Inflammable was rated erroneously as low in flammability when Very or
Extremely were added, participants (particularly non-students) gave higher
ratings of hazard than the root word alone. Analyses including demographic
variables showed the ratings of the terms interacted with student status and
age, which were mainly due to how the term Inflammable was rated. The evidence
suggests that Explosive is a good term to express severe fire hazard, and the
confusing term Inflammable should be avoided as much as possible. The results
give some guidance on terminology in warnings that could be useful in matching
connotations of hazard words with different danger levels.

%X Consumer's interpretation and understanding of the commonly encountered
instruction/warning "do not leave unattended" with respect to three different
types of consumer products were examined. Two hundred and eleven respondents
were surveyed in the Los Angeles, CA area. The majority of the participants
interpreted the phrase differently than how the warning designer intended. The
results were also affected by the type of consumer product, for example:
battery charger v. cooking appliance v. open flame. The results offer
interesting insight into the varying understandings that consumers possess of
statements similar to "do not leave [product] unattended" with respect to
different types of consumer products. The consequences of the misunderstandings
are significant if the warning designer's is relying upon the instruction to
ensure the safety of the products and the end user. The results also highlight
the necessity of using explicit and specific information when providing
consumer instructions and warnings to ensure that the intent of the warning is
adequately communicated and the importance of testing warning text to ensure
product users understand the intended meaning of the warning.

information and promotion of safe behavior. The present study examined how
compliance is affected by viewing duration of product manual warnings and the
presence and content of on-product warnings for a computer memory installation
task involving an electrostatic discharge hazard. Analyses showed that both the
presence of an ANSI-style label and longer manual exposure increased behavioral
compliance. The additive effect of exposure time and label presence and content
suggest that both previous exposure to warning information and effective
on-product warning design benefit compliance.

%X This preliminary investigation evaluates the impact of pictograms and signal
words that would be present on chemical product labels following the
modification of the Hazard Communication Standard by OSHA to incorporate the
United Nation's Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of
Chemicals (GHS). The GHS classification for a given hazard determines the
hazard classification category (Category 1 or Category 2), if a pictogram
and/or a signal word will be present on the label, and the hazard and
precautionary statements that would appear on the label. Participants were able
to refer to samples of chemical product labels to assist them in completing an
on-line questionnaire. The hazard classification category and the presence of a
signal word ("Danger" or "Warning") were significant with regard to the level
of perceived risk by individuals, but there was no significant effect for
pictograms on the sample chemical product labels.

%X All highway accidents in South Dakota occurring during 2006 and occurring in
the vicinity of work-zones were identified. The 367 formal reports filed with
the state Department of Transportation by law enforcement officers
investigating the accidents were provided to us. We categorized each accident
according to the type of road environment involved, the type of accidental
contacts between vehicles that occurred, lighting conditions, demographic
descriptors of the drivers involved, and a tentative finding of fault.
Preliminary reduction of this data pool suggests that males under the age of 25
were overrepresented in work-zone accidents, and that drivers over the age of
65 were under-represented, particularly at night. Among 170 accidents involving
front-to-rear-end contact we defined a subgroup of 125 that were characterized
by Misperceived Closure Rate judgments. 116 such misperceptions took place in
daylight or twilight, only 9 in darkness. Drunk driving was associated with
only 3 of these accidents.

%X A driving simulator study of perceptual countermeasures to speeding is
described. Perceptual countermeasures (PC) manipulate the drivers' visual scene
to help them moderate their driving speed without a conscious deliberation to
do so. The use of synchronized warning lights in work zones as a PC is similar
to "aero plane runway lights" flashing towards the diver. This method was
implemented in a driving simulator where 16 participants drove on an open
highway of 9.5 miles with a work zone of 2 miles length every mile. The effect
did not achieve statistical significance in reducing mean speeds within work
zones to match with the posted speed limit. A frequency domain analysis of
driving speed fluctuation within work zones demonstrated that any form of
flashing lights can have a pronounced effect on some individuals compared to
static lights. This study's implications for agencies looking to implement
synchronized warning lights are discussed in the conclusion.

%X Police vehicles and police officers working on the roadway shoulder are at
risk for being struck by passing vehicles. The conspicuity of police vehicles
may affect detection and speed regulation. Fifteen novice and fifteen
experienced drivers participated in six experimental sessions over six months
with a moderate-fidelity driving simulator. Police cars were parked on the
shoulder and oriented forward or backward with their emergency lights on or
off. When the emergency lights were on, drivers slowed down more than when the
lights were off. The orientation of the police vehicle had minimal effects on
speed changes and novice and experienced drivers did not appreciably differ in
their speed regulation. When compared to the criteria of reducing speed to 60
km/h when passing an emergency vehicle, which is the law in Alberta, only 16%
of all drivers reduced their speed below this limit. Results suggest that
drivers do not sufficiently reduce their speed in the presence of police cars
and emergency vehicles should always use their emergency lights whenever they
are parked on the side of the road.

%X Because haul trucks are used extensively in mining, the operators of these
trucks are exposed to various risks and hazards inherent to this occupation.
The objective of this work was to profile injuries sustained during haul truck
operations, to identify priorities for further investigation, and to determine
potential injury prevention strategies. Data from the Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA) annual administrative database were sorted and reviewed
to select records identifying a subset of injuries sustained during haul truck
operations. Records covering a 5-year period (2004-2008) involving haul trucks
were reviewed. The majority of the injury records were for injuries classified
as "struck against moving object" (STRUCK) (N=613) and "slip or fall of person
from an elevation or on the same level" (SLIPFALL) (N=359). Each injury
narrative was read to determine the activity being performed during the injury
(such as ingress, egress, driving, maintenance), the incident results (such as
operator impact and truck impact), contributing factors to the event, and
environmental factors. The nature of the injury, body parts affected, as well
as lost work days were also quantified. The average lost work days for STRUCK
and SLIPFALL injuries was 60 and 62, respectively. The majority of the total
incidents resulted in sprain and strain injuries; the back was the most
frequently injured body part injured. For STRUCK injuries, the majority of
activities being performed at the time of the injuries involved driving (63%).
More than one-third of the total incidents resulted in vertical jarring of the
haul truck (36%), and the majority of the total incidents caused jolting and
jarring to the operator (75%). For SLIPFALL injuries, the majority of incidents
occurred during egress from the vehicle (46%), and of the total incidents, 32%
resulted in the worker falling. Almost one-third of the total incidents were
due to the operator's foot slipping (32%). Further investigation should focus
on the factors contributing to haul truck operators being struck against a
moving object and those related to operators slipping and falling.

%X Human behaviour is commonly noted as a contributing factor in amusement ride
accidents, as it is in many other domains. However, the category of "human
error" is generally undifferentiated in investigations, providing little
guidance for developing interventions based on accumulated data. As a result,
opportunities to shape behaviour through modified interface design may remain
unexploited. An archival dataset of amusement ride accident investigation
reports was analysed using a tool developed to both classify errors and prompt
extended antecedent investigation. The study found that numerous unexploited
opportunities may exist for investigation of human factors antecedents, with
58% of documented errors having unexplored follow-ups or clarification
requirements suggested by the tool. Further, many of these "missing links"
would point toward factors not generally considered in current investigations,
particularly consideration of design features of the amusement devices that
might be modified to improve the reliability of human performance, and
processes of design.

%X Unlike most advertising, direct-to-consumer (DTC) prescription drug
advertising on television frequently contains warnings. Because of the brevity
of the warning message, a follow-up source with more detailed information is
given. This research examined the reported likelihood of using several
follow-up sources as well as their beliefs about the completeness/accuracy and
ease of access of those sources. Also examined were various other beliefs and
attitudes associated with DTC prescription drug television advertising.
Participants reported that they would more likely to use certain follow-up
sources such as the Internet more than other sources such as an advertisement
in a particular magazine and believed that certain sources provide more
complete/accurate and more accessible information than other sources. The
results indicate that the Internet is a growing information source that people
use to find out more about prescription drugs viewed in advertisements.
Participants' responses indicate skepticism about the goals and content of DTC
prescription drug advertising, although the responses also indicate that they
believe that there are potential benefits of such advertising. Implications for
research in risk communication and warnings are discussed.

%X Pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) has grown exponentially
and is suggested to increase perceived medication needs and patient drug
requests. However, its impact on healthcare consumer safety is not
well-understood. This effort sought to examine DTCA healthcare consumer effects
and their public health and practical implications. During spring 2008, 2767
individuals were asked, through public intercept interviews, about
pharmaceutical DTCA: recalled products, exposure frequency, exposure medium,
and impact on a range of health-related behaviors and beliefs. Consumers report
inundation with DTCA, with 8 of 10 respondents indicating exposure to messaging
within the past 30 days. Television was the medium with the most noted
impressions; direct mail, the least (although still &gt;35%). Most impressions
reported were for Viagra and Claritin. One of four participants reported
cognitive or behavioral changes as a result of viewing DTCA: advertisements
prompted people to believe they had an illness/condition, to seek more
information, to schedule provider visits, and to ask providers about symptoms
or medications during regular visits. Moreover, almost 1 in 5 reported an
increased willingness to share their prescription medication with others if
they saw it in DTCA, indicating that DTCA exposure may increase this risky
behavior. DTCA are nearly ubiquitous yet consumers remained attuned to the
message content. The effects of DTCA are complex and range from beneficial
(e.g., information-seeking) to detrimental (e.g. medication-sharing).
Interestingly, participants do not readily differentiate prescription versus
over-the-counter DTCA. Increased attention to understanding DTCA appears
worthwhile, perhaps targeting provider awareness of message effect, further
regulation and modification of DTCA messaging, and enhancing DTCA media
literacy as a component of health literacy. Human factors professionals have
the right toolset to play an active role in these efforts.

toward safety was conducted using data collected from a survey of 30 safety
managers that oversees the safety of CMV operations. The data was examined to
find underlying factors associated with the respondent's perceptions of
workplace safety. Factor analytic results reveal four constructs that relates
to the managers' attitudes toward safety: financial, internal awareness, demand
for safety, and overall safety culture in the industry. This study provides a
first step in understanding the values that management may place on safety for
commercial vehicle operations.

%X Violations are a problem for safety-critical organizations, which need to
trust in their workers' compliance with rules and regulations. In two studies
we investigate the impact of the framing of production outcome goals. The first
study was designed in accordance with the classic framing experiments by
Kahneman and Tversky (1983) as a paper-based case with two groups (N = 72)
reading a story in which they are to envisage themselves in the position of the
production supervisor, who decides to comply with or violate a safety-relevant
rule in order to meet the production goal. The two groups differ in the framing
of the production outcome goals in terms of losses or gains. In contrast to our
assumptions and to previous findings, we were unable to replicate the framing
effect for a production setting, but 35-45% of participants in both groups were
willing to violate the normative rule, independently of the framing. In the
second experiment (N = 39), the experimental groups acted out the role of the
supervisor and were trained to use two different start-up strategies for the
plant. In the final trial, participants were told that their salary would
depend on their performance in this last trial. As a result, in the loss
framing conditions, significantly more participants violated the normative rule
than in the gain framing condition. Finally, we discuss the implications of
framing effects for production settings and their impact on the probability of
choosing to violate normative rules.

Human Factors Classification and Analysis System (HFACS). The purpose of this
study was to identify associations between active errors and latent conditions
beyond the aviation industry using a taxonomy that systemically identifies both
active errors and latent conditions at all levels of an organization. Doing so
could potentially allow for the shifting of intervention target areas from
active errors to latent conditions. Seven data sources representing five
different non-aviation industry types were analyzed using HFACS methodology and
causal category associations were identified. Among the various significant
causal factor associations, violations were determined be associated with
certain causal categories at the unsafe supervision tier. Additionally, crew
resource management causal factors were found to be associated with both
skill-based and decision errors. Associations among the HFACS causal categories
yield useful information when determining targeted interventions.

safety and healthcare practices? Most people would say yes. However, there is
great controversy as to the form the contribution can take. Can this
contribution be made in the form of standards, recommended practices, and
principles of human factors? Or must our contribution consist of the dedication
of human factors professionals within the domain of healthcare? Some assert
that healthcare is so complex that simple guidelines and best practices will
not solve any significant problems; all worthwhile problems require the
in-depth, sophisticated techniques performed by human factors professionals.
This session will present a debate that examines these issues. The results of
the debate may help focus healthcare human factors toward the most productive
approaches for influencing healthcare and patient safety.

multiple moving targets. We define visual grouping (VG) as a group of two or
more targets in which a participant's eye movements have shown a greater number
of transitions between or among the targets. In order to identify and compare
the VGs, a short algorithm is proposed and evaluated. The experiment results
reveal that VGs can be captured and clustered. Also, the clustered VGs are
identical to the uncertain pair(s) of aircraft that may have loss of separation
(LOS) under co-altitude. This study is one necessary step in performing further
eye movement studies to better understand cognitive processes for a dynamic
task, especially an ACDT.

%X This project was initiated when a poultry processing plant contacted a
university-based research alliance requesting a participatory ergonomics (PE)
program be implemented in their plant to address the incidence of work-related
musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). This program implementation provided a
research opportunity to observe changes in management practices as a result of
the implementation. Management practices observed were related to
communication, networking, and leadership factors surrounding the PE program.
Results suggest that upper management made a financial commitment to the PE
program but did not engage at all levels and did not promote accountability
from project stakeholders. As a result, the program did not engage sufficient
participation and support at all stakeholder levels. Project activities were
primarily driven by an Ergo-Team (ET) middle management member who coordinated
most ET activities and made many unilateral ET-related decisions. Due to poor
decision-making and lack of quality interactions and participation between
levels of management, much of the knowledge and skills obtained through
training and program participation remained within middle management.
Opportunities for quality social exchanges and knowledge transfer were not
availed upon. As a result, the PE program exists at a superficial level within
the organization and the program did not create changes in management
practices. The capacity within the organization to sustain a PE program over
time may be at risk.

HAL (Hand Activity Level) was conducted in six dairy parlors at five locations
throughout the Colorado region for this pilot study to evaluate the utility of
these ergonomic assessment methods in dairy parlors and to estimate risk for
upper extremity (UE) musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among dairy parlor

%X Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a major cause of death in Canada and the
leading cause of death in the United States and Europe with survival rates as
low as 5%. Defibrillation is the key intervention for improving survival from
SCA and can increase survival up to 75%. This has sparked the movement to
increase public access to defibrillation by placing automated external
defibrillators (AEDs) in public areas such as universities, shopping centers,
and athletic centers. The effectiveness of AEDs to revive those with SCA is
dependent on the design of these devices. The purpose of this study was (1) to
evaluate the design features that aid or hinder the effective and timely use of
three commercially available AEDs using a heuristic evaluation; (2) to rank the
three AEDs in terms of overall usability based on user comments and preference,
and the severity of usability heuristic violations; and (3) develop design
recommendations to guide the future design of AEDs. Results of the heuristic
evaluation indicated that a number of design features influence the overall
usability of AEDs, such as the orientation of electrode pads on the adhesive
liner. In terms of overall usability, the Philips HeartStart OnSite AED ranked
the highest, followed by the Zoll AED Plus, and the HeartSine Samaritan PAD.
Recommendations for future AED design include: AEDs should have redundancy in
their activation mechanism; pictorials should be minimalistic in design,
numbers and location; storage of the electrode pads in a clearly labeled,
easily accessible and prominent location; have clearly identifiable liners with
labeling indicating the need for removal from the pads; and match the
orientation of the electrode pads on the adhesive liner to the correct pad
orientation on the patient's chest.

%X This study examined the impact of using an acoustic turn-by-turn navigation
device on wayfinding. Participants used a driving simulator to traverse the
same route twice. They either traveled both times without the guidance or used
a turn-by-turn navigation on the first drive and then replicating the route
from memory on the second drive. Wayfinding performance was assessed by using
route travel time and an assessment of scene recognition Results show that
using a turn-by-turn navigation system negates route learning and impairs scene
recognition. These findings suggest that using a navigation system while
driving creates inattention blindness, a failure to "see" elements in the
environment.

the effects of interruptions which are similar (a planning interruption) or
dissimilar (a non-planning interruption) and are presented during the planning

effects during planning as they do (as in previous research) during the
execution phase of a task. Furthermore, this experiment shows a greater
decrease in performance when the interruption is a planning task than when it
is a non-planning task. Elements of the Fuzzy Trace Theory (Brainerd &amp;

%X Medication adherence is an essential activity for successful self-care,
particularly for older adults who take multiple medications. Adherence depends
on understanding how to take medication, which in turn depends on effective
communication with providers. Unfortunately, physician and patient
communication is often substandard and ineffective. Furthermore, successful
adherence is often tied to supporting the patient's prospective memory by
integrating medication taking with a daily routine. We have developed a
paper-based tool (MedTable) for supporting provider-patient collaborative
planning about taking medication, which has improved performance in a simulated
medication scheduling task. The tool is used as an external workspace that
reduces cognitive demands while also facilitating collaboration in a planning
task. In the current study, the MedTable was redesigned and an electronic
version was also developed. Both tools were compared to a less structured paper
tool similar to medication reconciliation cards used in many health care
settings (Medcard). 144 community dwelling older adults (aged 60 and over)
participated in pairs in a simulated patient-provider medication scheduling
task. Each pair solved four medication scheduling problems (2 simple and 2
complex) using one of the three tools (MedTable, e-MedTable, Medcard). Although
all three tools supported highly accurate solutions, the MedTable produced
significantly more accurate schedules than the Medcard (there were no tool
differences in solution time). Moreover, participants rated workload associated
with problem solving as lower for the two structured tools compared to the
Medcard. The MedTable was also rated more usable than the non-structured aid.
Finally, there was no evidence that older adults had difficulty using the
computer-based tool, which suggests that a computer-based tool could be an
effective intervention for improving provider-patient collaboration.

%X In the early stage of system development, a prototype that is adequate for
testing will be unavailable; then, it would be difficult to empirically predict
mental workload through various measures. For this reason, task analytic
methods based on task analysis probably have been the most popular for
predicting mental workload though they are somewhat task-specific. A
theory-based cognitive architecture could directly represent an operator's
cognitive processes and make predictions for cognitive activity in general
situations at the sub-second scale. In this study, a methodology to predict the
mental workload with a cognitive architecture is proposed. In empirical
results, subjective measures of the mental workload with NASA-TLX were well
matched with model predictions. It is suggested that the proposed method could
be generally applied to predict mental workload in an early design phase.

operators interacted with their mental models. We classified this interaction
into three forms: deriving, updating and applying the mental model. Ten
operators were observed using ethnographic-based methods from the start to the
end of their shift. Results revealed operators' strong mental models attained
through experience as field operators, essential updates of these mental models
at the start of their shifts through handovers and shift meetings, as well as
the high frequency of operators performing mental simulations during task
performance. The methods used here will be refined for other similar studies at
other process control sites. Results from this study could also contribute
towards understanding and bridging the expert-novice gap in process control.

%X In this period of technological innovations, there is no doubt that the
study of technology acceptance and diffusion is important. There have been
numerous advancements in this regard. However, there has been relatively little
cross-cultural research done in this domain. The purpose of this study is to
explore the role that cultural differences play in the acceptance of technology
and in particular, a popular email service provider, Gmail. A mixed methods
approach was followed for this study. Data regarding perception of Gmail
between participants in India (collectivist) and the U.S. (individualistic) was
collected using online questionnaires. Correlational analysis and content
analysis were used to analyze the data. While there was no statistical
significance regarding ease of use, content analysis found that 'else of use'
could be an important factor for the Indian sample. Difference in loyalty
towards Gmail was found to be approaching significance (at &alpha;=0.05). 'Ease
of acquiring' was found to be important for the acceptance of technology for
both cultures studied implying that designers and producers must make it easy
for potential users from any country to get their product. An interesting trend
noticed was that the Indian sample identified social factors like the chat
system Gtalk, if Gmail was exciting, and if it was good when they compared it
to other systems, while the U.S. sample seemed to find work-related factors,
like if it was integrated across multiple platforms or if it was a requirement
with the organization, to be important. The U.S. sample also brought up the
price and brand name a lot more than the Indian sample.

effectiveness of these methods on computer-based warnings. At present, a subset
of the data from a proposed factorial design has been collected from seventy
participants who encountered one of two computerized warnings: a control
warning similar to these that are currently in use or an experimental warning
that contained a number of physical and content improvements. The techniques
used to improve the design of the experimental warning included color, borders,
symbols, improved message clarity, the addition of a warning source and warning
personalization. Compliance rates and reaction time responses were collected
for each of the two warnings. Preliminary results indicated that the warning
improvement increased compliance, though not at a statistically significant
level. Potential directions for computer security software design, user

%X Older adults are faced with complex decision tasks that impose high working

a multitude of options that must be evaluated along many factors. The combined
effect of the quantity of complex information, and reduced working memory
capacity puts older adults at a disadvantage. However, research with younger
adults suggests that the working memory burden of decision tasks can be reduced
using well-designed graphic decision aids. The current study examines the
feasibility of using information visualizations as a decision support system
for complex decision tasks. Findings from this study will be used to make
recommendations for visualizations as complex decision support systems.

%X Today, designers have access to larger amounts of content information and
consequently, groups of people working collaboratively can access and
communicate information both synchronously and asynchronously. The role of
pen-based technologies, and in particular, the tablet PC, has also played an
increasingly important role in how designers communicate through external
representations. By identifying the specific effects of the tablet PCs on team
communication and matching design practices we investigate how technology and
communication shape team design practices. It is also important to investigate
the degree to which designers adopt and utilize these unique features of the
technology. In addition, the impact of attitudes on usage is of important
interest, due to its relationship with the adoption and implementation of
tablet PC features. Under a previous project, students were assigned into teams
based on prior experiences, and tasked with creating an innovative design
solution for a client. This study will use the observational data collected
from that project, coupled with researcher field notes, focus group interviews,
and background questionnaires to investigate if the unique features of Tablet
PCs shape team communication and corresponding design practices. In addition, I
investigate whether teams' previous experience with technology has an effect on
design practice. Initial results show teams who had previous experience with
technology are more likely to use specific features of the tablet PC to
facilitate communication compared to those with little prior experience in
technology. Teams leverage the features of the tablet PC to assist in the
design process produced the more innovative design solutions compared to those
who use methods that are more traditional.

%X Using an eye tracker we examined decision making processes during a
simulated real estate internet search. Specifically, we studied discrepancies
between "stated preferences", or preferences that are revealed through
verbalizations or answers on a questionnaire, and "revealed preferences", or
preferences that become apparent from an actual decision or choice.
Participants viewed photographs of homes, similar to those seen on actual real
estate websites. Average dwell time, fixation duration/counts, and saccade
counts/amplitudes were compared to their stated preferences on home survey
questionnaires and assessed by gender. This information was used to determine
if discrepancies exist between stated and revealed preferences, what qualities
on the website drew the home-buyer's attention, how this may differ by gender,
and ways in which these websites can more effectively be designed. In addition,
we examined the effect of negative externalities, or physical properties that
may affect an individual's internet search decisions. We manually altered
several homes to reveal Level 1 externalities (or, properties that can easily
be changed) such as pink paint on the wall, and Level 2 externalities (or,
properties that cannot easily be changed) such as power lines in front of the
house. Results revealed that men demonstrated a more aggressive search pattern
than women, and the men had a greater number of saccades with shorter saccade
amplitudes for each of the web pages seen. Dwell time, fixation duration, and
fixation count were also found to change when participants were shown a home
with the presence of a Level 1 (pink paint) or Level 2 (power line)
externality, depending on gender. Data also suggested that a discrepancy exists
between stated and revealed preferences. While a participant stated that they
greatly disliked a room on the home specific survey, their dwell times,
fixation durations, and fixation counts did not significantly decrease. These
findings have implications for web design.

%X Working memory capacity (WMC) is generally referred to as a quantitative
measure of the ability to maintain relevant information while performing
unrelated tasks (Delaney &amp; Sahakyan, 2007). Although studies have shown
that WMC can vary by individual (Engle et al., 1992; Just, 1992), performance
can be taxed by varying degrees of subjective workload depending on the task
parameters. Most studies have shown task performance benefits for individuals
with high working memory capacity, with some exceptions for individuals with
low working memory capacity (Barrett, Tugade, &amp; Engle, 2004; Kane et al,
2001; Beilock et al, 2005). Kane and colleagues (2006) tested the relationship
of WMC and executive attention control and found no relationship with
individual differences in WMC and performance on visual search tasks, namely on
feature-absence, conjunction, and spatial configuration search tasks. However,
other studies have found that loading working memory interferes with search
(Peterson, Beck &amp; Wong, 2008; Han &amp; Kim, 2004; He &amp; McCarley,
2010). To explore how WMC affects visual search performance, a study is
proposed to test whether the use of a complex visual search task can
demonstrate a relationship between WMC and visual search performance. It is
hypothesized that a visual search task aimed at engaging the control of
attention and limiting automatic forms of information processing will be
performed better by high WMC individuals compared to low WMC individuals. The
implications of this proposal would help in designing for cockpit operation,
driving, or other operations that require effortful control where the
contributions and limitations of an individual's working memory capacity should
be considered.

%X It is important when solving visuospatial problems to attend to information
that is relevant to the solution. One challenge for learning to solve
visuospatial problems occurs when problem domain neophytes incorrectly focus on
visual information that is irrelevant and may interfere with the solution
strategy. Moreover, these directors of attentional focus often consume
resources in themselves, which may increase the learner's cognitive load and
hinder learning. The current study will investigate the influence of
preattentive and focused-attention visual cues on learning in an effort to
direct the learner's attention to salient information without impeding
learning.

%X The aim of the current study was to identify strategies used in recovering
dynamic objects after long interruptions. The primary task in this study
required participants to track a set of six target dots amongst eight
distracter dots and locate them after a 30 second interruption. In one
condition the dots reappeared in their displaced locations (moving condition)
while in the other condition they reappeared in their original pre-interruption
locations (not-moving condition). Consistent with previous research we found
that the not-moving condition had significantly better accuracy than the moving
condition. Above chance accuracy was found in both conditions. Reaction time
data provided further insight into the strategies used to recover displaced
objects. In the end, it was concluded that pre-interruption location is the
most salient and easily remembered characteristic. Reaction time data did
provide preliminary support for the use of on-line tracking during
interruptions, although such abilities seem to be limited in capacity to
approximately three targets. The results of this research have wide spread
implications to domains requiring constant tracking of objects such as air
traffic control.

plan, stating subgoals, and satisfaction criteria. Results indicated that
various aspects of the task analyses were influenced more by the nature of the
task than the differences in training material at this early stage of learning.
Participants recognized the importance of mentioning the high-level goal,
redescribing goals into subgoals, and the plan. However, the hierarchical
aspect and considering satisfaction criteria were not prevalent in either
recall test or the task analyses produced. Participants in the concept map
condition did identify a larger number of subgoals, but further studies are
needed to understand this effect. This study informs research about various
types of diagrams that are useful for training and adds to the literature on
training HTA itself.

%X Since people have been more concerned about health and well-being, Yoga has
become one of the most popular activities in modern society. However, there are
only a few studies which focus on effects of yoga from a biomechanical
perspective. The objective of this study is to examine how yoga poses affect
muscle activities. Four body muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii,
quadriceps femoris, and gastrocnemius), and five of the most common, basic Yoga
postures ('Tree pose', 'Eagle pose', 'Extended side-angle stretch pose', 'Wide
stance forward bend pose', and 'Dancer pose') were included to identify the
effects of Yoga postures on each muscle. Electromyography (EMG) was used to
record the muscle activity. In this study, it was found that there was no
significant effect of Yoga postures on muscle activity.

%X Many studies have found that "anti-fatigue" mats reduce discomfort during
prolonged standing but it is unclear why mats are successful. This has made the
design and selection of effective mats difficult. An abundance of physiological
evidence suggests that pressure on the foot may be a source of standing
discomfort, but no research has examined pressure differences between flooring
as a possible explanation for the effectiveness of mats. This experiment will
measure the effect of flooring on pressures on the foot for different stance
and footwear conditions. Pilot data suggest that standing barefoot, standing on
a harder surface while barefoot, standing with body weight near the rear of the
foot, and standing with more weight on one foot increases peak pressure. A
single foot stance also results in a migration of body weight toward the rear
of the foot. A larger sample size will establish whether flooring affects
pressures in the shod condition, which will have an impact on future research
into the relation between flooring characteristics and mechanisms for
discomfort.

%X Falls among industrial workers are the leading cause of work related
injuries. Nowadays, many industries are opting for anti-fatigue cushioned
flooring to reduce fall-related socio-economic cost. The goal of this study is
to test SATECH's anti-fatigue flooring for stable gait. A pilot test with five
healthy subjects (25-35 years old) has been conducted with six motion capture
cameras and two force platforms embedded in a walkway to obtain kinematics and
kinetics of whole body gait on two different floors. In conditions where the
same floor material was used on the whole walkway, the anti-fatigue floor had
smaller values of step length (p&lt;0.01) associated with walking and lower
values of required coefficient of friction (RCOF) (p&lt;0.05). Toe clearance,
heel contact velocity, whole body center of mass (COM) velocity, single foot
stance, and double foot stance did not show significant differences between
conditions. The results of this study suggest that subjects were to follow a
more stable gait on the SATECH anti-fatigue flooring.

%X The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of augmented
in-vehicle information on driver behavior in work zones. In-vehicle information
systems (IVISs) can increase driver awareness to an oncoming change in traffic
flow and provide specific guidelines for driving speed requirements, for
example. Three variations of IVISs were examined as the drivers entered a work
zone in a simulated driving environment. The first was a control condition,
which used only traditional signage and no IVIS. The second condition had the
addition of visual in-vehicle warnings and the final condition the addition of
auditory in-vehicle warnings. Results indicated that adding in-vehicle warnings
did affect driver compliance to the work zone speed limit. Further,
participants in the audio warning condition responded more quickly to the
warning than in the visual condition. These were each respectively different
from the drivers in the control condition. Conclusions and implications are
discussed.

%X At rural thru-stop intersections a minor road controlled by a stop sign
crosses a highway; such intersections present major safety challenges because
it is easy for drivers attempting to cross or enter the highway to make
judgment errors about safe gaps in highway traffic. New types of intelligent
infrastructure hold the promise of improving safety; sensors can be placed in
an intersection to detect the distance and speed of oncoming traffic and radio
it to intelligent warning devices in the intersection or within a vehicle.
Previous studies have investigated the efficacy of intelligent signs positioned
in an intersection; however, intersection geometry can make it difficult to
position signs so drivers can simultaneously watch both the sign and oncoming
traffic. The goals of this work are to investigate the feasibility and future
promise of warning systems inside the vehicle, where interfaces may be best
placed, and what modes of information delivery are most effective (visual
versus haptic). Haptic interfaces show promise because they are often effective
at getting a driver's attention in noisy conditions without taking the driver's
eyes off the road.

%X Currently, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems can automate vehicle speed
control to maintain following time-gaps in the range of one to two seconds. In
this study, a field test was conducted to determine whether or not drivers
would be comfortable with the sub-second following time-gaps that could be
provided by a Cooperative ACC (CACC) system. A CACC system uses vehicle-vehicle
communication to enable faster system responses and shorter following
time-gaps. Sixteen drivers from the general public drove both systems on their
daily commuting trips, and their driving behavior and subjective opinions of
the systems were recorded. The results show that the drivers were generally
comfortable with and typically selected the sub-second following time-gaps
offered by the CACC system, but there were significant differences between the
preferences of male and female drivers. The male drivers typically preferred
the shortest gap settings, while the female drivers typically preferred
slightly longer gap settings. The drivers' willingness to accept the shorter
following gaps adds credibility to the assertion that future CACC systems may
have the potential to produce significant increases in the achievable highway
lane capacity.

quality of pedestrian detection by in-vehicle night-vision technology. The
MaxiMin metric of similarity between sets is sufficiently general to be
applicable to a broad range of sensor systems and is not limited to infrared
systems. The metric is an asymmetric variant of the Hausdorff Distance that
incorporates two sets of weights. The first applies a greater weigh to false
negatives (misses) than to false positives (false alarms). The second uses
pedestrian height as a proxy for proximity and, hence, risk. The discussion of
the mathematics of the metric is followed by a pair of illustrative examples
and a discussion of how the metric can inform the design and active safety
systems.

%X Multiple resource models suggest that there will be less interference
between tasks that do not share the same processing resources or modalities.
Most in-vehicle navigational systems rely on some type of auditory modality,
which can be problematic in situations with high levels of background noise or
when one is engaged in a secondary auditory task, such as talking on a cell
phone. The haptic or tactile sensory modality may be an effective alternative
for presenting important navigational information in a vehicle. The current
study compared the effectiveness of auditory vs. tactile navigational
instructions to the operator of a moving vehicle. Tactile shear cues were
provided to the participants' index fingers as they gripped the steering wheel.
These tactile cues provided directional information that coincide with the
direction of the applied skin displacement. In single task driving,
participants made accurate lane changes in response to both auditory and
tactile instructions. In dual-task driving, where participants conversed on a
cell phone, participants were less accurate with auditory instructions than for
tactile instructions. This suggests that in some instances, presenting
information via the tactile modality may bypass the bottleneck described by
multiple resource theories when there is competition for the same resources.

%X Analyses of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality
Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and National Automotive Sampling System
(NASS)/General Estimates System (GES) data from 2002-2006 revealed specific
performance errors and combinations of driver, vehicle, and
roadway/environmental characteristics associated with older drivers' crashes at
intersections. For subsets of the two-vehicle crash data within each national
database, crash involvement ratios based on comparisons of at-fault to
not-at-fault drivers within groups of drivers aged &lt;20 to 80+, segregated in
10-year cohorts, provide exposure-adjusted estimates of the magnitude of
particular risk factors. While FARS and GES data show elevated crash risk for
older drivers, the effect was more pronounced in the FARS data. This
exaggeration likely reflects increased frailty with increasing age; young and
middle-aged drivers may have survived crashes that were fatal to the oldest
drivers. While the data are consistent with the literature in that more complex
driving tasks pose the most risk for older drivers, these data also provide
information about the scale of the increased risk.

%X Recent research suggests that performing a secondary, non-visual task while
driving may lead to a reduction in lateral vehicle movement. A plausible
explanation for this counterintuitive pattern involves the joint findings that
(1) increased cognitive load disrupts eye movements, and (2) eye movements
often precipitate steering input. However, a partial dissociation of these
factors by Cooper et al. (2009) found that increases in workload and eye
movements (at a constant eccentricity) both reduce lateral lane variability.
This follow-up study examines the contribution of eye movement eccentricity,
under varying workload, on lateral lane position variability. Thirty-two
participants drove nine, five minute scenarios in a fixed based driving
simulator under varying eye movement and workload conditions. Consistent with
previous finding, increased workload led to a decrease in lateral vehicle
movement. Interestingly, an effect of visual eccentricity on eye movements was
only observed in one of the driving measures. This research suggests that the
impact of eye movements on lateral vehicle movement is much smaller than
previously hypothesized and that impact of workload is much greater even after
accounting for lateral shifts in eye movements.

speed limits of 70 mph and 80 mph. On the test track, drivers were asked to
maintain speeds of 60 and 85 mph for each of three nine-mile laps in which
various in-vehicle tasks and a car following task were introduced in order to
assess the effect of vehicle speed on driving performance. Subjective workload
estimates were used for the test track tasks in addition to driving performance
data. The results showed no major differences in driving performance across the

the literature often vary due to differences in study methodologies (Green,
2000; Muttart, 2005; Summala, 2000). This paper provides additional insight on
driver braking performance by 1) characterizing driver behavior during the
execution of surprise and expected braking maneuvers, and 2) investigating the
effect of gender, age, and vehicle driven on this behavior. Sixty-four drivers
performed surprise and expected braking maneuvers from 45 mph (72.4 km/h) at an
inflatable barricade, and subsequently performed expected braking maneuvers in
response to an auditory alarm. Participants drove one of two instrumented
vehicles: 1) a 2006 Mercedes-Benz R350, or 2) a 2007 Volvo S80. Drivers'
braking inputs and corrected stopping distance were measured. Results indicate
that drivers' braking performance varied by gender, age, and vehicle driven.
These results and their relationship to the extant braking literature are
discussed. The findings are expected to benefit those involved in crash
reconstruction, researchers modeling driver braking behavior, as well as
designers of brake-by-wire systems.

attended monthly simulator sessions over a period of six months. The results of
the late yellow light event are presented. Drivers were either followed or not
followed by another vehicle as they traveled through a number of intersections
during the course of two experimental drives per session. The percentage of
novice and experienced drivers who ran the late yellow light did not differ nor
did approach speeds to the intersection, although several trends across
sessions were consistent with increased novice driver risk taking or
over-confidence. The presence of a following vehicle did not affect the
decision to run the yellow light, but fewer novice drivers actively sampled the
rearview mirror. Interestingly, novice drivers were significantly more likely
to be caught in the intersection once the light turned red.

%X Collision warnings aid drivers in responding to a collision threat. They
have been identified as one solution to mitigate the effects of distractions by
helping distracted drivers respond to a hazardous situation. In addition to
hazard response, collision warnings have been shown to benefit general driving
performance (i.e., headway distance) and may also influence how drivers engage
in distracting activities. In this study, participants completed 9 driving
scenarios over the course of 3 days while performing a visual-manual secondary
task. Participants responded to a total of 9 forward collision events in the
presence of a collision warning system. Driving and secondary task performance
before and after participants' first and fourth exposure to the collision
warning were examined. Results indicate that drivers were less willing to
engage in the secondary task and were more conservative in their interactions
following a collision warning and that adoption of this safer dual-task
strategy increased over time.

%X This paper investigates effectiveness for improving safety and driver
acceptance of a semi-autonomous forward obstacle collision avoidance system.
This system intervenes into control only when a driver shows his or her
intention to avoid an obstacle, but may turn the steering wheel by itself when
necessary even if the driver hits the brake only. The results of a driving
simulator experiment show that the number of collisions is reduced, and that
the minimum value of the time to collision is enlarged even when an obstacle
appears suddenly. That is, the system is proven to be effective for emergency
avoidance of an obstacle. Moreover, analyses on subjective ratings on
improvement of collision avoidance capability and appropriateness of the
system's maneuver suggest that the drivers have accepted the semi-autonomous
turning of the steering wheel by the system.

vehicle human-machine interfaces (HMIs) in the transportation-related
literature. The presented research examines the results of a mental model
exercise used to explore drivers' perception of a task mitigation workload
manager. The driver workload system was designed to disable HMI functions when
driving demand was estimated (by the system algorithm) to be high based on
real-time assessment of the external driving environment. This paper focuses on
abstracting driver comprehension of the workload system using mental model
concepts.

%X Recently we have developed an innovative hazard perception training
methodology, the Act and Anticipate Hazard Perception Training (AAHPT) that
exposes young-inexperienced drivers to a large variety of traffic-scene movies.
Trainees are asked to act (i.e., respond) each time they perceive a hazard.
Trained and untrained young-inexperienced drivers, as well as experienced
drivers were tested on 58 short video clips of hazardous situations and were
asked to respond each time they detected a hazard. Finally, all drivers
observed six traffic-scene movies and were asked to categorize them according
to the similarity in their hazardous situations. In general, the trained
young-inexperienced drivers were more aware of potential hazards than the
untrained control group. Conclusions and implications of the categorization
task are discussed.

%X Previous laboratory research has demonstrated that symbolic highway signs
which have undergone the Recursive Blur Technique of visual enhancement exhibit
significantly increased legibility distances over standard symbolic highway
signs when using a critical detail identification task. This study sought to
extend those findings to a new stimulus subset, and develop an identification
task that is more conducive to a real-time (dynamic) driving environment. The
effects of recursive blur enhancement on legibility distances were replicated
using the critical detail identification task for both existing and novel
stimuli, but the new holistic identification protocol proved to be an
insensitive measure of the effect. Future research on this topic must be able
to meet the temporal constraints posed by a dynamic driving environment without
sacrificing the sensitivity of a detail-oriented identification protocol.

assess locomotive crew performance with the integration of new market controls,
displays, and automation in the locomotive cab environment. Additionally, the
CTIL will be used to assess and demonstrate new technologies and workstation
configurations that may enhance human performance and human reliability by
increasing the locomotive engineer's capabilities to communicate, plan, and
control locomotives within the railroad system. The CTIL provides a platform
for integration and prototyping of new locomotive cab technologies to assess
the impact of the human-machine interface on locomotive crew performance as new
capabilities are mandated to meet safety, cost, and security requirements.

%X Investigations of temporal sequence learning suggest that both learning and
the expression of learning may be impaired by the performance of a secondary
task. The generalizability of these findings to real-world applications is not,
however, clear. Using a high-fidelity driving simulator, the current study
investigated visual sequence learning in a practice/transfer design that
manipulated secondary task requirements using a naturalistic conversation task.
Consistent with previous research, results indicated that secondary task
performance both reduced visual sequence learning and resulted in impairments
to the expression of learning. These findings extend the theoretical account of
dual-task impairment in complex environments by suggesting that task secondary
task requirements can impair both the acquisition and retrieval of visual
sequence memory.

%X Objective: To develop measures of driver interaction with in-vehicle devices
through capacity analysis. Background: Common measures of driver behavior focus
on the mean values of measures that do not consider temporal distribution of
attention. Capacity analysis can quantify the temporal profile of a drivers'
capacity and the resulting task efficiency. Methods: Fifty participants
performed search tasks on either an MP3 player or its aftermarket controller in
a medium-fidelity driving simulator. A capacity analysis used a hazard function
to describe tasks according to their probability of completion. Results:
Capacity coefficients, calculated as the ratio of two integrated hazard
functions, were not constant over time indicating that the probability of task
completion is dynamic and must be described with more than a measure of the
central tendency of distribution, such as mean task completion time.
Conclusion: Along with other commonly used driving performance metrics,
capacity analysis can reveal task completion dynamics that are often neglected
with reaction time measures, providing insight into how drivers direct their
attention away from the road to complete secondary tasks.

%X Even with advanced collaborative technology, communication remains a
critical component to mission success. With the shift towards network-centric
warfare, standard radio communication needs to meet the needs of today's
warfighter. A net-centric communication management suite called Multi-Modal
Communication (MMC) had been developed. This integrated system captures,
displays, records, and archives radio and text-based communication to better
equip the warfighters. This study examined the performance associated with
monitoring communication channels, with access to different tools. Operators
monitored and responded to the occurrence of critical phrases presented during
a 27-min communication-monitoring task. Communication performance was analyzed
in regard to message detection, response accuracy, and time. Data showed that
MMC provides a balance between the speed of radio listening and the accuracy
and data-capturing capabilities of chat displays. MMC can be a beneficial tool
to operators in its ability to increase intelligibly, while providing a
persistent, searchable display that reduces perceived mental workload.

%X As society continues to become advanced in technology, automation is
increasingly implemented in systems reducing the need for human intervention.
Although the system is the main focus in rendering the cognitive workload, the
human's use in the system is the main component for successful performance.
Trust is a prime factor in building a symbiotic relationship between
human-automation interaction and further empirical research is needed to
develop appropriate methods for designing trusted systems. These methods can be
defined as identifying the prime factors of trust that influence the user's
decision making. The focus of this paper looks at the factor of risk to
determine if and how risk in a situational environment is an influencing factor
of trust in automation. A Global Positioning System (GPS) was used as the
automated platform, and participants went through a series of route planning
sessions with varying levels of risk and hazards. It was found that as the
level of risk increased on hazards, the use and trust of automation decreased.

%X We simulated a generic military crew station and examined the workload and
performance of robotics operators when interacting with a ground robot in the
two modes of robotic autonomy, teleoperation or semi-autonomous. We examined
the effect of autonomy and invocation strategies on performance. The operator
had either full teleoperation (manual) or semi-autonomy (static) regardless of
task load. In a third condition, the robots autonomy changed based on task load
(adaptive). The operator had to identify hostile targets during the mission and
maintain situation awareness (SA) of his local environment and the overall
mission via a SA map. Results showed that when task load increased from low to
high, participants' SA performance was better in the adaptive and static
automation conditions than the manual condition; their threat detection
performance degradation was less in manual and adaptive than in the static
condition. On the other hand, when task load shifted from high to low, threat
detection performance was better in the adaptive than the other two conditions.

%X This paper describes an approach to autonomous robotic control that enables
cooperative, tactically correct robotic behaviors that human teammates
understand. For maximum effectiveness, unmanned systems (UMSs) must be able to
support dismounted warfighters in high-intensity, high-operational-tempo
(OPTEMPO) situations without becoming a source of distraction. Current models
of robotic control require overt human tasking, limiting robotics to low
OPTEMPO tasks. The Combat Causal Reasoner (CCR) proposes to change the paradigm
of UMS autonomy by enabling UMSs to cooperate with humans without expecting the
UMS to perceive the environment as a human would. CCR uses a Playbook approach
to generate responses that are consistent with warfighter actions. An
experiment demonstrated that a CCR-enabled robot measurably increased
warfighter effectiveness and resource utilization, with no loss of robot
effectiveness when compared to human tele-operation during high-tempo
operations.

%X Recently, small unmanned aircraft systems have become ubiquitous in military
battlefield operations due to their intelligence collection capabilities.
However, the operator's interaction with the system and the system's
environment reduces potential surveillance time, thus encouraging further
research into human system integration (HSI). Single operator-focused discrete
event simulation serves to evaluate Human Computer Interaction (HCI) for
multi-vehicle employment. The model incorporates statistical time measurement
for operational tasks, as well as empirical models of HCI performance. Paired
t-tests show statistical benefit in surveillance time of employing autonomous
relay navigation and managing multiple pairs of small unmanned aerial systems
for beyond line-of-sight missions.

%X In general, a human factors design standard must strike the right balance
between specificity to prescribe proper design techniques and generality to
insure that the standard can be relevant across a variety of system designs.
Too specific, and the standard is rigid and minimally applicable. Too general,
and the standards become open for user interpretation, which can lead to
misapplication and inconsistency in applying the standard, producing results
that are not reliable or accurate. The purpose of this paper is to identify
potential considerations that should be addressed in the development of human
factors standards. These issues are discussed within the context of a
MIL-STD-1472F assessment of character heights and widths required for Large
Screen Displays within a physical mockup of a U.S. Navy Ship's Combat
Information Center. During the course of this assessment, a team of analysts
performing character height and width calculations recognized several factors
that may contribute to the potential for misapplication and inconsistency of
standards. The following discussion identifies several of these factors, and
provides recommendations for closing the gap of user interpretation, allowing
for more accurate and reliable application of visual display standards.

%X With the advent of increasing advances in visual display technology,
MIL-STD-1472F, Design Criteria Standard for Human Engineering, was designated
for an upgrade to capture how new technologies may have impacted its display
standards. Large-Screen Displays (LSDs) were subject to review and, henceforth,
the following study emerged. Six variables were chosen for inclusion in the
present experiment: display type (monitor v. projector), ambient lighting
(light v. dark), viewing distance (8 ft, 16 ft, 32 ft), viewing offset (0&deg;,
25&deg;), object type (letter, number, symbol), and object size (in terms of
visual angle, i.e., 6 min, 8 min, 10 min). The variables chosen were expected
to impact operator performance in terms of response time and accuracy based on
stimulus legibility. The results did not support any reductions in current
minimum text size, but new recommendations for preferred text size, symbol
size, viewing distance, and viewing offset were established.

%X It has long been recognized by the DoD acquisition community that effective
translation of capability needs into stable, affordable, and well-managed
acquisition programs requires proper management of technology maturity. The
Technology Readiness Level (TRL) process has proven to be the tool of choice
for assessing the maturity of developing technologies from the laboratory to
deployment. However, TRLs are not designed for ensuring human capabilities are
factored into the evolution of developing technologies. This paper discusses
the steps necessary to bring human systems integration (HSI) maturity
assessment to the level of technology readiness assessment in the Air Force's
rapid acquisition programs. The incorporation of Human Readiness Levels that
emphasize system design in terms of human capabilities and limitations into the
technology maturity assessment process will reap benefits of risk mitigation,
improved system performance, and reduced life-cycle costs when the technology
is ultimately deployed to the warfighter.

military applications has come a long way, but new issues are appearing on the
horizon, which stand to have a significant effect on UMS integration with
Soldiers. The Soldiers' role with robotics, in the future, will range from
operator, to information manager, to information consumer, to teammate, and
interactions will be as varied as the collaborations between man and machine.
As heterogeneous robotic assets make their way into regular duty, researchers
are faced with the challenge of meeting potential issues in a number of areas
head-on; limiting negative influences on performance and increasing
effectiveness of UMSs and human-robot teams. Issues that may direct this
research include the effects of increased autonomy, multi-robot networking,
information flow management, specific task management concerns, and the role of
network science in facilitating the integration of UMSs into mainstream battle
forces. The members of this panel have been chosen specifically for their
background and insight into these areas and it is hoped that their discussion
can help provide both direction and guidance in preparing to overcome the
challenges of UMS integration into military environments.

as well as the creation of usable designs that meet targeted end-users' needs.
Discussion topics will include: prioritizing design options effectively,
cultivating multidisciplinary working relationships, selecting usability
methods that work best, building strategies to address human system integration
requirements for different milestones, and taking advantage of spiral
development in a rapid-prototyping environment. The panel discussions will
reveal key success factors and insights that are generalizable across a wide
array of product domains and businesses.

%X Test and Evaluation (T &amp; E) professionals share one thing in common: a
keen interest in continually improving the methodology they apply to human
factors/ergonomics testing and evaluation of products and processes. Due to
practical constraints of the HFES annual meeting submission process, presenters
of traditional format papers and posters receive retrospective feedback on
their work -- work that was completed at least one year ago! Meeting
face-to-face at the annual HFES meeting would seem the perfect opportunity for
T &amp; E professionals to provide advanced input to one another regarding
works in progress. The purpose of this alternate format session is to promote a
lively exchange of ideas that may result in enhancements to Human
Factors/Ergonomics (HF/E) T &amp; E works in progress. Three contributors will
each present an overview of a planned but unfinished project that can still be
modified prior to execution. Following each presentation, audience members can
propose modifications to enhance the work. The technical input received by
contributors should prove highly beneficial as they go on to complete their
work after the HFES annual meeting and the feedback shared may be of value to
all attendees. The session was first offered at HFES 2008 and was a success.

%X When deciding to incorporate advanced display hardware into Navy submarines,
acquisition personnel must consider its physical form and fit. Human
performance concerns are often neglected, however, since no such methodology
exists within this process. In this effort, we developed a toolkit to enable
basic, low-resource human performance screenings of display hardware and to
integrate results into acquisition decisions. As a test case, we applied the
toolkit toward three display types being considered for Navy submarines:
standard 2D, high-fidelity autostereoscopic 3D, and low-fidelity
autostereoscopic 3D. Using minimal resources, the toolkit produced useful
results that would enable acquisition personnel to gain insight into potential
human performance advantages and risks that would otherwise not be considered
at the acquisition stage of system development. An overview of the test case
results is presented.

%X Airborne self-separation is one of the concepts which is currently under
discussion as a key feature in NextGen/SESAR's future air-transport system.
Self-separation of aircraft is expected to provide higher capacity and safety
levels as well as a better consideration of the different needs of airspace
users. However, in order to become operational self-separation requires certain
airspace structures and procedures. Compared to earlier studies by FAA and NASA
which are based on the concept of shared control by ATC and flight crews, our
approach uses a transfer of control concept where the control authority for
aircraft separation tasks is shifted from ATC to flight crews and back to ATC.
In order to better understand possible roles and role changes of future
aviators, we conducted an integrated simulation study with 15 airline pilots
and five air-traffic controllers on a low-cost simulation platform called
AviaSim. In an experimental design with repeated measurements, the subjects
flew three scenarios with and without control shift for self-separation. The
findings show that operators' workload and situation awareness scores are
better balanced under the shift-of-control condition compared to the
traditional ground-control condition. Additionally, effects of transfer of
control on preferred separation tactics and safety indicators are examined.

%X The most common measurements in the task-based usability evaluation paradigm
include behavioral (e.g., completion times or errors) and subjective measures
(e.g., ratings). Previous work has shown that success and performance in the
test tasks do not dictate subjective usability perceptions, which instead are
affected by appraisals of the system such as those of its aesthetic appeal.
While these appraisals are an outcome of the exposure to and the interaction
with the system, less is known about the effect of predispositions
(expectations) formed before any exposure. To understand how expectations
influence usability perceptions, we devised an experiment wherein 36 subjects
read a positive or a negative product review for a novel mobile device (while a
control group read nothing) before a usability test. The results demonstrate a
surprisingly strong amplifying effect of the positive expectation on the
post-experiment ratings, which, interestingly, held even in a condition where
the users failed in all of the tasks. We briefly discuss implications of this
finding.

%X Self-report measures represent an important means to augment brain
activation studies by providing important insight into participant strategies
for completing cognitive tasks. Triangulating self-report data with brain scans
and performance data promises to yield a more complete picture of brain
activity (Jack &amp; Roepstorff, 2002). The current exploratory study
investigated the feasibility of using self-report measures following
performance on two Cambridge Neurological Test Battery (CANTAB) inventories:
The Delayed Match to Sample and the Cambridge Gambling Task. In this study, we
obtained written and spoken descriptions of strategies used to complete the
CANTAB tasks. We found that participants were comfortable reporting strategies.
There were commonalities, as well as idiosyncratic strategies for completing
the two inventories across eight participants. Next steps include linking
reported strategies with performance to determine how descriptive self-reports
correlate with actual behavior. In addition, approaches to developing
alternative means of self-report for studies of brain function under stress are
discussed.

publications to determine how well they meet users' needs and to what extent
they are readily usable by and appealing to their intended audiences. The
publications were designed to inform and educate readers about the process of
preparing for higher education, both academically and financially. The intended

and counselors. The evaluation followed a multi-pronged, user-based approach.
Our methods included usability testing, focus groups, an online survey followed
by telephone interviews, and a mock "financial aid night" at which participants
could browse among available publications and indicate which appeared to be of
most interest to them. This paper will discuss these user-based activities,
some of the insights that were derived from them, and some of the resulting
design recommendations that will influence future versions of these print

%X Military Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is conducted under
operationally realistic conditions across a full spectrum of military
operations to determine the readiness of a system to be fielded. OT&amp;E seeks
to assess the operational effectiveness and suitability of the system under
test. Operational effectiveness measures the overall ability of a system to
enable mission accomplishment when used by warfighters in a representative
operational environment. Operational effectiveness seeks to evaluate
organization, doctrine, and tactics. Operational suitability measures the
overall ability of a system to be placed in field use. Operational suitability
reliability, availability, and human factors.

%X For the military, the importance of training and education cannot be
understated, and in today's post-Cold War era, the Armed Forces' success
depends even more heavily on rapid, effective learning. Some go so far as to
call contemporary conflicts "deadly 'learning contests,'" in which "a case can
be made that the side which learns the quickest and most effectively wins"
(Metz, 2007: 73). Clearly, to excel in this environment, military training and
education must not only be effective, but it must also be efficient and
generalizable to a large, distributed population.

%X The nature of global conflict is changing. Since 2001, the United States has
openly engaged in an unconventional military conflict defined by a range of
counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, peacekeeping, and infrastructure-building
initiatives. To excel within this environment, the US military has adopted new
strategic approaches, such as Full-Spectrum and Enhanced Company Operations.
Such paradigms share a striking commonality: Much greater emphasis is now being
placed on individual personnel's higher-order cognitive skills. This paper
outlines the operational requirements that create a demand for efficient,
deployable higher-order skills training. The paper also includes a discussion
about current efforts aimed at developing instructional technology that can
help meet these training needs.

(NEW-IT) project. First, key concepts are defined with a focus on two specific
characteristics: task complexity (Wood, 1986) and task framework (Campbell,
1988). The authors then propose the inclusion of cognitive task elements to the
traditional task complexity formulation as an integral extension when designing
scenarios for higher-order thinking skills. In addition, the authors introduce
the variable of cognitive context moderators to the developing equation.
Demonstration of the proposed formulation is then presented with three examples
of the instantiation. Finally, operationalization and future direction for
scenario-based training are discussed.

%X Evaluation is a powerful mechanism for realizing engaging, effective and
efficient training. The data distilled from summative and formative evaluations
can be used to iteratively improve synthetic learning environments,
scenario-based content, and assessment tools, thereby enabling more personally
meaningful learning experiences. In this paper, we leverage the science of
training, psychometric theory, and artificial intelligence to inform the design
of the Scenario-Based Training -- Automated Collection and Evaluation System
(SBT-ACES). SBT-ACES provides instructors with an integrated analytics toolset
to facilitate the collection, manipulation, analysis and visualization of
evaluative data from a federation of systems, titled the Instructional Support
System (ISS). The ISS is a constellation of applications, databases and devices
supporting Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) training via the Digital
Virtual Training Environment (DVTE), a laptop-based simulation suite deployed
worldwide. A machine learning component within the ISS can leverage
post-synthesized SBT-ACES data to continuously tune training such that, over
time, accumulated evidence enables content to be adaptively tailored to
optimize trainees' learning experiences.

%X Research has shown that humans react predictably to unreliable alarm systems
and that some variables may mediate the relationship between alarm reliability
and performance. Researchers have identified alarm design and operator training
strategies to improve task operator reactions. The goal of the current project
was to train task performers to use sensor activity patterns to improve
subsequent alarm reactions. Eighty participants monitored a simulated security
screen while completing a primary word search task. During low- and high-alarm
reliability sessions motion sensors activated in various rooms, requiring
acknowledgement. Alarms then activated, requiring participants to respond or
ignore them. Participants received spatial, temporal, single sensor, or no
training. They were also aware of alarm system reliability levels. Analyses
revealed quicker reactions for trained participants and to high reliability
alarms. Results suggest that single sensor training was most beneficial and
that participants who received temporal training relied on alarm reliability as
a cue.

%X Currently, the FAA performs site-specific training for Terminal Air Traffic
Control students at facilities using mainly non-automated methods of training.
While higher fidelity simulation is used, much of the training occurs in
classrooms and with instructors during on-the-job training, making it resource
intensive and non-standardized. Innovative approaches to controller training
need to be developed to improve efficiency, quality, and standardization across
facilities, particularly as the air traffic system evolves towards the next
generation (NextGen) of automation (FAA, 2009a). The MITRE Corporation's Center
for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) is developing the Terminal
Trainer Prototype, a web-based airspace training system that incorporates
state-of-the art training and data-driven technology using templates for
multimedia tutorials, serious games, simulations, and interactive discovery
learning tools. This prototype has been undergoing field evaluation since
September 2008, first at the Miami TRACON facility site, and now continuing at
Potomac Consolidated TRACON. This paper describes the prototype and discusses
the results of field evaluations performed to date.

%X This study investigated whether stress training introduced during the
acquisition of simulator-based flight skills enhances pilot performance during
subsequent stressful flight operations in an actual aircraft. Thirty
participants with no previous flying experience were assigned either to a
stress-trained treatment group or a control group. Stress training consisted of
pairing skill acquisition in a flight simulator with stress coping mechanisms
in the presence of a cold pressor. Control participants received identical
skill acquisition training but without stress training. Performance was then
compared between groups during flight in a Piper Archer aircraft. Participants
who received flight simulator stress training demonstrated better performance
in a stressful flying task than those in the control group. The results of this
study indicate that stress training during the acquisition of flight skills may
enhance pilot performance in stressful operational flight and therefore, might
mitigate the contribution of pilot stress to aircraft mishaps.

%X The availability of increasingly advanced simulation interfaces has led
researchers to question whether these newer interfaces provide a more effective
means of providing simulation-based training. An empirical evaluation was
conducted comparing the knowledge gained from training with three different
systems: narrated computer animations (Flash videos) that are currently in use
in the U.S. Army, an interactive virtual environment presented on a standard
desktop PC, and the same virtual environment presented on a wearable simulator
with head-mounted display. Results indicated no difference in the knowledge
gained from any of the training methods, although the Flash videos were deemed
less engaging, enjoyable, and elicited less presence than both of the virtual
environment training methods. The wearable simulation interface was also found
to cause greater levels of simulator sickness than either the desktop PC or
Flash video training methods. The results of the current study show no evidence
of a benefit of using the wearable system over more traditional desktop
systems.

%X Computerized training systems may be the only viable solution to accommodate
the quickly evolving learning needs, the short lead time, and the large number
of students that must prepare for cross-cultural interactions. However, current
systems place emphasis on language training, which is only part of the equation
in effective communication. Knowledge about culturally dependent social norms
directly impacts the interaction outcome. A dynamic, customizable,
computationally tractable model for the code of conduct, or etiquette, can
alert us of the specific communication protocols of groups of interest, and can
prevent over-generalizations which can be detrimental to the end goal. We may
not consciously care, or even be aware of etiquette, but it impacts our trust
and affect for individuals, and ultimately shapes our subsequent actions. We
have adapted a socio-linguistic model of human-human interaction for use in
language and culture training. This computational model increases the social
intelligence of virtual actors by allowing them to act and react to human
students in ways that are more aligned with the humans they simulate.
Capabilities for virtual agents to reason about and select actions not only
enhances interaction fidelity, but can also result in time and cost savings in
training scenario generation and maintenance.

%X People operating in today's society frequently encounter complex, dynamic,
and ambiguous situations; thus, people must possess mental agility and the
ability to adjust quickly yet accurately. Therefore, there is a need to train
adaptive expertise to performance successfully. To that end, the purpose of
this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with a review of the
literature pertinent to developing training targeting adaptive expertise. This
review is presented in the form of guidelines for designing and implementing
training interventions specifically focusing on adaptive expertise.

%X Until recently, there has been a widely-held belief that if an infantryman
survives the first few combat encounters or firefights of a deployment, the
Soldier is likely to survive the full tour of duty. Though it has been
discussed anecdotally that military units tend to suffer higher casualty rates
in their first engagements with the enemy, the "first five firefights" belief
has not been validated. In this study, we examined the "first five firefights"
concept to evaluate if Soldiers have an increased chance of becoming a fatality
during their early days of deployment. By gathering and analyzing Soldier
fatality data, conducting interviews with Soldiers, and evaluating human
performance models of common fatality scenarios, we found the "first five"
concept to be untrue. Rather, we identified that Soldiers are particularly
vulnerable to becoming a fatality within the first three months of deployment.
Soldiers also experience a period of increased vulnerability at mid-deployment
and again near the end of the deployment. These vulnerabilities, explored
through interviews with Soldiers, have implications for changes in training,
tactics, techniques, and procedures in today's military.

%X Research suggests that feedback plays an important role in improving
performance during skill and knowledge acquisition. However, little extant
research has compared the relative effectiveness of different types of
feedback. Ninety participants from a large southeastern university took part in
an experiment in order to test the hypothesis that trainees who received
process feedback would outperform those who received velocity feedback or no
feedback. Results revealed an interaction between feedback condition and
gender. Females performed better when provided with process feedback, while
males did better when given velocity feedback. We conclude with implications
and suggestions for future research in this area.

%X Training simulators have become increasingly popular tools for instructing
humans on performance in complex environments. However, the question of how to
provide individualized and scenario-specific assessment and feedback to
students remains largely an open question. In this work, we follow-up on
previous evaluations of the Automated Expert Modeling and Automated Student
Evaluation (AEMASE) system, which automatically assesses student performance
based on observed examples of good and bad performance in a given domain. The
current study provides a rigorous empirical evaluation of the enhanced training
effectiveness achievable with this technology. In particular, we found that
students given feedback via the AEMASE-based debrief tool performed
significantly better than students given only instructor feedback on two out of
three domain-specific performance metrics.

%X Mission success in military operations is determined by team actions and is
dependent on effective team training. Training has the potential to strengthen
or weaken a team, and feedback during training is cited as a cornerstone for
effective training. The Army currently employs an after-action review (AAR)
process to provide post-action feedback to teams. Traditional AAR dynamics,
with teammates and a facilitator in the same room, are being disrupted by the
growing frequency of geographically-distributed teams; thus, distributed AARs
are becoming necessary. However, past research has not determined the optimal
techniques for conducting distributed AARs. This research compared no AAR,
teleconference AAR, and teleconference AAR with visual feedback. Results show
that teleconference with visual feedback condition was the best, followed by no
AAR, followed by teleconference AAR. This research should be considered when
designing distributed military training and feedback, as well as other domains
that use distributed training and feedback.

%X The IBL theory (IBLT) was developed to demonstrate the cognitive processes
and mechanisms involved in dynamic decision making. IBLT has been implemented
in several ACT-R cognitive models that showcase a variety of training effects
and generate predictions resulting from several training manipulations.
Particular implementations of IBLT-based models of training may depend on the
task representation, the cues that are important for that task, and the
particular decision actions involved, but the cognitive processes followed are
generic. Here, we summarize different cognitive models for a diverse set of
tasks relying on the IBLT. We also present an initial implementation of an IBL
modeling tool that will help researchers develop their own IBL models without a
need to program in ACT-R.

%X In information integration tasks, anchoring is a prominent heuristic, such
that the first few arriving information sources (cues) tend to be given greater
weight on the final integration product, than those cues following. Such a bias
may be particularly problematic when the situation is dynamic, such that
earlier arriving cues are more likely to have changed, and hence are less
reliable for the final integration judgment. Such is often the case in military
intelligence, when enemy intentions are inferred from multiple sources. We
describe results of a simulation of such intelligence gathering in which
anchoring is prominently manifest, in the processing of seven sequentially
delivered cues bearing on enemy threat. In Experiment 1, an anchoring bias was
present. In Experiment 2, a simple "debiasing" wording inserted in the
instructions and emphasizing the age of intelligence information induced more
optimal weighting of the most recent cues, but did not eliminate anchoring.

%X This study examined how the degree of automation provided during training
and the general intelligence of the learner operate to influence task learning,
and transfer to a no automation environment. An experiment was conducted using
the Pasteuriser simulation, with participants assigned to one of three training
groups: manual control, user-initiated automation, or automatically-initiated
automation. The presence of automation facilitated initial training
performance, but hindered performance later in training. When automation
support was removed, costs were seen for those trained with
automatically-initiated automation. An aptitude-automation interaction was
observed, such that automation reduced the relationship between trainee
intelligence and training performance. These results suggest that the
effectiveness of automation in training will vary not only by the type of
automation and the task, but also by the aptitude of the operator.

%X While individual differences and their influence on training and performance
have been widely examined in fields such as industrial or educational
psychology, they have not been a strong focus of human factors research. The
present study aims to investigate the relationship between individual
characteristics and complex task performance with special consideration of
interaction effects. Fifty engineering students participated in a four-hour
training session on a simulated process control task and a testing session one
week later. Before the training session, the following individual
characteristics were assessed: risk-taking behavior, general mental ability
(GMA), and need for cognition (NFC). Interaction effects of risk-taking
behavior and GMA, as well as of risk-taking behavior and NFC, on performance
were found. Twenty to 30% of the variance in system control performance was
accounted for by the individual characteristics and their interaction effects.
Findings suggest that interaction effects should be systematically investigated
in future research concerning individual differences in the context of
human-system interaction.

facilitate researchers who are investigating the relationship between
complexity and other training relevant variables (e.g., teamwork skills and
team performance). To that end, this paper defines the complexity, provides the
organizational framework, and offers a context and examples to provide a deeper
understanding of how the framework is instantiated.

%X Pictorial mnemonic devices represent a promising approach to improving the
efficiency and efficacy of procedural training in comparison to traditional,
text-based materials. In this paper, we described the application of pictorial
mnemonic-based approaches to the development of procedural training materials
for battlefield first aid. This effort builds upon prior work both by
addressing a novel training domain and by presenting a method for leveraging
the spatial layout of task symbols within the mnemonic devices to convey
branching and conditional task flows for complex procedures. Examples from the
novel task symbology and pictorial mnemonic set developed under this effort are
presented, and potential applications of these training tools are described.
This work sets the stage for follow-on efforts to evaluate the performance
benefits of pictorial mnemonic-based materials in support of first-aid
training. We believe these examples will aid practitioners to develop pictorial
mnemonic training materials for other complex procedural skill domains.

%X Distance estimation is neither universally good nor universally bad. Rather,
the level of accuracy generally depends on the task being performed. When
misestimation does occur, training protocols have been implemented to improve
one's ability to estimate distance. Unfortunately, results are mixed with
regards to the effects of distance estimation training on subsequent task
performance. Consequently, reliable statements regarding the conditions within
which transfer will occur are limited. As a result, the ability to apply these
mixed findings to real world situations is hampered. As a solution, a transfer
model was created using the Two Visual Systems Hypothesis as a foundation.
Interestingly, one area of the model lacks evidence. Specifically, the effects
of perceptual-motor recalibration training on subsequent ventrally-guided
distance estimation tasks are unclear.

%X Resource training, the cross-training of tasks sharing mental resources, has
been demonstrated using both pretest-posttest and dual task paradigms. Both of
these methods have some disadvantages. The pretest-posttest paradigm separates
tasks in time, making resource relationships less apparent to trainees. It is
also inherently unidirectional, allowing assessment of effects on the target
task but not on the training task. The dual-task paradigm solves these problems
by requiring simultaneous performance of two tasks sharing resources but the
disadvantage is that the nature of many tasks, especially complex ones, is not
conducive to the use of dual-task methodology. Here a third method is used, the
alternating task paradigm. By alternating, the tasks are not structured as dual
tasks yet are minimally separated in time, and the effects of each on the other
are assessable. Use of the paradigm with simple tasks demonstrates that
resource training does occur. While the results are promising, it remains to be
seen whether resource training is effective with complex tasks, and whether
making resource relationships explicit can augment transfer of training.

%X A training transfer paradigm was used to evaluate a virtual reality (VR)
simulator for performing the burr hole drilling portion of a craniotomy
procedure. Participants used a VR simulator that had a physical drill handle
interfaced with a haptic force/torque feedback system. They practiced until
they met a priori performance criteria and then repeated the procedure with a
genuine drill and foam model of a skull. The results showed some positive
transfer related to hand steadiness, but not for drilling time. The drilling
model incorporated in the simulator may require more effort to maintain the
drill position and more revolutions of the drill bit to penetrate the model
skull. Thus, practice on the VR simulator enabled the participants to maintain
better drill position on the physical model. From a clinical perspective, the
findings underscore the advantages of practicing a critical surgical procedure
on a simulator prior to performing on a genuine patient.

%X The modern battlefield is replete with cognitive demands that can increase
workload and cognitive stress. If military leaders can objectively monitor and
predict these cognitive states, they can initiate countermeasures or alter task
load to prevent performance decrements. Training simulation developers could
also use such measures to assess which elements of a simulation affect workload
and cognitive stress. This study evaluated a physiological approach, heart rate
variability (HRV), as small teams conducted military-type, search-and-rescue
exercises in a simulated urban environment. HRV data were collected as teams of
4 experienced low, medium, and high task-load conditions. Results will indicate
which HRV frequency band (very low or high) is most sensitive to task-load and
form the basis of a predictive model to indicate when a team is experiencing
higher workload levels or increasing degrees of cognitive stress.

%X Effectively transmitting alert information to soldiers on patrol is
important and challenging. Such signals must be covertly presented, yet must
effectively represent appropriate levels of urgency. Few researchers have
investigated the joint effects of signal reliability and modality on receiver
trust and compliance. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
alerts delivered through different sensory modalities (visual, auditory, or
tactile) and different reliabilities (60% or 80% true alerts) yielded different
trust levels and target identification behaviors. Thirty undergraduates
completed two sessions of a virtual reconnaissance mission. During each
session, they received 10 alerts about nearby opposing forces. They indicated
trust or distrust of each alert, and subsequently identified the avatar as a
friend or a foe. Results indicated that participants trusted more historically
reliable alerts, and that they showed quicker identification behavior for
visually presented alerts. Future researchers should investigate the match
between modality and threat presentation.

supporting that the EST 2000 is useful as both a trainer and a predictor of

%X As it stands today, PC-based video games are commonly controlled through a
combination of pointing device and keyboard input. Although this conventional
type of interface has a long history of successful implementation, a small
group of people remains excluded due to accessibility issues. This is
unfortunate, because several studies have shown that virtual environment
emersion can provide great benefits to people who suffer from temporary or
permanent physical disabilities. This study is aimed at developing a novel
interface system that will engage this group of users in video game play by
addressing and eliminating the previously mentioned accessibility issues.
Through the combined input from an eye-tracking device and a data glove, people
suffering from physical limitations will be given the opportunity to experience
and interact with virtual environments just like any other user. During
interaction with this newly developed system, eye tracking signals will replace
the mouse input for on-screen pointing, and a data-glove which will replace
conventional keyboard input for in-game navigation and interaction. It is
expected that gamers who suffer from previously limiting physical conditions
will be able to interact effectively and pleasantly through the new gaming
interface, thereby enabling them to overcome their disabilities and enjoy video
games just like any other user.

%X A growing interest in the HCI community is the design and development of
embodied agents in virtual environments. For virtual environments where social
interaction is needed, an agent's facial expression may communicate emotive
state to users both young and old. However, younger and older adults differ in
how they label human facial expressions (Ruffman et al., 2008). Such possible
age-related differences in labeling virtual agent expressions may impact the
user's social experience in a virtual environment. The purpose of the current
research was to investigate age-related differences in emotion recognition of
several on-screen characters of varying degrees of human-likeness. Participants
performed a recognition task with three characters demonstrating four basic
emotions or neutral. The results indicated age-related differences for all
character types. Older adults commonly mislabeled the human and synthetic human
emotions of anger, fear, sadness, and neutral. For the virtual agent face,
older adults commonly mislabeled the emotions of anger, fear, happiness, and
neutral.

%X This study aimed to explore how a three-dimensional (3D) map affects the
acquisition of survey knowledge in complex virtual environments (VEs). Subject
navigated in virtual and real subway stations, where the virtual station was
augmented with either a 3D floor map, a 3D building map, or neither. After
subject's navigation in the station, they made the judgment of spatial relative
directions between objects. The analyses of response time showed that
participants responded faster when they were assisted by the 3D floor or
building map than without a map aid in virtual stations. There was no
significant difference between survey knowledge acquired in the virtual station
augmented with the 3D floor or building map and in the real station.
Participants with the 3D floor map performed best in spatial judgments.
Implications of these findings to a 3D map design were discussed.

%X The science of serious games is growing at a substantial pace, providing new
insights into the nature of game-based learning. Recently, research has begun
to focus on the elements that comprise serious games and how these elements
relate to learning (Wilson et al., 2009; Pavlas et al., 2009). As part of an
effort to understand how these attributes impact learning outcomes, a study
manipulating a number of game attributes in an immune system game was
conducted. From this effort, two psychological constructs initially considered
as mere covariates -- video game self-efficacy and flow state -- emerged as
significant and highly explanatory predictors of learning. This article
provides an overview of these constructs, describes the research that led to
this finding, presents the results of this research, and offers implications
and suggestions for future work.

%X Infantry platoons from both the US Army and UK Army conducted small-unit
exercises in a common terrain database using two game-based simulation (GBS)
systems, the On-Line Interactive Virtual Environment (OLIVE&trade;) and Virtual
Battlespace 2 (VBS2&trade;). After introductory training and a series of
exercises in each GBS, Solders completed usability questionnaires addressing
avatar characteristics, general fidelity, and the control operations in the
graphical user interface. Following the complete series of exercises, Leaders
and Soldiers also participated in guided interviews. Results suggest that US
and UK Soldiers had similar opinions of both GBS systems. Both groups rated
VBS2 higher on avatar characteristics and fidelity scales after exercises were
completed. During the interviews, Leaders and Soldiers identified specific
functions of each GBS that were useful, and described features that were
difficult to use or unrealistic. Leaders and Soldiers also suggested that for
military training and rehearsal a hybrid system should be developed that
combines the best features of each GBS.

%X Games must present instructional elements needed for skill development and
be effectively designed to capitalize on their potential. Questions arise
regarding how to integrate instruction into game play that maps directly to
core domain competencies. We have conducted ongoing research on the utility of
"training through feedback" on human performance, particularly situation
awareness (SA). Past studies have demonstrated the capability for real-time,
in-game assessment of SA. Here, we present data from a demonstration exercise
aimed at further validating real-time, SA measures for development of cognitive
skills in games and extending the research to include assessments of task
performance. West Point cadets performed squad-level patrol tasks in a
computer-based military game. Data on their SA and performance was captured in
each scenario segment and then provided as feedback in an after-action review.
We present results from the exercise with discussion of how SA results relate
to team performance.

%X Specialized military field training can be expensive, time-consuming and
dangerous. Computer games provide a safe, cost effective, and controlled method
for geographically dispersed military units to develop decision-making skills
while rehearsing a specific task. Military units can rehearse building
clearing, search and rescue, or navigation using computer games. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the relationship between task difficulty and team
task performance during a team search task using a modified version of a
popular video game. Results showed that task difficulty decreased the speed
with which the task was completed. The present research demonstrates successful
manipulation of task difficulty in a virtual environment. There were
performance differences based on the sex composition of the teams. Same sex
teams performed better than opposite sex teams. This research suggests
researchers and trainers can modify game characteristics, such as task
difficulty, to design and implement training programs within the military.

%X Currently, there is considerable interest related to the use of computer
games as simulators for training. One of the issues with using computer
simulations is that the controls should be simple and natural enough that the
trainee can focus on the training rather than on complicated simulator
controls. The current research examined two versions of a game based simulator
for training Soldier tasks in an urban environment. One version employs a
common desktop computer interface, while the second version has the computer
components, controls, and the display embedded into Soldier field equipment so
that the simulator is wearable by the trainee. A heuristic usability evaluation
of the two simulators was conducted to determine the ease of use of the
controls and displays. The results found the wearable simulator to have more
usability concerns than the desktop computer. These findings can be used to
improve future simulator interfaces, particularly those employing novel
controls that differ from traditional desktop computer interfaces.

%X A Meta study of four empirical studies of simulator training was performed.
The empirical studies were performed at a battle tank simulator, a combat
vehicle simulator, an active sonar anti-submarine warfare simulator, and at a
simulated command and control staff exercise of an international naval mine
countermeasures mission. The combined number of participants in the Meta study
made use of inferential and causal statistics possible. The results showed
higher ratings of motivation/fun and effect on reality than fidelity. This
suggests that a simulator can provide both motivating and valuable training
even if it does not have very high fidelity. The casual analysis with LISREL
provided a model showing that the feeling of involvement in the simulation
influences the training in the simulator, which in turn has a positive
influence on the transfer of training to real world performance. Since the
analysis is based on amalgamated data from different studies with partly
different conditions, site specific models may be different.

%X The correct spatial registration between virtual and real objects in optical
see-through augmented reality implies accurate estimates of the user's eyepoint
relative to the location and orientation of the display surface. A common
approach is to estimate the display parameters through a calibration procedure
involving a subjective alignment exercise. Human postural sway and targeting
precision contribute to imprecise alignments, which in turn adversely affect
the display parameter estimation resulting in registration errors between
virtual and real objects. The technique commonly used has its origin in
computer vision, and calibrates stationary cameras using hundreds of
correspondence points collected instantaneously in one video frame where
precision is limited only by pixel quantization and image blur. Subsequently
the input noise level is several order of magnitudes greater when a human
operator manually collects correspondence points one by one. This paper
investigates the effect of human alignment noise on view parameter estimation
in an optical see-through head mounted display to determine how well a standard
camera calibration method performs at greater noise levels than documented in
computer vision literature. Through Monte-Carlo simulations we show that it is
particularly difficult to estimate the user's eyepoint in depth, but that a
greater distribution of correspondence points in depth help mitigate the
effects of human alignment noise.

%X Three-dimensional displays and input devices are now widely available. While
research has investigated 3D input devices for a variety of applications, much
research describes custom-made devices. There are also limited guidelines on
the use of 3D input devices. A previous study investigating six
degree-of-freedom (DOF) compensatory tracking performance found that novice
users with little practice performed the task very poorly. This study
investigates the effects of practice on performance. Subjects performed a
compensatory tracking task using off-the-shelf six-DOF input devices with one
device in one hand, or two devices, one in each hand splitting translation (X,
Y, Z axis) and rotation (Heading, Pitch, Roll) control between hands. Examining
Root Mean Square Error for each axis indicated that the tracking task was
difficult to perform. Regression results and slopes indicated there was greater
improvement over time for translation movements for the two hand condition, but
performance for translation was better when using one hand. Research is needed
to determine appropriate settings for the 3D mouse based on task type.

%X In human-machine collaborative systems, human operators usually disuse,
misuse, or abuse the assistance from machines. They distrust the systems with
poor reliability and may be over-dependent on the highly reliable systems.
Human's trust of the assistance of machines currently seems trapped in a
dilemma. It prevents achieving harmonious human-machine collaboration.
Considering the characteristics of human cognitive process, this paper suggests
providing extra cognitive cues to help operators to tune their trust and
decision making. The cues are expressed through variable multi-modal
human-machine interfaces and serve as intelligent machines' human-like
self-confidence, or confidence, in short. To test this approach, a
car-following driving experiment was conducted to investigate drivers'
perception of unreliable visual/auditory assistance. Experimental results
showed that communication of confidence significantly (&alpha;&lt;0.05)
affected human drivers' cognitive processing, especially for
decision-making-oriented auditory assistance. Human drivers felt the machines
were more trustworthy and useful when they showed variable self-confidence.
Meanwhile, a rise in trust did not significantly induce a fall in self-reliance
and over-dependence on the machines. Variable self-confidence continuously
reminded human drivers that the assistance was not always reliable and they
should maintain sufficient awareness of their situation. Using these extra
cognitive cues, human operators are more comfortable to tune their trust in
real-time situations and to build better human-machine collaboration
relationships.
