  abstract = {In this paper, we argue why service-orientation is the
             appropriate computing paradigm to use in mobile and wireless
             environments. We explain how the limitations of mobile devices
             can be overcome by functionality sharing via serviceorientation.
             We identify some key areas that need to be addressed in order for
             this vision to become a reality. We survey existing approaches in
             these areas and discuss what is still missing.}
