  abstract = {As privacy concerns among consumers rise, service providers will
	
	increasingly want to provide services that support privacy enhancing
	
	technologies. At the same time, providers of commercial services
	
	require the security of identifying misbehaving users. For
	
	instance, users that do not pay their bill can be held accountable
	for
	
	their behavior. We propose a scheme that permits privacy support
	
	while retaining accountability. In our proposed scheme an honest
	
	user may enjoy full anonymity, but dishonest users who do not pay
	
	their bill have their identity revealed. In contrast to existing revocable
	
	anonymity systems, our proposed scheme requires less trust
	
	in an external authority, while simultaneously making accountability
	
	easier (and less costly) to achieve. We contribute the concept
	
	of a time capsule, that is, a verifiable encryption with timed and
	
	revocable decryptability.},

	These devices - including pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators

	a broad range of ailments, such as cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes,
	and Parkinson's disease. IMDs' pervasiveness continues to swell,

	life-critical functions. Growth is spurred by geriatric care of the
	aging baby-boomer generation, and new therapies continually emerge
	for chronic conditions ranging from pediatric type 1 diabetes to
	anorgasmia and other sexual dysfunctions. Moreover, the latest IMDs
	support delivery of telemetry for remote monitoring over long-range,
	high-bandwidth wireless links, and emerging devices will communicate

	cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Introduced to the U.S. market in
	2003, this model of ICD includes pacemaker technology and is designed
	to communicate wirelessly with a nearby external programmer in the
	175 kHz frequency range. After partially reverse-engineering the
	ICD's communications protocol with an oscilloscope and a software
	radio, we implemented several software radio-based attacks that could
	compromise patient safety and patient privacy. Motivated by our desire
	to improve patient safety, and mindful of conventional trade-offs
	between security and power consumption for resource-constrained devices,
	we introduce three new zero-power defenses based on RF power harvesting.
	Two of these defenses are human-centric, bringing patients into the
	loop with respect to the security and privacy of their implantable
	medical devices (IMDs). Our contributions provide a scientific baseline
	for understanding the potential security and privacy risks of current
	and future IMDs, and introduce human-perceptible and zero-power mitigation
	techniques that address those risks. To the best of our knowledge,
	this paper is the first in our community to use general-purpose software
	radios to analyze and attack previously unknown radio communications
	protocols.}},

	the Usenet postings which do not contain keyed stegotext
	
	will produce meaningless output which serves as cover traf-
	
	fic, thus increasing the anonymity of the real messages. This

	nodes have only a small probability of distinguishing cover
	
	messages from “real” messages. This attenuation prevents
	
	cover traffic from travelling through the network in an infi-
