% Automatic Differentiation Bibliography,
% collected by George F. Corliss,
% in Automatic Differentiation of Algorithms:
%    Theory, Implementation, and Application,
% Andreas Griewank and George Corliss (eds.),
% SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, 1991.
%
%     This bibliography represents the common bibliography for all of the
% papers in this volume.  Each author prepared a bibliography for her or
% his own paper.  The separate bibliographies were merged into a single
% BibTex database, and references from several other sources were added.
% Especially valuable contributions were made by bibliographic data
% bases previously compiled by Bruce Char, by David Gay and by
% Davis, Corliss, and Krenz [Davi88a].
%     This bibliography includes most of the work known to the editors
% in the area of automatic differentiation.  Because it includes all of
% the works cited by any paper in this volume, it includes many citations
% which are not directly related to automatic differentiation.  For
% example, it includes basic references in optimization, symbolic algebra
% systems, and several applications areas.
%     The electronic form of this bibliography contains many other works
% relating to automatic differentiation.  The electronic version
% is available from netlib (netlib at research.bell-labs.com).  Corrections and
% additions are welcome and should be sent to

                 \begin{enumerate} \item Estimate the local error by
                 matching the series at $ t_r $ and the series at $
                 t_{r+1} $ at the midpoint. \item Predict stepsize

                 tolerance. This is very expensive. \item The predictor
                 formula is an ordinary Taylor polynomial. The
                 corrector formula uses eigenvalues of the Jacobian to
                 distort the series at $ t_{r+1} $ to compute the
                 actual local contributions of the transients. \item
                 Determine the order of the series. \item Detect when a
                 transient has died away, or when it has
                 reappeared.\end{enumerate} A preprocessor written in

                 developments in the application of recurrent Taylor
                 series to the integration of systems of ordinary
                 differential equations. The historical development of
                 the subject is reviewed along with a discussion of the
                 reasons for the existence of present day prejudice
                 against the method. A summary of current techniques is
                 presented including those for deriving the recurrence
                 relations with particular emphasize towards
                 implementation. Questions about convergence, stepsize
                 control and automatic control of series length are
                 considered. Various difficulties such as integration
                 across discontinuities and implicit differential
                 equations are discussed and accurate and efficient
                 remedies are provided. A simulation language, PSCSP
                 (Power Series Continuous-system Simulation Program),
                 is presented. This is used as a medium for testing and
                 comparing the theory discussed earlier.",

                 called {\sl piecewise factorable functions}. With
                 this class of functions it is shown how to construct
                 both Taylor series expansions and gradient
                 calculations of the functions. With the use of the
                 precompiler AUGMENT it is shown how to implement both
                 of these. This is the first publication in English on

  abstract =     "For any typical multivariable expression $f$, point
                 $a$ in the domain of $f$, and positive integer
                 maxorder, this method produces the numerical values of
                 all partial derivatives at $a$ up through order
                 maxorder. By the technique known as automatic
                 differentiation, theoretically exact results are
                 obtained using numerical (as opposed to symbolic)
                 manipulation. The key ideas are a hyperpyramid data
                 structure and a generalized Leibniz's rule. Any
                 expression in $n$ variables corresponds to a
                 hyperpyramid array, in $n$-dimensional space,
                 containing the numerical values of all unique partial
                 derivatives (not wasting space on different
                 permutations of derivatives). The arrays for simple
                 expressions are combined by hyperpyramid operators to
                 form the arrays for more complicated expressions. These
                 operators are facilitated by a generalized Leibniz's
                 rule which, given a product of multivariable functions,
                 produces any partial derivative by forming the minimum
                 number of products (between two lower partials)
                 together with a product of binomial coefficients. The
                 algorithms are described in abstract pseudo-code. A
                 section on implementation shows how these ideas can be
                 converted into practical and efficient programs in a
                 typical computing environment. For any specific
                 problem, only the expression itself would require
                 recoding.",

                 comparing previous work in the area of symbolic
                 differentiation of algorithms. Specifically it
                 considers the work of Warner in 1975, Joss in 1976 and
                 Kedem in 1977. The conclusions reached in this
                 discussion are that the work by Joss is the best in
                 terms of improvement. The author proceeds to describe
                 how Joss' work can be improved in terms of speed,
                 accuracy and space. A package, Jake, is described
                 which is a compiler that takes a Fortran 66 input
                 definition of a function. This input is limited in
                 that only one subroutine can be specified, and that
                 certain Fortran 66 statements are disallowed. Jake is
                 instructed on how to perform its task by directives
                 within the subroutine. Timing results are provided on
                 the performance of the code produced by Jake over
                 those where finite differencing is used.",

  abstract =     "Consider the vector-valued function $$ y = f(x),
                 \quad f : R^m \rightarrow R. $$ The authors consider
                 calculating the partial derivatives $$ \frac{\partial
                 y}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} $$
                 for each $ 1 \le i \le m $. The first method of
                 calculation, called the {\sl forward method \/}, uses
                 the variational form $$ \partial y = \frac{\partial
                 f}{\partial x_i} \partial x_i $$. The second method of
                 calculation, called the {\sl back method \/}, uses the
                 adjoint variational form $$ \partial \overline{x}_i =
                 \left(\frac{\partial f} {\partial x_i}\right)^T
                 \partial \overline{y} $$ where $\overline{.}$ means
                 adjoint variable and sign T means transposition. The
                 forward method has been discussed elsewhere in the
                 literature, see [Rall81a]. The authors discuss the
                 relative merits of both methods. They provide results
                 which show that the forward method is the more space
                 efficient and the back method is the more time
                 efficient. The authors combine the two methods to
                 produce a {\sl multilevel method \/} which is a
                 compromise of the two methods. This has the property
                 that the memory requirements are better than the back
                 method and the time requirements are better than the
                 forward method.",
