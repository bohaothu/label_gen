		annote="The author describes a geometrical approach for satellite planning and scheduling. His goal is to build dynamic schedules that can be replanned all the time. To realize this goal, the planner of order forms was introduced. Since the better the schedule, the more fragile it usually is, the planner is able to build new good schedules when the order form was changed. A good idea, based on this article, is to create an algorithm, which can uses less optimized schedules to build a new schedule at the short period of time.",

These components can be implemented to our problem with a few changes, since both problems are related. There is a very usefull idea to use the Hill Climbing approach for such type of problem because it is impossible to find complete solution for real-word conditions.",

 annote="This paper presents a genetic algorithm to solve the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. The genetic algorithm proposed in this study extends search space by purposefully generating and including infeasible solutions in the population. Instead of trying to maintain feasibility with crossover operations, it searches through both feasible and infeasible regions for good quality solutions. It is also shown in the article that the size of the infeasible region defined by solutions with subtours dominates that of a feasible region in the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. A comparative computational study using benchmark problems shows that the proposed genetic algorithm is a viable option for hard asymmetric traveling salesman problems."

Identical positions are copied over to two offspring to start creating new chromosomes.  Each operaton creates the rest of the chromosome in slightly different ways.  After a new chromosome is created it can be mutated by techniques of swapping and shifting.  The algorithms are easy to execute and are proven to be very effective when compared to 11 other methods.

The first algorithm places jobs on a line that have start times, end times, but no processing times.  It considers a weighted case where a profit is gained if a location is visited during its time window.  The goal is to maximize the profit.  The second algorithm considers a case of asymmetric distances between locations.  The algorithm finds a path that visits a certain number of locations during their windows.  The basic procedures of the algorithms involves the creation of an arc weighted directed acyclic graph and the calculations of a maximum-weighted path.
