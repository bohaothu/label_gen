ABSTRACT="Grapevine is a software package that provides facilities for
the delivery of electronic mail, for naming people, machines, and
services; for authenticating people and machines; and for locating
services on the internet. Very interesting in the context of multicast
are the ways proposed for dealing with groups (of servers, mail
recipients etc.) In terms of reliability and consistency, the proposed
algorithms are rather relaxed.",

abstract =     "Scalable shared-memory multiprocessors combine the
                ease of programming of a single address space with the
                ability to scale performance as the system grows from a
                few processors to a few thousand processors. The major
                challenge in such machines lies in the design of a
                memory system that has both low latency and high
                bandwidth. Directory-based cache coherence can
                potentially satisfy both of these goals. Caching
                provides low latency, while the directory supports
                coherence without compromising bandwidth. The focus of
                this dissertation is the design of distributed
                directory-based multiprocessors. The vehicle used to
                drive the investigation has been the implementation of
                the DASH prototype system. The detailed design of the
                prototype has shown that while directory-based systems
                are complex, they are feasible. The issues that must be
                addressed in their design include: vproviding scalable
                memory bandwidth with limited overhead cost, reducing
                and hiding the latency of a physically large memory
                system, and managing the concurrency problems
                introduced by the highly parallel execution
                environment. The DASH prototype is the first
                operational machine to include a scalable
                cache-coherence mechanism. Analysis of the prototype
                has led to new insights into directory-based systems.
                First, the prototype shows that the complexity of
                directory-based protocols is manageable and that the
                hardware overhead can be kept quite low (less than 20\%
                in the prototype). Second, while a single-address space
                can simplify use of a parallel system, it does not
                imply that interprocessor communication is free. Remote
                memory latency is significant ($>$100 processor clocks
                in the prototype), and good cache and memory locality
                are important to achieve high performance. Third, and
                most important of all, running parallel applications on
                the prototype has demonstrated that high-performance
                and near linear speedups are possible on this class of
                machine. Finally, the preliminary design of a very
                large-scale, highly integrated DASH system indicates
                that the architecture can be scaled in today's
                technology to a system with over 2000 processors and 1
                TeraOPS in peak performance.",

abstract =     "This thesis examines the problem of cache organization
          for very large-scale distributed file systems (DFSs).
          Conventional DFSs, based on the client--server model,
          suffer from bottlenecks when the total client load
          exceeds the server's capacity. Previous work has
          suggested that hierarchical client organizations can
          ameliorate the problem somewhat, but at the expense of
          a substantial increase in client latency. An analysis
          of existing DFS workloads reveals that there is
          considerable regularity in client file access patterns
          and that widely shared files lend themselves especially
          well to caching techniques. In particular, a large
          proportion of ``cache miss'' traffic is for files that
          are already copied in another client's cache. If
          clients can share these cached files, the server's load
          can be reduced by a potentially large margin, making
          larger-scale systems possible. We introduce the notion
          of {\em dynamic hierarchical caching}, in which
          adaptive client hierarchies are constructed on a file -
          by - file basis. Trace - driven simulation and workload
          - driven runs of a prototype file system suggest that
          dynamic hierarchies can reduce server load
          substantially without the client performance penalties
          associated with more static schemes.",
