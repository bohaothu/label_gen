  abstract	= {A software engineering course is often the capstone of a
		  general undergraduate curriculum in computer science. It is
		  usually at least partly a project-based course, with the
		  intention that student groups can deploy their already
		  acquired skills on programming, verification, databases,
		  and human-computer interaction, while applying the new
		  material about requirements, architecture, and project
		  management on a project. I have taught a software
		  engineering course six times over the last few years, using
		  a combination of ideas that I have never seen elsewhere,
		  with a strong emphasis on realism. I here reflect on the
		  rewards and risks of this approach, and make some
		  recommendations for future offerings.}
