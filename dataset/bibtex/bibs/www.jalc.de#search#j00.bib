    the splicing operation, a language-theoretic counterpart of

    least) linear sets of rules are used, then characterizations 
    of recursively enumerable languages are obtained. The power 
    of the intermediate class of H systems, with regular sets of 
    splicing rules, is not yet known. We settle here the 
    question, by proving that extended H systems with finite 
    sets of axioms and regular sets of rules characterize the 
    recursively enumerable languages, thus having the full power 
    of Turing machines (in fact, one axiom is shown to suffice).}

    replacement systems are a generalization of the cellular 
    automata (CA) paradigm which constitutes an inherently 
    massive-parallel model of computation. The usage of a set 
    of productions instead of a CA's local transition function 
    allows us not only to formulate state transitions, but 
    furthermore temporal modifications of the cellular structure 
    itself. Consequently the concept can be used as an abstract 
    model of computation for those applications which are based 
    on irregular and dynamically changing meshes, i.e. the 
    simulation of biological systems, dynamic sceneries in 
    computer graphics and adaptive mesh generation algorithms.}

    by linking our modeling with an enough studied domain of 
    algebra not yet considered in this context and by suggesting 
    a new area for applying formal languages to concurrent 
    programming abstraction dealing with such interleaved 
    sequences of ``atomic instructions''.\par
    These semirings are obtained by combining the well-known 
    operations of catenation, anti-catenation, and shuffle, and, 
    by considering that the set of elementary actions is 
    decomposed in two subsets --- critical (protected) and 
    noncritical (ordinary) actions. Whereas the catenation  
    (anti-catenation) corresponds to sequential composition of 
    processes with the priority of the first (second) process, 
    the shuffle operation defines free or pure parallel 
    composition of concurrent processes. The need of the 
    intermediate operations is strongly motivated by the theory 
    of concurrent processes and by the practice of concurrent 
    programming. Indeed critical sections frequently exist 
    inside concurrent processes and, moreover, the priority of 
    processes can be modified during the execution, using a 
    pre-defined strategy. The proposed modeling results in two 
    fundamental principles in explaining the semantics of 
    parallelism, independently of some technical

    some of them even manufactured as special purpose 
    processors. Moreover, several design and transformation 
    methodologies and software tools for the development of 
    systolic systems have been worked out. However, the 
    definitions and analysis of very basic concepts and results 
    concerning systolic systems and their transformations seem 
    to be still missing the rigour, abstraction and analysis 
    required by the current design and correctness theory 
    standards and also by applications. The aim of this paper is 
    to remedy this situation by presenting a natural fixpoint 
    semantics of synchronous systems (including semi-systolic 
    and systolic) and by making precise and analysing in which 
    way the basic transformations of these systems (retiming and 
    slowdown) preserve their semantics.}

    programs of some programming language $P$ in such a way that
    non-context-free constraints of $P$ are already checked in

    languages allowing to perform the decoding of infinite words

    languages do not ensure a single deciphering. We show that

    is an equivalence relation defined on ${\cal M}$ which is not

    the cost, in terms of states, of the optimal simulation of 
    two-way (or also one-way) nondeterministic by two-way 
    deterministic automata. The question, which was proposed in 
    1978 by {\sc W. Sakoda} and {\sc M. Sipser}, is still open. 
    In this paper, we aim to give some contributions to the 
    investigation of this problem. We show that in the 
    \emph{unary} case, namely for automata with a one-letter 
    input alphabet, the question can be restricted to studying 
    the cost of simulating \emph{quasi sweeping} two-way 
    nondeterministic automata accepting \emph{cyclic languages} 
    by two-way deterministic automata. Next, we prove a tight 
    lower bound on the number of states of two-way deterministic,
    nondeterministic, and quasi sweeping automata accepting unary 
    languages. We also show that any one-way nondeterministic 
    automaton accepting a unary cyclic language can be simulated 
    by a two-way deterministic automaton without increasing the 
    number of states. This simulation, which is shown to be 
    optimal, improves the known quadratic simulation for unary 
    regular languages.}
