                 land-based and wireless communication network
                 infrastructure are the existing technical prerequisites
                 for continuous access to networked services. This
                 relieves users from being bound to their desktop
                 computers and lets them spread out into the world. But
                 using the different mobile facilities often requires a
                 lot of special concern and there is no straight-forward
                 solution towards an integrated mobile environment. This
                 paper examines an approach to extend existing systems
                 by transparently introducing a mobility service system
                 to meet the special needs of mobile users. Typical
                 mobile communication problems such as frequent
                 disconnection, low bandwidth or a changing network
                 environ- ment are hidden embedding the user into a

  abstract =     "Disconnected operation is an important technique for
                 providing mobile access to shared data in distributed
                 file systems. However, data inconsistency resulting
                 from partitioned sharing remains a serious concern.
                 This paper presents a new mechanism called
                 isolation-only transaction (IOT) that uses
                 serializability constraints to automatically detect
                 read/write conflicts. The IOT consistency model
                 provides a set of options for automatic and manual
                 conflict resolution. In addition, application specific
                 knowledge can be incorporated to detect and resolve
                 conflicts. To preserve upward Unix compatibility, the
                 IOT mechanism is provided as an optional file system
                 facility and its flexible interfaces allow any existing
                 Unix application to be executed as an IOT. This paper
                 describes high level system design and implementation
                 and concludes with related work and current status.",
