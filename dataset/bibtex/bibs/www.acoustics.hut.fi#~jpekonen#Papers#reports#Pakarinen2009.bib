	Abstract = {Several interesting mobile applications using sound synthesis and audio effects processing have emerged in the last few years. As the processing power and sensor arsenal of mobile devices has constantly increased, many of these applications are able to turn the mobile device into a new musical instrument with fascinating new sonic properties. This report discusses the technical possibilities given by modern mobile platforms and reviews the state-of-the-art applications for sound synthesis and effects processing in the mobile context.},
