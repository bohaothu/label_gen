                          abstract = {Many research teams have developed mobile computing architectures to
support the emergency and rescue services in a range of civil contingencies. These
proposals are based on innovative technologies and show considerable creativity in the
design of their user interfaces. In contrast, this paper presents lessons learned from the
2007 UK floods. Mobile telecommunications failed in many different ways and from
many different causes, including physical damage to handsets, as well as the loss of
base stations and UPSs. The insights gained from the floods are being used to inform
the design of next generation mobile digital communications systems for UK
responders. However, the technical problems are arguably less important than the
insights that were obtained about ‘systemic’ failures in the interfaces between local
government, emergency services and the variety of agencies that must cooperate in
major civil contingencies. Problems in information management led to inconsistencies
and incompatibilities. In consequence, the output from one application could not easily
be used as input to systems operated by other agencies. These issues must be addressed
before we are overwhelmed by the increased bandwidth afforded by new mobile
devices and novel sensing technologies. It is concluded that unless we understand the
chaos, complexity and the contextual issues that characterise previous emergency
situations then there is little prospect that we will be able to design effective mobile
technologies for future incidents.},keywords = {accident analysis; national critical infrastructures; mobile devices.},Publisher =
