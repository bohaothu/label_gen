  abstract = {{I}n order to develop a sensitive and reliable method for {FFA} quantification in lipid matrices of seeds, two {SPE} procedures employed in meat and dairy chemistry were compared using a 100/1 mixture of triolein/heptadecanoic acid. {T}he overall efficiency of the {SPE} procedure retained was satisfactory since it allowed removal of 99.8% of triacylglycerols ({TAG}) and recovery of 99.2% of {FFA} as quantified by gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters ({FAME}). {H}owever, the low amount of {TAG} eluted in the {FFA} fraction represented a non-negligible percentage (17%) of {FAME} and the procedure thus required further improvement. {TAG} pollution was successively decreased to 12%, 8% and finally 1.5% by: i) modifying the volume of elution of {TAG}; ii) removing the saponification step initially performed according to the standard {FAME} procedure; and iii) reducing the duration of the {BF}3-catalyzed methylation reaction to 1 min. {T}he new {SPE}/methylation procedure described here was then compared to the most widely used method for {FFA} measurement in plants which is based on thin-layer chromatography ({TLC}). {B}oth procedures were applied to coffee seeds stored for 0-18 months at 15 degrees {C} under 62% relative humidity and provided consistent results. {A} very clear negative correlation was observed between the loss of seed viability and the accumulation of {FFA} in seeds during the course of storage independent of the method employed for {FFA} quantification. {H}owever, we demonstrated that the {TLC}/on-silica methylation procedure underestimates {FFA} contents in comparison with the new {SPE}/methylation procedure because of a selective loss of unsaturated {FA}.},
