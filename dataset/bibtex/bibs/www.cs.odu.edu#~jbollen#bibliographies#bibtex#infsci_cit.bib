@ARTICLE{freque:hooten1991,
  author = {Patricia A. Hooten},
  title = {Frequency and Functional Use of Cited Documents in Information Science},
  year = 1991,
  journal = {Journal of the American Society for Information Science},
  volume = 42,
  number = 6,
 pages = {397--404},
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine factors which may explain frequency and nature of use of documents in citing document texts over time. Articles published in the Journal of the American Society for Information Science in 1972, 1973, and 1974 were searched on SciSearch to derive two sample groups. One group was frequently cited; the other was infrequently cited. The functional uses of the sample document groups were examined by four classification taxonomies in 417 citing contexts. The patterns of frequency of use, multiple use, and functional use were examined over time. The citation levels of documents citing the two sample groups were examined as well. When measured by functional citation taxonomies, frequently and infrequently cited documents were not used for significantly different functions. Frequently cited documents, however, seemed more tightly linked (essential) than infrequently cited documents to the documents in which they were used. While frequently cited documents were not judged more useful than infrequently cited documents initially, they were used at a stable higher level over a longer period. Infrequently cited documents were used immediately following publication and then their use rapidly diminished. The repeated use of infrequently cited documents within documents tended to decrease over time while the repeated use of frequently cited documents tended to increase. Frequently cited articles were used for different functions in the period immediately following publication and a later time period. Infrequently cited articles were used with greater consistency in the two time periods.},

@ARTICLE{combin:everett1991,
  title = {A Combined LogLinear/{MDS} Model for Mapping Journals by Citation Analysis},
  author = {James E. Everett and Antony Pecotich},
  year = 1991,
  journal = {Journal of the American Society for Information Science},
  volume = 42,
  number = 6,
  pages = {405--413},
  abstract = {Loglinear analysis of interjournal citations permits objective evaluation of the network of journals in and around a discipline. Citation frequency is modeled as a probabilistic Poisson process, with its expectation being the product of the influence of the cited journal on the citing journal, and of the citing journal's receptivity. The influence is itself modeled as the product of the cited journal's importance, and of the similarity between the two journals. Loglinear analysis is used to extract maximum likelihood estimates of journals' importances and receptivities and a matrix of similarities from their citation matrix. Multidimensional scaling of the derived similarities matrix provides an interpretable map of the journals' relative configuration. As an application of the method, the major marketing journals are mapped relative to journals of related disciplines, showing the influence that the psychology and management disciplines have had upon the marketing literature. },

@ARTICLE{conver:borgman1992,
  title = {The convergence of information science and communication: A bibliometric analysis},
  author = {Christine L. Borgman and Ronald E. Rice},
  year = 1992,
  journal = {Journal of the American Society for Information Science},
  volume = 43,
  number = 6,
  pages = {397-411},
abstract = {This study asks whether the disciplines of information science and communication are converging, as indicated by a bibliometric study of all core journals of both disciplines in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI.) for the period 1977 to 1987. Results show very little convergence between these disciplines, at least on the basis of cross-disciplinary journal citation patterns, although the number of journals involved has increased slightly over time. A few journals are mainly responsible for the cross-disciplinary citing, and they are primarily information science journals citing communication journals. The results may be of interest to those studying scholarly communication or bibliometrics, to faculty constructing curricula in either of the disciplines, to communication and information science scholars seeking new areas of research, and to collection development librarians in drawing the boundaries of these disciplines.}

@ARTICLE{mappin1:braam1991,
  author = {Robert R. Braam and Henk F. Moed and Anthony F. J. van Raan},
  year = 1991,
  title = {Mapping of science by combined co-citation and word analysis. {I.} Structural aspects},
  journal = {Journal of the American Society for Information Science},
  volume = 42,
  number = 4,
  pages = {233--251},
  abstract = {The claim that co-citation analysis is a useful tool to map subject-matter specialties of scientific research in a given period, is examined. A method has been developed using quantitative analysis of content-words related to publications in order to: (1) study coherence of research topics within sets of publications citing clusters, i.e., (part of) the current work of a specialty; (2) to study differences in research topics between sets of publications citing different clusters; and (3) to evaluate recall of current work publications concerning the specialties identified by co-citation analysis. Empirical support is found for the claim that co-citation analysis identifies indeed subject-matter specialties. However, different clusters may identify the same specialty, and results are far from complete concerning the identified current work. These results are in accordance with the opinion of some experts in the fields. Low recall of co-citation analysis concerning the current work of specialties is shown to be related to the way in which researchers build their work on earlier publications: the missed publications equally build on very recent earlier work, but are less consensual and/or less attentive in their referencing practice. Evaluation of national research performance using co-citation analysis appears to be biased by this incompleteness.},

@ARTICLE{mappin2:braam1991,
  author = {Robert R. Braam and Henk F. Moed and Anthony F. J. van Raan},
  year = 1991,
  title = {Mapping of science by combined co-citation and word analysis. {II:} Dynamical aspects},
  journal = {Journal of the American Society for Information Science},
  volume = 42,
  number = 4,
  pages = {252-266},
  abstract = {Combined analysis of co-citation relations and words is explored to study time-dependent (dynamical) aspects of scientific activities, as expressed in research publications. This approach, using words originating from publications citing documents in co-citation clusters, offers an additional and complementary possibility to identify and link specialty literature through time, compared to the exclusive use of citations. Analysis of co-citation relations is used to locate and link groups of publications that share a consensus concerning intellectual base literature. Analysis of word-profile similarity is used to identify and link publication groups that belong to the same subject-matter research specialty. Different types of content-words are analyzed, including indexing terms, classification codes, and words from title and abstract of publications. The developed methods and techniques are illustrated using data of a specialty in atomic and molecular physics. For this specialty, it is shown that, over a period of 10 years, continuity in intellectual base was at a lower level than continuity in topics of current research. This finding indicates that a series of interesting new contributions are made in course of time, without vast alteration in general topics of research. However, within this framework, a more detailed analysis based on timeplots of individual cited key-articles and of content-words reveals a change from more rapid succession of new empirical studies to more retrospective, and theoretically oriented studies in later years. },
