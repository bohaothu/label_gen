%%%                        year is a 4-digit number, and abbrev is a
%%%                        3-letter condensation of important title

                 based of Knuth's {\tt WEB}. The philosophy behind both
                 {\bf cweb} and {\tt WEB} is that an experienced
                 programmer, who wants to provide the best possible
                 documentation of his or her software products, needs
                 two things simultaneously: a language for formatting
                 and a language for programming. When both are
                 appropriately combined we obtain a system much more
                 useful than either language separately. {\bf Cweb}
                 combines {\bf C} source with ({\bf di}){\bf troff} (or
                 {\bf nroff}) documentation (whereas {\tt WEB} operates
                 with Pascal and \TeX). The full facilities of {\bf C}
                 and {\bf troff} are available to the user.\par {\bf
                 Cweb} operates effectively with existing Unix text and
                 program development tools, such as {\bf make}, {\bf
                 tbl}, {\bf eqn}. If speed is important, {\bf cweb} has
                 a built-in formatter which is much faster (and less
                 resource consuming) the {\bf troff} for drafting or

                 The main idea was to produce program documentation that
                 was just as interesting and fascinating to read as
                 ordinary literature. Our experience showed an added
                 benefit, namely that the literate programming
                 environment was an active aid in the problem solving
                 process. The simultaneous programming and documentation
                 lead to significantly improved quality of both programs
                 and documentation.",

                 system for literate programming is shown as an example.
                 The approach is based on utilizing a relational
                 database management system as a major component of the
                 prototyped system. An ER query and update interface is
                 described. Such an interface allows an interactive
                 manipulation of ER database schemas. Sample
                 interactions between a user and the system are given.
                 During the process of manipulation of ER diagrams the
                 information needed to generate an equivalent SQL query
                 is accumulated. A hypertext system for literature

                 identifying the different components of the programs,
                 for highlighting the relations that exist between the
                 components, and for explaining the components and the
                 relations. The authors introduce a literate programming
                 system that is based on a hierarchical variation of
                 MacWrite. The system distinguishes code from prose by
                 the fonts that they are written in, uses boxes for
                 abstracting and structuring code, and employs ports for
                 generating different views of the code.",

                 describe the VAMP approach to literate programming.
                 Literate programming identifies a method of
                 documentation which explains to people what a computer
                 is supposed to do. Generally, this means that
                 refinement steps are documented in such a way that
                 modules can be extracted from the documentation files.
                 The tool has been in use since 1982. The experiences
                 are predominantly positive, in spite of the overhead
                 implicit in the methodology. The fact that VAMP is
                 independent of both programming language and formatter

  abstract =     "The philosophy of literate programming was introduced
                 by Donald Knuth while developing the documentation
                 system {\TeX}. His WEB system consists of two
                 processes, WEAVE and TANGLE, that read a specially
                 constructed literate program source file and produce as
                 output a file containing compilable code and a file for
                 input into {\TeX}. WEB uses a batch approach that seems
                 to hinder the development of new literate programs, and
                 it has not been widely used outside its home base. The
                 literate programming environment LIPED, described in
                 this paper, aims to make the development of literature
                 programs easier by being interactive (rather than batch
                 as is WEB) and by providing instant access to a table
                 of contents, a cross-reference table, and the extracted
                 code. Language independence is achieved, and special
                 facilities are made available to cater for modern
                 programming paradigms. The system runs on minimal
                 hardware and interfaces easily to existing compilers
                 and text processors. This paper describes the
                 background and progress of literate programming,
                 compares the available literate programming systems,
                 and provides an overview of LIPED.",

                 their time trying to understand the system they are to
                 modify. This is due partially to the fact that often
                 the only documentation available is the source code
                 itself. The literate programming paradigm provides the
                 incentive and the capability to produce high quality
                 code and documentation simultaneously. The goal is to
                 create `works of literature' which have all the extras
                 (table of contents, cross references, and indexes) to
                 help readers to comprehend the programs quickly and
                 thoroughly. The purpose of this research is to explore
                 the viability of application of the measurements of
                 software complexity and stability of traditionally
                 developed code to literature programs. A literature
                 program, the WEBmeter, was developed to collect some of
                 the well-known metrics, originally defined for
                 conventional software, for literature programs. Other
                 design and stability metrics were manually extracted
                 from the TANGLEd version of the input WEB programs.
                 Some observations about ten programs that were
                 subjected to the metrics/stability analysis are
                 included.",

                 because existing literate programming systems have some
                 undesirable characteristics such as programming
                 language and text processor dependence and a lack of
                 flexible tools for viewing and manipulating the source
                 file. This paper describes the literate programming
                 system AOPS (abstraction-oriented programming system)
                 which addresses both of these problems. AOPS is a
                 programming language and text processor-independent
                 literate programming system. AOPS tools include a
                 hypertext browser, a lister with the ability to select
                 what is presented and what is suppressed, and a filter
                 to extract the program code from the AOPS source file.
                 AOPS introduces the notion of a phantom abstraction
                 which enhances the intelligibility of the literate
                 program and, when used in conjunction with the browser,

                 uninitiated. Part of the reason is the near universal
                 practice of abbreviating M names. To make matters
                 worse, prior to the NEW command, variable names
                 typically lacked mnemonic significance. Older code also
                 had to deal with an awkwardly limited scope of IF, ELSE
                 and FOR. This limitation led to long and complex code
                 lines consisting of many commands. These and other
                 factors too often combined with an undisciplined
                 programming style to produce M code that is difficult

                 automated program explication, or as a form of routine

                 useful for analyzing small code segments, such as a
                 single line or routine. Clearly, improvements are
                 possible, and environment-specific interpretive
                 constructs could be added to the reader's inventory. It
                 remains to be demonstrated whether this tool will prove

                 attempts to maintain consistency among the various
                 design and program documents of a software system.
                 Unfortunately, the majority of the literate programming
                 tools do not have appropriate user interfaces and
                 require the users to learn complicated and cryptic
                 tagging languages. SGML is a metalanguage used to
                 specify markup or tagging languages that can be used to
                 encode the structure of documents. This paper describes
                 how a markup language defined using SGML can be used as
                 the basic method for structuring literate programming
                 documents and can be made independent of the
                 programming language. Furthermore, with SGML and tools
                 to browse and edit SGML documents, literate programs
                 can benefit from WYSIWYG editing and hypertext
                 capabilities and can even include pictures and other
                 graphics. In addition, syntax-directed editors that
                 support SGML can hide the markup tags and thus remove
                 the need to learn a markup language. Text databases
                 that use SGML can also be used to store literate
                 programs. As a result, literate programs can be browsed
                 and queried using complex search expressions, a
                 capability beyond most text editors. For example, the
                 searches can involve combinations of structural and
                 textual information. Because SGML is a popular and
                 emerging standard, we can expect to have more powerful
                 tools to manipulate many different forms of design and
                 program documentation. This paper describes the issues
                 involved in the development of a literate programming

  abstract =     "The assurance argument that a trusted system satisfies
                 its information security requirements mast be
                 convincing, because the argument supports the
                 accreditation decision to allow the computer to process
                 classified information in an operational environment.
                 Assurance is achieved through understanding, but some
                 evidence that supports the assurance argument can be
                 difficult to understand. The paper describes a novel
                 application of a technique, called literate programming
                 (D.E. Knuth, 1984), that significantly improves the
                 readability of the assurance argument while maintaining
                 its consistency with formal specifications that are
                 input to specification and verification systems. We
                 describe an application of this technique to a simple
                 example and discuss the lessons learned from this

                 GMT:\par

                 Mike Swaine, in his ``Programming Paradigms'' column of
                 the current (\#287, July '98) issue of ``Dr. Dobb's
                 Journal'', writes about Ed Ream's LEO system for
                 literate programming. From his description (and the
                 simple example), it looks (to me) like a cross between
                 noweb and ExcoWord. Has anyone heard anything about
                 this?\par

                 Swaine also gives a pretty accurate (as far as it goes)
                 description of LP, describing Ream's technique as
                 ``literate outlining'' (which I think is a really good
                 description of what ExcoWord does). He uses Knuth's
                 (and, I suppose Ream's) ``section'' terminology to
                 refer to what we would call ``chunks'', but he's never
                 very far off base.\par

                 His most significant point, IMO, is\par

                 ...as Ed points out, the programming world has not
                 beaten a path to Knuth's door demanding WEB. Maybe it
                 lacks something. Maybe that something is
                 outlines.\par

                 While there's not doubt that LP is not at all popular
                 (witness the half-truths I had to resort to in order to
                 get students to sign up for a Special Topics LP
                 course), but I can't agree with his (tentative)
                 conclusion. I think the reason programmers stay away
                 from LP is the same reason they never really do
                 top-down design or document their programs thoroughly
                 or use any of the other ``Good Programming Practices'':
                 It looks like it involves more work than just sitting
                 at the terminal and typing in code. We all know that
                 this ``extra'' up-front work saves significant amounts
                 of time later on, but psychologically, this knowledge
                 doesn't generally translate into action. I'm afraid
                 that ``literate outlining'' faces the same
                 psychological hurdle.\par

                 I also find it interesting that, according to Swaine,
                 Ed Ream found traditional LP too unstructured. My
                 (limited) experience with ExcoWord brought me to the
                 conclusion that the outlining structure was too
                 restrictive, particularly under the demands of
                 maintenance, where major reorganization of the code's
                 structure is often necessary. With traditional LP,
                 structural reorganization involves text chunks almost
                 exclusively, with a bit of shuffling of where specific
                 code chunks are used, but very little rewriting of code
                 chunks (and no rewriting at all of leaf-level code
                 chunks). Outlining, on the other hand, seems to me to
                 require much more work to accomplish the same kind of
                 thing (of course, it is certainly possible that I just
                 didn't look hard enough, and didn't find the ``easy''
                 way to do this). And, since I consider LP's primary
                 strength to be in the area of program maintenance, I
                 think this is a serious problem.",

  abstract =     "The source code for computer programs is destined to
                 be read by compilers and consequently its internal
                 structure is heavily constrained. The compiler neither
                 knows nor cares about such things as a program's
                 internal structure, the relationships between its
                 components and their specifications, the way design
                 patterns are instantiated, the best way to explain its
                 algorithms or how it is intended to be used. People
                 do. Literate programming (LP) was invented by Donald
                 Knuth as a way to address such problems. The idea is
                 appealing but LP has not been adopted widely:the lack
                 of good tools, difficulties with object-oriented
                 languages and the limitations of a single psychological
                 order are among the reasons. In this paper we report
                 the development of theme-based literate programming
                 (TBLP). Themes are extremely flexible: they may be
                 aimed at particular reader groups or represent aspects
                 of the program. Features of TBLP include an extended
                 chunk model which accommodates a richer variety of
                 types, an extended connectionmodel which allows chunks
                 to be threaded together into multiple themes, an
                 enhanced processing model which generalises tangling
                 and weaving and a chunk-level version management
                 system. XML is used to represent the web structure and
                 XML-based technologies such as XSLTare used in
                 processing. This provides flexibility and
                 extensibility, allowing users to define new chunk
                 types. An application which implements TBLP is
                 presented and the integration of TBLP with software
                 engineering processes is discussed.",

  abstract =     "It is difficult and challenging to comprehend the
                 internal aspects of a program. The internal aspects are
                 seen as contrasts to end user aspects and interface
                 aspects. Internal program documentation is relevant for
                 almost any kind of software. The internal program
                 documentation represents the original as well as the
                 accumulated understanding of the program, which is very
                 difficult to extract from the source program and its
                 modifications over time. Elucidative programming is a
                 documentation technique that was originally inspired by
                 literate programming. As an important difference
                 between the two, elucidative programming does not call
                 for any reorganization of the source programs, as
                 required by literate programming tools. Elucidative
                 programming provides for mutual navigation in between
                 program source files and sections of the documentation.
                 The navigation takes place in an Internet browser
                 applying a two-framed layout. In this paper we
                 investigate the applicability of elucidative
                 programming in a number of areas related to internal
                 program documentation. It is concluded that elucidative
                 programming can solve a number of concrete problems in
                 the areas of program tutorials, frameworks, and program
                 reviews. In addition we see positive impacts of
                 elucidative programming in the area of programming
                 education.",

                 even literate programming, suffer from the problem of
                 focusing on what the computer will do, not what the
                 user wants it to do. The algorithmic code is primary
                 and any documentation secondary, especially user
                 documentation. Help facilities appear to be added as an
                 almost independent exercise. We can solve this problem
                 by focusing on the user documentation and regarding the
                 algorithmic code as a mere adjunct. The production of
                 an interactive program should start with the user
                 documentation, with the majority of effort spent on
                 developing and refining that documentation and its
                 structure. Developers should add algorithmic code for
                 any program module only after its documentation is
                 complete and all parties have tested and agreed to it.
                 This perspicuous programming approach seeks to produce
                 programs for the user that are as unenigmatic as
                 possible. With a touch of blithely false etymology, we
                 could call this igmatic programming instead. Take your

                 context-free languages, formal semantics, attribute
                 grammars, compilers, algebraic translation, coroutine

                 1046.68003). This sixth volume is devoted to
                 mathematical topics and contains 41 papers written
                 during the last four decades.\par

                 Donald E. Knuth is widely known as a pioneer of the
                 computer science and most of his papers are devoted to
                 this field. However he has solid mathematical
                 background and has published a lot of mathematical
                 papers covering the entire range of discrete
                 mathematics. Let us mention some topics exposed in this
                 collection of papers: combinatorial analysis related to
                 computers (sequences, backtrack, Latin squares,
                 projective planes), notes on mathematical notation,
                 notes on some 17th century mathematical publications,
                 doubly stochastic matrices, Pfaffians (arrays of
                 numbers), relations between matrices, graphs and trees,
                 large numbers (power series raised to the power), floor
                 function, random sequences, finite fields, central
                 groupoids, algebraic approach of Huffman's algorithm,
                 directed graphs, random matroids, permutations,
                 efficient balanced codes, various aspects of partitions
                 (enumeration, identities, etc.), recurrences (linear,
                 minimization, related to trees), cycles in an evolving
                 graph.\par

                 The collection ends with two lengthy papers: ``First
                 Cycles in an Evolving Graph'' (56 pages) (see Zbl
                 0696.05045) and ``The Birth of the Giant Component''
                 (150 pages) devoted to random graph problems (see Zbl
                 0795.05127), initiated by [{\it P. Erd\"os} and {\it A.
                 R\'enyi}, ``On random graphs I''. Publ. Math.
                 (Debrecen) 6, 290--297 (1959; Zbl 0092.15705)]. The
                 papers are self-contained so that a reader with a
                 general mathematical background would be able to
                 understand the content.\par

                 Almost every paper in this book is supplemented with an
                 addendum where the author presents short information
                 about what has happened after the paper was published:
                 further investigations and new results related to the
                 topic of the paper, comments, corrections.",

                 describes an approach for creating self-documenting
                 statistical results. It applies literate programming
                 (Knuth, 1992) and related techniques in a natural
                 fashion to the practice of statistics. In particular,
                 documentation, specification, and descriptions of
                 results are written concurrently with writing and
                 evaluation of statistical programs. We discuss how and
                 where LSP can be integrated into practice and
                 illustrate this with an example derived from an actual
                 statistical consulting project. The approach is
                 simplified through the use of a comprehensive, open
                 source toolset incorporating Noweb, Emacs Speaks
                 Statistics (ESS), Sweave (Ramsey, 1994; Rossini, et al,
                 2002; Leisch, 2002; Ihaka and Gentlemen, 1996). We

                 degree of literacy on the part of the user. Because

                 programming structures are similar in a number of ways

                 computational-electromagnetics (CEM) simulation
                 software makes this task even more difficult and

  abstract =     "he documentation of a program often falls behind the
                 evolution of the program source files. When this
                 happens it may be attractive to shift the documentation
                 mode from updating the documentation to documenting the
                 evolution of the program. This paper describes tools
                 that support the documentation of program evolution.
                 The tools are refinements of the elucidative
                 programming tools, which in turn are inspired from
                 literate programming tools. The version-aware
                 elucidative programming tools are able to process a set
                 of program source files in different versions together
                 with unversioned documentation files. The paper
                 introduces a set of fine grained program evolution
                 steps, which are supported directly by the
                 documentation tools. The automatic discovery of the
                 fine grained program evolution steps makes up a
                 platform for documenting coarse grained and more
                 high-level program evolution steps. It is concluded
                 that our approach can help revitalize older
                 documentation, and that discovery of the fine grained
                 program evolution steps help the programmer in
                 documenting the evolution of the program.",

                 tasks, especially when novices are involved. It also
                 concerns more experienced programmers when complex
                 algorithms need to be carefully explained and
                 documented as part of software development. Good
                 practice suggests that code and documentation be
                 tightly coupled; but there are only a few support tools
                 specifically targeted at novices that require this as
                 an integral part of the programming process. We propose
                 a new tool design with this objective in mind: P-Coder
                 gives a flexible descriptive view of the program via
                 pseudocode notation within a graphical tree-structured
                 model, from which the complete algorithm can be
                 specified to retain the informal description integrated
                 with the final code. Thus the code meets some of the
                 key requirements for realizing a literate program.",

                 called Scratchpad II, it was developed by IBM under the
                 direction of Richard Jenks[1]. The project evolved over
                 a period of 20 years as a research platform for
                 developing new ideas in computational mathematics.
                 ScratchPad also attracted the interest and
                 contributions of a large number of mathematicians and
                 computer scientists outside of IBM. In the 1990s, the
                 Scratchpad project was renamed to Axiom, and sold to
                 the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) in England who
                 marketed it as a commercial system. NAG withdrew Axiom
                 from the market in October 2001 and agreed to release
                 Axiom as free software, under an open source
                 license.\par

                 Tim Daly (a former ScratchPad developer at IBM) setup a
                 pubic open source Axiom project[2] in October 2002 with
                 a primary goal to improve the documentation of Axiom
                 through the extensive use of literate programming[3].
                 The first free open source version of Axiom was
                 released in 2003. Since that time the project has
                 attracted a small but very active group of developers
                 and a growing number of users.\par

                 This exhibit includes a laptop computer running a
                 recent version of Axiom, Internet access (if available)
                 to the Axiom Wiki website[4], and CDs containing Axiom
                 software for free distribution[5].",

                 first class support for literate programming. Literate
                 programming is a philosophy that argues computer
                 programs should be written as literature with human
                 readability and understanding of paramount importance.
                 While the intent of literate programming is to make
                 understanding computer programs simpler, most literate
                 programming systems are quite complex and consist of
                 three different languages corresponding to )1) an
                 implementation language, )2) a documentation language,
                 and (3) a literate programming glue language. In
                 Knuth's original implementation these were Pascal, TeX,
                 and WEB respectively. Antithetical to the goals that
                 literate programming espouses, this three-language
                 paradigm creates a truly challenging environment for
                 new programmers. In this paper we reimagine literate
                 programming as a core programming language feature and
                 describe a novel system for literate programming based
                 on G-expression transformations. We show that Ginger
                 code can be used to naturally represent code, prose,
                 and literate connections, which in turn unifies,
                 simplifies and significantly extends the literate
                 programming experience.",
