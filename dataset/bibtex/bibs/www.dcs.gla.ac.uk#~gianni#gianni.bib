   abstract =  {With the development and diffusion of the Internet worldwide 
                connection, a large amount of information can be delivered to the 
                users. To avoid their being overflowed by the incoming data, 
                methods of information filtering are required. Thus, there is the 
                problem of determining what information is relevant to the user 
                and how this decision can be taken by a supporting system. 
                Parametric and qualitative descriptors of user's interest must be 
                generated. This paper presents two approaches. The first concerns 
                an information filtering system based on an adaptation of the 
                generalized probabilistic model of information retrieval. The 
                user profile is a vector of weighted terms which are learned from 
                the relevance assessment values given by the user on the training 
                set. Positive terms are considered relevant to the informative 
                need of the user, negative ones irrelevant. The relevance values 
                are interpreted as subjective probabilities and hence are mapped 
                into the real interval [0; 1]. ProFile is a filtering system for 
                the netnews which uses this model with a scale of 11 predefined 
                values of relevance. ProFile allows the user to update on-line 
                his profile and to check the discrepancy between his assessment 
                and the prediction of relevance of the system. The second 
                concerns the InfoAgent, a system for supporting users in 
                retrieving data in distributed and heterogeneous archives and 
                repositories. The architecture is based on the metaphor of the 
                software agents and incorporates innovative hints from other 
                fields: distributed architectures, relevance feedback and active 
                interfaces. The system has a cooperative and supportive role: it 
                understands the user's needs and learns from his behavior. Its 
                aim is to disengage the user from learning complex tools and from 
                performing tedious and repetitive actions.},

   abstract = {We present a class of normal modal calculi $P_FD$, whose syntax 
               is endowed with operators $M_r$ (and their dual ones, $L_r$), one 
               for each $r\in [0,1]$: if $a$ is a sentence, $M_r a$ is to be 
               read ``the probability that $a$ is true is strictly greater than 
               $r$'' and to be evaluated as true or false in every world of a 
               $F$-restricted probabilistic kripkean model. Every such a model 
               is a kripkean model, enriched by a family of regular probability 
               evaluations with range in a fixed finite subset $F$ of $[0,1]$: 
               there is one such a function for every world $w$, $PF(w,-)$, and 
               this allows to evaluate $M_r a$ as true in the world $w$ iff 
               $PF(w,a)>r$. In particular, $M_0 a$ as true in the world $w$ iff 
               $PF(w,a)>0$ iff $a$ is possible in $w$ with respect to the 
               underlying kripkean model. For every fixed $F$ as before, 
               suitable axioms and rules are displayed, so that the resulting 
               system $P_FD$is complete and compact with respect to the class of 
               all the $F$-restricted probabilistic kripkean models.},
