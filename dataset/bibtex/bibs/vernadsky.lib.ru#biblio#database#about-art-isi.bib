	  the beginning of the 20th century (K. Tsyolkovsky, V. Vernadsky, K.
	  Timiryazev, 1. Pavlov), whose scientific work is characterized by a
	  combination of the valuable contribution to a specific field of
	  science and deep philosophical conceptualizations. Ukhtomsky
	  enriched modern neurophysiology by the ideas on dominant - a stable
	  focus of enhanced excitability, determining the organism reactions
	  to the environmental stimuli. Unlike artificial experimental
	  models, natural dominant - vector of the goal-directed behaviour -
	  represents the needs of immediate satisfaction, dominating at the
	  present moment. Formation of needs hierarchy, characteristic of the
	  given personality, occurs during the process of people
	  communication. Namely, another man serves to the subject a mirror,
	  looking into which he realizes himself as a human being (K. Marx).
	  By his teaching on the dominant, Ukhtomsky has revealed the dual
	  nature of the personality's selfconsciousness in the process of its
	  perception of the surrounding people. He showed that involuntary
	  projection of its dominating vital and social needs (motives,
	  intentions) to the image of another man makes the latter only the
	  \textless \textless double\textgreater \textgreater  of the
	  observer, which does not promote the development and enrichment of

	  sincere interest in him, what makes another person a \textless
	  \textless well-deserved collocutor\textgreater \textgreater , a

	  Ukhtomsky on the nature of human \textless \textless
	  Self\textgreater \textgreater  are close to ideological searchings
	  of L. Tolstoy and F. Dostoevsky. They predicted the views of
	  representatives of modern social psychology (E. Fromm, A. Maslow,
	  G. Allport) and formed an integral part, of humanist world outlook
	  of the end of the 20th century.

	abstract    = {Conflicts between man and his environment have
	  increased considerably both in frequency and intensity in the last
	  years. The two prominent scientists, Teilhard de Chardin and V. I.
	  Vernadskij have seen the only chance for saving mankind in the
	  evolution of noosphere, the sphere of reason. When confronting this
	  aim with present results of man's activities in biosphere - e.g.
	  the glasshouse effect, destruction of ozonosphere, presence of
	  pesticides everywhere etc., this theory seems to be very risky. An
	  other theory of this kind is that of Gaia by Lovelock. It assumes a
	  high autoregulation capacity of the biosphere. The question,
	  however, remains as to the limits of this capacity towards the
	  mankind activity. It is stressed by environmentalists nowadays that
	  the recent anthropocentric philosophy should be abandoned and we
	  should pass to a biocentric one. It seems very reasonable even if
	  it is hardly possible to apply it in every day life in detail. In
	  order to understand the interrelations between man and his
	  environment better, we should take in account their development in
	  the past. There are many notions and theories concerning the cours
	  of the hominization process, the ecological aspects, however, have
	  not been respected in them sufficiently. One of the basic
	  principles of ecology shows that no organism can exist without its
	  environment, the evolution of both having passed necessarily in
	  close interconnection (cf. e.g. Novak, V. 1989). Most organisms are
	  more or less passive towards their environment, their tendency
	  being rather to adapt themselves to their life conditions than to
	  change them. It is only the man who has commenced to adapt various
	  objects of his environment like stones, bones, twigs etc. and
	  change them into tools for his protection against wild beasts and
	  for various working needs. It has been shown by Chiarelli (1987)
	  that young mice develop a bigger brain when raised in optimum
	  conditions in comparison with mice in less suitable conditions.
	  Similarly man, when adapting his environment for his benefit, has
	  created better conditions for his progeny and thus contributed to
	  the improvement of its central nervous system. Man with improved
	  brain could better use his intelect in improving his tools and his
	  environment. So originated a typical positive feedback between man
	  and his environment. The evolution of the modem man was accelerated
	  especially by the neolithic agrarian revolution. Storing crops and
	  raising cattle prevented hunger in bad seasons so that children
	  were not limited regularly in their physical and mental
	  development. Man's evolution was so accelerated that there was not
	  sufficient time for natural selection and genetic fixing of the
	  acquired abilities. Our children start their life as animals and
	  the last stage of their development into human beings depends on
	  their family and society. Their education consists in the
	  recapitulation of the evolution from the quadruped to the erect
	  bipedal locomotion, the development of the articulate speach etc.
	  which took thousends years in the past is absolved in a few years
	  in the ontogeny. The unfortunate ''wolf children'', whose early
	  development took place in a wolf's den could never be adapted to
	  human way of life. So the interrelations between man, his
	  environment and human society have been and are far more important
	  than it was hitherto supposed.

	  actually normative in Russian literature and they are often cited
	  only to confirm one or other point of view, sometimes essentially
	  different. Despite Vernadsky's claim that he tries to be
	  independent of philosophy, he as every scientist is not free of
	  some hidden beliefs. Accepting one mode of reasoning, e.g. the line
	  of Goethe and A. Humboldt, he can't admit another, e.g. that
	  emphasizing the meaning of stochasticity. On author's opinion
	  Vernadsky despite all his respect for Darwin and Wallace considered
	  the theory of natural selection simply as general evolutionary
	  theory and didn't appreciate the population thinking which is the
	  core of the concept. Vernadsky underestimates he variety of spatial
	  scales in which real organisms are living. The image of Biosphere
	  given by Vernadsky possesses some features of organism s. str.,
	  e.g. wholeness, deterministic development and functional
	  organization. The model of Gaia proposed by James Lovelock fifty
	  years later in some respects resembles the concept of Vernadsky but
	  certainly there are some differences because of new knowledge
	  accumulated in this period.

It has been argued that existing perspectives on the environmental crisis
can be divided into two broad categories (deep and shallow). Deep ecologists
have used this typology to argue that mainstream perspectives on the
environment are shallow and overly preoccupied with pollution control and
resource degradation. This paper argues that the deep/shallow typology is
biased and misleading because it: (1) obscures the fact that shallow ecology
is comprised of several internally differentiated and disparate perspectives
and (2) it favors the deep ecology perspective by creating the impression
that the human-centered nature of the shallow perspective is incompatible
with the fundamental changes required to address the environmental crisis.
In order to test these claims, we compared deep and shallow perspectives on
the environmental crisis using the North American expression of deep ecology
and the Brundtland version of sustainable development and steady-state
economy as exemplars. From this we were able to make the following
conclusions: (1) deep and shallow ecology perspectives are best visualized
as part of a continuum of perspectives on the environment that emerged from
a long-standing critique of Western development, (2) that the descriptions
of the etiology of the environmental crisis offered by sustainable
development and deep ecology are incomplete, and (3) although both
traditions are presently regarded to be in direct opposition, they have much
to learn from each other.},

	  the environment (or Earth as a whole) have been treated for almost
	  a century. Geophysiology and Parahistology (PH) are terms slowly
	  replacing older scientific thoughts jointly with an increasing
	  number of modifications and alterations of the Darwinian Evolution
	  (DE) concept. Somehow Geophysiology and Parahistology seem to
	  describe evolution in a non-Darwinian domain. According to V. I.
	  VERNADSKY (1929, 1930, 1988)-the great Russian naturalist and
	  biogeochemist-the biogeochemical processes on Earth are controlled
	  by the force of living matter rather than by species associations
	  developing in and with individual ecosystems as expressed by
	  darwinian evolutionary terms. He also claimed that GOETHE was
	  incorrectly regarded as a predecessor of DE by some authors
	  (including DARWIN) and that ''Natur'' (nature) and ''Lebendige
	  Natur'' (the totality of creatures) are two very different things
	  for GOETHE. Detailed analyses of microbial mat systems in the
	  German Wadden Sea and in artificial hypersaline WINOGRADSKY columns
	  have shown that the totality of creatures and matter around them
	  i.e., the ''lebendige Natur'' sensu GOETHE or ''living matter''
	  sensu VERNADSKY Of such environments control to a considerable
	  extent the structure, stability, and (geo-)morphology of sediments
	  and thereby the geological structure of the living Earth. These
	  structures do not follow the rules of sedimentation formulated by
	  the laws of STOKES They represent growth structures (Aufwuchs),
	  whose physics and dynamics are controlled by complex fractal
	  systems. The factors controlling the ultimate shape and
	  stabilisation potential of the eventually resulting rocks and
	  fossils are comparable to tissue development in macroorganisms.
	  Also, certain microbial associations in the sub-recent and in the
	  fossil record may be compared to metazoan tissues. Chemical
	  gradients in the sedimentary column, regulated by the interplay of
	  living matter and sluggish (slowreactive to non-reactive)
	  compounds, combine to create a pattern of porosity and structure of
	  the resulting deposits that clearly indicates microbial influences
	  and especially those of extracellular polymeric substances on the
	  morphology and texture. The combined effects of microbiota or
	  living matter on the sedimentary record are described as
	  parahistology of sediments in analogy of the histology of tissue on
	  a geological scale. This conceptual living tissue made up of
	  microbially generated rocks and ore deposits cycled through
	  metabolic processes and forced into tissue-like structures by
	  microbial biofilms and mats may extend down to the upper mantle of
	  Earth and far up into the stratosphere when Earth is regarded as a
	  living entity over geological periods. We may have to conceive
	  Earth as a living specimen, which is breathing at a frequency of
	  thousands of years instead of the normal physiological breathing
	  rate of man or an insect.
	  Macroorganisms in all terrestrial systems represent the transport
	  and logistic media, which, however, utterly depend on myriads ui
	  intra-, inter-, and extracellular microbial symbiotic partners.
	  Geophysiology - as a new scientific view of life process controlled
	  biogeomorphogenetic and biogeochemical cycles - is presented in the
	  context of a life field theory suggested by KRUMBEIN (1983) and an
	  evolutionary field theory suggested by CRAMER (1989). The latter
	  theories are related to physiological thoughts of FRIEDRICH II. VON
	  HOHENSTAUFEN and to the ''microgeology'' of C. G. EHRENBERG
	  (EHRENBERG, 1854; KANTOROWICZ, 1992; MASSON, 1993). The factors
	  controlling the preservation of organic material and biogenic
	  structures in rocks are discussed on the background of ''climate
	  change'' and ''global change'' theories. Geophysiology and
	  parahistology are introduced as new terms in a time where
	  environment-organism relationships are increasingly studied on a
	  global scale including physiological time scales by far exceeding
	  individual darwinian organismal life times.

which international environmental treaties were formed during the period
1870-1990. Two organizational changes also played a role in the

	abstract    = {This second paper in the series on Ecosystems Emerging
	  treats some properties of ecosystems derivable from the single
	  elementary principle of conservation. These go beyond the mere
	  balancing out of the matter and forces of nature. A brief sketch of
	  a conservationless world is given, followed by an elementary
	  background review of energy, matter and information. The main
	  conservative quantities are matter, energy, momentum and electric
	  charge. The difference between sun and earth surface temperatures
	  is the source of useful energy (exergy) and information to motivate
	  matter. The earth acts as a photon multiplier in this process, and
	  generates entropy radiated to the universe at large. Neither
	  exergy, information, nor photons are conservative quantities. Four
	  phases of matter are recognized: solid, liquid, gaseous and living.
	  These contribute to five realms of the earth's ecosphere:
	  lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrophere, biosphere and noosphere, An
	  additional category, the semiosphere, represents informational
	  aspects of the materialistic ecosphere. Information is related to
	  Aristotle's four causes: formal, material, efficient and final.
	  Information has a material basis; its physical carriers are
	  conservative markers, or avatars. Information is always produced by
	  bonding of masses to form higher-level systems; the energy to
	  achieve bonding is released in degraded form (heat) and carried
	  away by low-energy photons in entropy production, All systems owe
	  their cohesion to bonding (interaction). System bonding may be by
	  conservative substance exchange (transactions) or nonconservative
	  information exchange (relations). In both cases, identity
	  constraints of coupling mediate the bonds. A universal metamodel
	  for system change is described under state-space determinism,
	  Exogenous conditions (inputs), and endogenous conditions (states)
	  are lawfully mapped into behavioral dynamics (outputs). There are
	  two fundamentally different kinds of state-space systems: objects
	  (nonliving, which respond reactively to physical inputs); and
	  subjects (living, which can respond preactively based on phenomenal
	  inputs, which are models of physical inputs). The ability to make
	  models is conjectured as a new definition of life. In living
	  processes, elements of the materialistic ecosphere and
	  informational semiosphere are combined to produce the phenomenal
	  noosphere. All three categories are mutually implicative. Arguments
	  are made to consider space as locally conserved and time as
	  conserved. The nature of transactional (materialistic) and
	  relational (informational) bonding in the origin of systems, under
	  state-space determinism, is described. The conservation principle
	  underlies this because transactions are always the prior basis of
	  relations. Environments arise under the same considerations as
	  origin of systems; conservation is at the root. Input environment,
	  output environment and indirect environment are described as
	  elements of a general concept of environment. Indirect environments
	  are bounded by the speed of light, and (closer in) by the
	  boundaries of defined systems. The within-system portions of
	  component-level environments are environs. Energy balance and
	  photon multiplication in the ecosphere are described as a series of
	  electromagnetic cascades. Charge-discharge cycles of energy and
	  matter are mechanisms for progressively degrading solar photons to
	  heat in coupled solar --\textgreater	trophic --\textgreater
	  biochemical interactions at different scales of hierarchical
	  organization. The conservation principle underlies all these
	  processes. A review of the broad phenomena, concepts and principles
	  of ecology reveals that many of these have strong dependence on
	  conservation of mass, energy, momentum and electric charge, as well
	  as local space and time. Just as conservation laws are basic in the
	  organization of reality, they are also rightly reflected in much of
	  the subject matter of ecology.

	abstract    = {This review considers the Russian scientific
	  literature on the influence of weak static and of low-frequency
	  alternating magnetic fields on biological systems. The review
	  covers the most interesting works and the main lines of
	  investigation during the period 1900 to the present. Shown here are
	  the historical roots, beginning with the ideas of V. Vernadsky and
	  A. Chizhevsky, which led in the field of Russian biology to an
	  increasing interest in magnetic fields, based on an intimate
	  connection between solar activity and life on the Earth, and which
	  determined the peculiar development of Russian magnetobiology. The
	  variety of studies on the effects of magnetic storms and extremely
	  low-frequency, periodic variations of the geomagnetic field on
	  human beings and animals as well as on social phenomena are
	  described. The diverse experiments involving artificial laboratory
	  magnetic fields acting on different biological entities under
	  different conditions are also considered. A series of theoretical
	  advances are reviewed that have paved the way for a step-bystep
	  understanding of the mechanisms of magnetic field effects on
	  biological systems. The predominantly unfavorable influence of
	  magnetic fields on living beings is shown, but the cases of
	  favorable influence of magnetic fields on human beings and lower
	  animals are demonstrated as well. The majority of Russian
	  investigations in this area of science has been unknown among the
	  non-Russian speaking audience for many reasons, primarily because
	  of a language barrier. Therefore, it is hoped that this review may
	  be of interest to the international scientific community.
