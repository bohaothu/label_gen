 ** RAINBOW BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE **
 
I do not consider that every alternative or New Age publication would be
appropriate here.  I have included books about Rainbow Family, per se, about
the broader Rainbow vision, and about the mythology and science of the
rainbow.  I would also like to include ones by prominent Rainbow Family
elders, such as those by Medicine Story and Barry Plunker, but do not as of
this writing have access to them.  (Please email that information to ME
>mendicott@igc.apc.org<, if you have it available.)  [For purposes of this
writing, Rainbow Family refers to those who self-identify as such.]  Also,
there are at least two books in preparation, one by Chuck Will and another by
Barry, the family historian.  (Please email ME any further information about
these people or their projects.)

[from APPENDIX - A. WILLIAM WILLOYA by Vinson Brown, page 81] 
> 
>     Another reason why Willy can be of such help is because he still has a 
>lot of the old Indian Spirit, the spirit that comes from living in the 
>wilderness, from living close to nature.  There is a great power in this 
>spirit, a power about which the white men know little. 
> 
  
>                           B. THE PEYOTE RELIGION 
> 
>     The Peyote Religion, which also is called The Native American Church, is
>an example of the need of the Indian to understand religion in his own way.  
>Members of this religious movement believe in Jesus and the Bible as coming 
>from God, but also believe that God sent the Indians the Peyote Woman, who 
>brought to them the peyote drug, used in their ceremonies.  This drug, when 
>taken properly, with prayer, meditation and singing, brings visions to the 
>Indians who use it, and they say gives them directions and warnings from God. 
>The peyote button is taken from a cactus plant found in Mexico and the 
>southwestern United States.  It is chewed, but has a bitter taste.  The 
>peyote ceremony is generally held in a tipi, with a circle of Indians inside,
>led by the Peyote Chief.  A half moon of ashes, a drum and various other 
>ceremonial helpers (some of which are shown in our color plate) are used.  
>The ceremony usually lasts all night, with considerable singing and drum 
>beating. 
>     The visions of those who take peyote are often very strange and 
>beautiful, as shown in our color plate.  Colors of most brilliant shades may 
>appear and usually pulsate, probably in tune with the beat of the Peyote 
>Drummer.  The fantastic experience gives evidence of transforming and 
>improving character when tied in with religion, but there seems to us to be 
>some danger that Indians and others who uses peyote might come to depend on 
>the drug too much, and not enough on their own efforts.  The purification of 
>the hearts of men requires hard work and anything that helps this is good, 
>but should not be depended upon alone.  Certainly peyote should be used with 
>great care, particularly as there is evidence it may be harmful to some 
>people, and not used at all where it is against the law. 
>     There is considerable controversy over whether the drug compounds found 
>in peyote are harmful or not, though most authorities are agreed that they 
>are not habit-forming.  use of the drug even in religious ceremonies is 
>banned in some states, but in Arizona recently the State Supreme Court 
>declared the law an unconstitutional infringement of religious freedom.  
>Followers of Peyote teach the leading of a life of purity.  In fostering 
>ceremonies that use some of the old Indian ideas of religion, they probably 
>help preserve and rebuild some of the wonderful old Indian spirit that the 
>Indians were losing.  Some of the Peyote dreams have been of a time coming 
                       ==================================================== 
>when all peoples would be united in brotherhood.  If true, then Peyote itself
 =============================================================================
>is a step in this direction, and the followers of this religious movement are
 =============================================================================
>being made ready for something bigger and wider that will bring all peoples 
 =========================================================================== 
>together in love and harmony. 
 ============================= 
  
>ABOUT THIS BOOK AND ITS AUTHORS 
> 
>     An Indian who read this book said: "It makes me feel strange.  It makes 
>me proud of my people, but ashamed of my own life and wanting to improve it." 
>A white man who read it said: "I never knew the Indians had such feeling; I 
>never knew they had such strange and wonderful visions.  That they tie all 
>together into a meaningful pattern makes me think there is something behind 
>them."  Whether you are white, Indian or of any other race, you will find in 
>this book a new an exciting way to look at life and a promise of glory and 
>peace for all mankind. 
>     The Oglala Sioux beaded bag shown in the upper right is a unique key to 
>this story, for somehow it started one of the remarkable visions told about 
>in this book and it started an unusual partnership of an Eskimo and a white 
>biologist in writing it. 
>     The Eskimo, William Willoya, was born and educated in Alaska, but has 
>traveled in Europe and over much of North America, searching for the 
>fulfillment of a wondrous dream.  How he found it is part of the story. 
>     Vinson Brown, author of eighteen published books, has his M.A. in 
>biology from Stanford University and also minored in Anthropology at the 
>University of California.  he has traveled in Asia, Central America, and over
>much of western North America, visiting many Indian tribes and studying their
>thoughts, dreams and customs with understanding and love.

[from the Prologue, pages 4-5] 
> 
>     The various stories in this book are, in fact, one.  Together they tell 
>a saga that is larger than the sum of their collective parts.  The thread 
>that links them is the Legend of the Rainbow Warriors, part of the emerging 
>myth of a New Age.  In brief, the Legend of the Rainbow Warriors says that 
>when the Earth becomes desperately sick through the doings of human beings, 
>some of the people will recognize that they are steadily destroying 
>themselves and their Earth Mother.  With spiritual support, the Rainbow 
>Warriors - people of all colors and faiths - will come to the rescue, 
>eventually establishing a long and joyous reign of peace. 
>     This modern myth suggests there will be no one hero in this time, no 
>George Washington or Joan of Arc to rescue us from the great dilemma we have 
>created.  We must do it ourselves.  In that sense, the Legend of the Rainbow 
>Warriors is, to use a modern term, a holistic myth, wherein we all have both 
>the opportunity and the responsibility to become spiritually awakened heroes.
>     The overall myth points out the general direction that we need to 
>travel: a direction in which there is full respect for the self, for others, 
>and for all the creations who share life upon the planet.  By proceeding in 
>this direction, we will create a spiritually informed culture that uses 
>scientific technology to maintain freedom and enhance the balance of life.  
>From that perspective, this book is a journalist's dispatch on how the myth 
>of a New Age is unfolding in the world. 
> 
  
[from the Epilogue, pages 135-136] 
> 
>     While I will venture no bold claim of ultimate truth for the conclusions
>suggested in this book, I will say this: they are part of my truth.  I offer 
>the legend of the Rainbow Warriors in the hope that it will raise helpful 
>questions for you, the reader: What is your myth?  What gives your life 
>meaning?  How are you acting to make your myth a living part of the world's 
>experience?  If the Legend of the Rainbow Warriors speaks to you, what can 
>you do to make this myth real, to engage more directly in the ancient quest 
>of heroes and heroines: bringing heaven to Earth?

Rainbow Bridge
 
The strength of shared vision will make our world over in light.  Take the
Rainbow Prophesy, copy it three times over, (a quality copy machine will
guarantee maintaining clarity of print and message), keep one for yourself,
and then mail a copy to three people anywhere on the planet.  Then let them be
guided by their hearts to do the same until all planetary citizens are brought
to light in the Rainbow Dream, so that we may dream and work together for true
peace.
 
Love,
Thunder Woman
 
 
Prophesies of Intertribal Societies of the Native American Indians
 
[Transcribed from a tape of a lecture given by Harley Swiftdeer in April 1983.
 
Introduction by Aleran.]
 
Throughout the ages humanity has sought out the prophesies of the spiritually
gifted to instill a clear hope and vision into life.  During this time many
prophesies come to us trying to lead us in many different directions.  Some
prophesy points to disaster, hopelessness, and the annihilation of mankind. 
But other prophesies create a vision of joyful transformation through quantum
leaps into love and light.
 
We are dreamers and we create physical reality through the thought-forms we
hold.  As things stand now, the human race is dreaming a hell.  But as
individuals and as a collective humanity it is our potential to dream of
paradise and to create the kingdom of heaven on our Mother Earth.
 
Could it be that the pain in our hearts caused by the hell we have created
will spur us on into visions and creations of a world formed in love?  It is
my prayer and dream, along with a multitude of others who have taught me to
dream the Rainbow dream, that each and everyone of you learn to dream both
while awake and sleeping, the dream of unity and love through divine
transformation.
 
This prophesy on the following pages is a dream and vision that is a potential
reality for mankind.  It is not an ultimatum.  But it is ours to behold and to
create if we only dare to dream it together.

The Prophesy
 
These prophesies cannot be traced to any specific tribe for they came from
intertribal Medicine Societies.
 
The Medicine Societies involved in channeling the prophesies are the women's
societies of the Crystal Skull and the Black Widow.
 
 
1980
 
The year of the creation of the teachings of the Eight Great Powers and the
introduction, and the giving back to humanity of the Twenty Count.  The
Starmaiden Circle and Flowering Tree Teachings which began the evolution of
the distribution of the wheels and keys (the esoteric teachings of the North
American Indians) of Turtle Island.  It was in that year that the major
beginning wheels and keys were given away.
 
 
1981
 
The year of the planting of the light seeds of the Hokseda (the higher self). 
Many teachers of the Eight Great Powers began to plant their seeds of light
about the development of the higher self and began to open the teachings to
the Rainbow People also known as Meti (mixed blood - the Rainbow People).
 
 
1982
 
The year of fertilization, the year of planting, the year of going within
these seeds of light in order to see the potentiality, the road map that a
person can use.  In the Turtle Island lore we say it is the year of finding
one's path with heart and many many have done this.
 
 
1983
 
The year of fruition, the year of seeking perfection, growth and development. 
Most importantly this is the year of trust and innocence as being totally
open, when people are listening and teachers are talking to teachers.  When
mythologies of the world and all Eight Great Powers are finally revealing
secrets and the teachings within the mythologies are brought out into the
open.  Because of this there was a great deal of joy amongst teachers.
 
 
1984
 
This year is critical.  The year of the animal.  The year of Tuwalananie, the
dark force.  The reason for this is that for three years seeds of light have
been planted and we are starting to grow and the teachings are starting to
come out and all those ones inside each of the Eight Great Powers who have
taught deliberate lies in myth, who have used the power of wheels to gain
control of people to gain followers, to gain disciples, to gain devotees, are
going to be very threatened by the awakening of the consciousness of the
RAINBOW PEOPLE because the Rainbow People exist in every country, in every
nation, in every land.  In other words the Sun Dancers are going to be strong
enough.  The dark forces will be extremely threatened and they will use their
power and their power exists in technology.  We are going to see some of the
most strong technological advances known to humanity occurring this year and
these very technological advances are going to be a tremendous threat as well
as a blessing to the survival of humanity.  Now, what is also a Heyoka
(trickster) is that 1984 is also the year that we must establish balance and
harmony between the light and the dark forces.  It's going to be interesting
and that's why we have this sense of urgency because it is getting short.
 
Grace Walking Stick is the head seer and visionary of the Black Widow Society.
 
She said that there will be a major crisis to put us on the brink of nuclear
war and the only thing that will stop it - is that the dark force is trying to
create an artificial sun - nuclear war - that we must exert the influence, the
SUN DANCERS, the RAINBOW PEOPLE, by smoking our pipes, of gathering together
and of sharing our medicine for solar power, for world peace, and whatever
else happens we MUST not give energy in protesting or being against something
because if you take the amount of energy you spend marching, talking, writing
letters against things and instead put an equal amount or double amount of
energy with what you are for, we can change it.  Example: INSTEAD OF
PROTESTING URANIUM, PROMOTE SOLAR.
 
 
1985
 
The year of human to human communication.  The year when the human family
finally becomes a human if we get through 1984.  [This booklet is being
produced in May 1985 - HOORAY!!!  We made it!!!]  Then there will be more
teachers and more teachings brought out to open format than has ever been seen
on this planet in the first fifty thousand years.  Because then we will re-
establish contact in a very knowledgeable way with our ancestors from the
stars.  So mark that down because it will happen.  The first wave will come
from Pleiades and will be totally acknowledged and will be known to all the
world powers.  The second wave will come from Sirius.
 
Ruby Morning Star was the head seer of the Crystal Skull Society.  She said
that in 1985 you will see a total change in the concept of what we call the
United Nations.  Instead of political opposition and struggle it will change
names and become the new circle of law - the Eight Great Powers.
 
 
1986
 
When Tagashala and the enlightened teachers begin to open the veil of the
crack between the worlds.  We will see our memory circles.  All kivas and
sacred power spots will come alive in 1986 and be totally awakened.  The inner
room of the Great Pyramid will be opened.  The order of the Golden Dawn will
have ceremonies there again for the first time in 20,000 years.  The Temple of
the Sun in Palenque will be refurbished, reawakened and ceremonies will begin
again.  The old traditional ceremonies that are still applicable for today's
world will be renewed.  Many of the ceremonies that are so-called
traditionalists, but are trying to keep us locked in the past and will not
function today will fall.  It will be hard for some of the people of the
medicine societies because they don't know any other way.
 
They're going to have to change or die.  Many teachers who have been seen as
great teachers, who have literally kept us in the dark as worshippers of the
sacrament orders will physically die and go over because it's the only way
they can find the light in 1986 and many teachers will be seen for what they
were and they will be the farmers, the laborers, and the gas station
attendants and they will be seen as the real teachers because the Tagashala
will be fully awakened.
 
 
1987
 
144,000 Sun Dance enlightened teachers will totally awaken in their dream
mindbodies.  They will begin to meet in their own feathered serpent or winged
serpent wheels and become a major force of the light to help the rest of
humanity to dance their dream awake.  A Sun Dance teacher is any human being
who has awakened, who has balanced their shields, who has gained the dream
mindbody and who honors all paths, all teachers, and all ways, I look for the
day when I can sit down with my pipe and the Buddhists with theirs.  You will
see me sit down with my dagger and my Sufi drum, with my sword, my Shinto way,
and my pipe, my Indian way.  We're going to put our Soul out on the table and
say "I love you all."  This is a sacred dance.  That's what 1987 is about. 
That's a Sun Dancer.
 
You cannot say that you have the only true way, for all ways are true.  In
1987, 144,000 enlightened souls will sit down in gathering together circles
saying "here it is Brothers and Sisters.  Openly, totally - Come and receive
it."  A lot of these are going to be so-called common people and not the
teachers you see up there now.  On August 17, 1987 the various winged serpent
wheels will begin to turn, to dance once again and when they do the RAINBOW
LIGHTS will be seen in dreams all over the world and Those Rainbow Light
dreams will help awaken the rest of humanity.
 
 
1988
 
We will sit in a new circle of law.  Civil and social law will tumble.  All
civil and social laws by whatever governments will have to be in conformity
with natural laws or the people will not accept them and they will have the
enlightenment necessary to reject the laws.  Science will once again become
metaphysics, will once again become magic.  They will discover four laws that
will help them jump from natural to magical law and transcend the time/space
continuum which is the limitation of the age and once again we will begin to
take our power and to work with rules and laws that are magical laws and
cosmic laws.
 
 
1989
 
We will once again see the way to continue a new dream.  We will be given the
road map back to the stars and we will see the star people come out of the
illusion of their two-legged form and into their actual Great Sleeper-Dreamer
form.  And so you will see some very, very powerful, totally enlightened
Masters in 1989 and that's the year of the second coming of the Christ spoken
of in the Book of Revelations and it will be the awakening of a new circle, a
new design of energy movement for humanity.  Christ means a circle.  So the
second coming of the sacred circle is all enlightened humans dancing as one
consciousness.
 
 
1990
 
A powerful year and it's really hard for me to talk about it.  I am a great
dreamer but I don't know if I dream that large.  We will see a real shift in
planetary consciousness.  Many of the enemies of the humans shall begin to
drop away.  In 1990 you will see the Twelve Sacred Driver Wheels of each of
the Eight Sacred Powers stored and put together to create the figure 8 of
infinity sign.  And 1990 will begin through the Feathered Serpent Medicine
Wheels those groups of seventeen Great Sleeper Dreamers.  The first migration
to the next world will begin, leaving behind on this planet another world of
enlightened humanity to join the many already on other planets throughout our
universe.  When you speak of this migration to other planets, are you speaking
of the creation of a new race?  Another dream, another dance, another series
of dances in another dream in another world.
 
What's the difference between this world and the new creation?  It is those
that go on ahead that are the pathfinders.  There are always the pioneers,
there are always the people that choose to do it the hard way in a sense.  In
other words, they're totally willing to sacrifice and to step out on the path
of total unknown simply because it's a pleasure to make it known.
 
 
1991
 
For those who stay here on Grandmother Earth, they will totally gain the light
of the Great Light Wheel.  That there will be one humanity, one planet
composed of all the different ways of dancing in complete harmony in the great
gathering together circle.  In 1991 all the seeds will be planted.
 
 
1992
 
The earth will have its true reality formed.  It will join the sisterhood of
planets, the Daughters of Copper-woman and it will create within itself all
forms of all things in harmony with the everything.
 
 
1993
 
We will see a whole new way of perfection.  There will be plants on this
Grandmother Earth that will give life and sustenance as never before seen. 
Starvation on the earth - all those things will be gone.
 
 
1994
 
There will be a total balance and harmony.  All beings will be balanced fives
or enlightened fives - a six.  And they will still be in their physical
bodies.
 
 
1995
 
The new race of humans will begin to design their new reality of life on this
planet as they intended it to be when they came from the stars.
 
 
1996
 
The second migration to the new world will occur leaving behind on Grandmother
Earth those who are choosing to continue to hold the power on this planet
within the space of all the Sacred Twelve.  All of these people who choose to
remain after the second migration will begin to establish this planet & use
the collective unconscious to hold the power of this space in harmony with the
Great Circle of Twelve, all the planets, and there is a whole lot I don't even
know.  There is more that I am not supposed to talk about yet.
 
 
1997
 
The dream will be actualized and this planet will hold its space in the great
Council of planets and become part of the Universal enlightened Brotherhood
and Sisterhood of humanity because there is an organization that is inter-
galactic that is known as the Great International Brotherhood and Sisterhood
of Humanity and Keepers of the Light Circles.  It's happened on many planets
and it's expected to happen on a lot of other planets.
 
 
1998
 
There will be a movement in 1998 when population will be the population.  The
Circle of Law will hold the image of fast thought necessary to allow this
planet to become a starship.
(Is this fun?  Not bad for a bunch of ignorant savages.)
 
 
1999
 
The third migration will leave this planet for the other new world and this
planet will now be a starship, a spaceship, have its design of energy movement
guided by all of humanity that's living here because, see, it's been a
starship all along floating around a central sun but not in harmony with
sister planets.
 
 
2000
 
In the year 2000 the Great Spirit will have left its seed and the egg of
everything here on this planet and it will create itself 20 times over at the
speed of light and thus the prophecy ends as I have been given it by the
Grandmothers that I share with you now.
 
 
The Hopi Prophecy
 
This Prophecy does not give specific dates but refers to certain symbolic
events which will have a world-wide influence.
 
The final stage, called the "Great Day of Purification," has also been
described as a "mystery egg," in which the forces of the swastika and the Sun,
plus a third force symbolized by the color red, culminate either in TOTAL
REBIRTH or TOTAL ANNIHILATION - we don't know which yet, but the choice is
ours.  War and natural catastrophe may be involved.  The degree of violence
will be determined by the degree of inequity caused among the peoples of the
world and in the balance of Nature.
 
That it will be very violent is now almost taken for granted among traditional
Hopi, but man may still lessen the violence by correcting his treatment of
Nature and his fellow man.  Ancient spiritually-based communities, such as the
Hopi, must especially be preserved and not forced to abandon their wise way of
life and the natural resources they have vowed to protect.
 
The Hopi play a key role in the survival of the human race, through their
vital communion with the unseen forces that hold Nature in balance, as an
example of a practical alternative to the suicidal man-made system, and as a
fulcrum of world events.  The pattern is simple.  "The whole world will shake
and turn against those who are hindering the Hopi."
 
The man-made system now destroying the Hopi is deeply involved in similar
violations throughout the world.  The devastating reversal predicted in the
Prophecies is part of the natural order.  If those who thrive from that
system, its money and its laws, can manage to stop it from destroying Hopi,
then many may be able to survive the Day of Purification and enter a NEW AGE
of PEACE.  But if no one is left to continue the Hopi Way, then the hope for
such an age is in vain.
 
 
Planetary Round Table Network
 
To bring in and attune to the new harmonic etheric energies birthing the body
of the New Earth.
 
To meet in Circles the first Wednesday each month at 8pm for ONE HOUR'S
SILENCE TO RECEIVE HIGHER GUIDANCE.  Weekly gatherings may be preferred.
 
If planetary cleansing becomes more severe these Round Table circles will be a
major network through which help and guidance will be relayed to others.
 
To dedicate ourselves to the Return of Harmony and Sacredness to all things,
to all people and to the Earth.
 
MICHAEL IRVING of Acorn Publishing offers to travels anywhere where there is
sufficient interest to (1) talk to groups about the Planetary Round Table
Network, and/or (2) give a one day Workshop entitled 'ATTUNEMENT TO THE NEW
EARTH: Self and Planetary Healing.'  Tel. Michael/Heather on U.K. 067 284 200.
