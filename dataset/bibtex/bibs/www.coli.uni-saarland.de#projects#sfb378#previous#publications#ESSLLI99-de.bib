 abstract = {This reader contains material for the ESSLLI '99 course, ``Scope
Underspecification and Processing''. The reader and course are 
aimed at a pretty broad audience; we have tried to only presuppose
a very general idea of natural language processing and of 
first-order logic.
Underspecification is a general approach to dealing with
ambiguity. In the course, we'll be particularly concerned with 
scope underspecification, which deals with scope ambiguity, a 
structural ambiguity of the semantics of a sentence. As scope 
underspecification is at least partially motivated by computational 
issues, we will pay particular attention to processing aspects. 
We're going to show how dominance constraints can be used for 
scope underspecification and how they can be processed 
efficiently by using concurrent constraint programming 
technology.},
