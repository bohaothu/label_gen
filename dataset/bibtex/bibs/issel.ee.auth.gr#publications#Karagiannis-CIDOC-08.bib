  abstract = {The documentation and analysis of Byzantine Art is an important component
	of the overall effort to maintain cultural heritage and contributes
	to learning and comprehending ones history traversal path. Efficient
	publishing of the multi-dimensional and multifaceted information
	that is necessary for the complete documentation of artworks should
	draw on a good organization of the data. Eikonognosia is a research
	project funded by the Greek General Secretariat of Research and Technology
	(GSRT) that aims to efficiently organize and publish detailed information
	about icons in the World Wide Web. Information derived from the analysis
	conducted in the Art Diagnosis Center of Ormylia Foundation is taken
	as a case study. Eikonognosia provides the means for organising detailed
	and multidimensional information about Byzantine icons in a way that
	is compatible to international standards (CIDOC-CRM - ISO 21127:2006)
	and allows for an easy retrieval of data with advanced semantic web
	technologies. The ultimate goal for Eikonognosia is to foster the
	cultural heritage community by providing an integrated framework
	that helps to facilitate organization, retrieval and presentation
	of data from the cultural heritage domain.},
