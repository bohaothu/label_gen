  abstract = {With the proliferation of ubiquitous computing devices and mobile
	internet it is envisaged that future pervasive services will be increasingly
	large-scale and operate at an inter-organizational level. Therefore,
	designing and implementing pervasive services will be a more complex
	and challenging task. Building software architectural models of concurrent
	and distributed pervasive services and their compositions provide
	engineers a better understanding of how these complex services inter-operate
	and help uncover any errors during the early stages of the software
	lifecycle. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on behavioral
	modeling and analysis techniques for representing pervasive software
	services and verifying process behavior of these models against specified
	system properties. As part of ongoing research, we model the crosscutting
	context-dependent behavior of our services as aspect-oriented models
	using a custom Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile, and apply
	model transformation techniques to automatically translate the aspects
	into state machine based behavioral representations to facilitate
	rigorous software process analysis. The approach is explored using
	an existing case study in transport and logistics.},

  abstract = {Specific features of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), such as autonomy,

	agent-oriented modeling languages have delivered basic MAS design

	proposition of a new domain-specific language, called AGOL. In addition,

	in the development of information technology during these years.
	People have found many programming problems for which the traditional
	object oriented programming (OOP) model and component oriented programming
	(COP) model are not sufficient to clearly capture some of the important
	design decisions the program must implement. This problem is much
	more obvious in pervasive computing environment due to the variety
	of environment. AOP technology has been presented to resolve this
	problem. In this paper, we introduce THAOP, a lightweight and flexible
	aspect oriented programming framework based on TH_CORE (a.k.a. EFL)
	component platform, and compare THAOP to other AOP framework. And
	also a case study is given out to help readers have a much clearer
	visualize about THAOP},

	platforms exist that achieve this to some extent, and that are built
	on general-purpose languages (GPLs). However, these approaches suffer
	from standard difficulties of GPLs relating to the lack of semantic
	expressiveness of their constructs. In this paper, we describe high-level
	declarative constructs that can be used to specify the adaptation
	of application behaviour to specific situations. The language is
	supported by a framework that enables the exchange and merge of behaviours

  abstract = {Pervasive applications must be aware of the contextswhere they are
	executed. These contexts may vary greatlyfrom each other and may
	change quickly. Thus, pervasiveapplications should be highly reconfigurable
	in orderto deal with such context changes. There are twomain problems
	associated with this issue: (1) contextawareness is a crosscutting
	concern that can not be wellencapsulated in a single module using
	traditional technologies, which hinders application design maintenance
	and reusability; and (2) reasoning about application designcorrectness
	can be complex due to the number anddiversity of potential contexts
	where a pervasive application could be executed. In order to overcome
	these problems we propose the use of the Aspect-Oriented Executable
	Modelling (AOEM) UML 2.0 Profile for designing pervasive applications.
	Aspect-Oriented techniques contribute to the encapsulation of crosscutting
	concerns, such as contextawareness, into well-localized modules.
	Executable Modelling helps engineers to reason about application
	design by executing the design models in different contexts and situations.
	Finally, we will discuss how these aspect-oriented models would map
	into a middleware platform that provides built-in services to support
	pervasive applications. Services, such as context-awareness, are
	provided as a set of user-configurable aspects. These ideas are illustrated
	using a location-aware intelligent transportation system consisting
	of a set of cooperating sentient vehicles.},

  note = {ACM: "aspect oriented" and "context aware"},
  abstract = {The navigation of a web application is the possible sequences of web
	pages a user can visit. In the simplest case the next page is determined
	by the current page and the action (e.g. link, button) selected by
	the user. However, many web applications now incorporate adaptive
	navigation, where the next page also depends on the user's mode,
	for example whether they are a customer or an administrator, or depends
	on what pages the user has visited previously.Navigation models are
	useful for clarifying requirements and specifying implementation
	behavior. When a model is formal, it can also be used to generate
	design or implementation artifacts, and can be verified for properties
	such as broken links or length of navigation path. These uses are
	all important for the case of simple navigation, but even more important
	for adaptive navigation because of the added complexity. However,
	none of the current formal approaches can support adaptive navigation.In
	this paper we present an approach that uses Statecharts to formally
	model adaptive navigation, and show how important properties of a
	navigation model are verified using existing model-checking tools.
	We summarize the kinds of properties that can be checked with such
	a model, and describe how to use the Symbolic Model Verifier (SMV)

  abstract = {Handling context is required for applications to dynamically and appropriately

	involves the consideration of a set of concerns related to the handling

	tangled with the base code of the applications, resulting in code
	that is badly modularised and therefore is hard to understand, manage

	kinds of context using aspect-oriented programming techniques. We
	demonstrate that a context-aware application built in this manner
	exhibits improved modularity, with corresponding improvements in

	techniques, and also against a popular context framework, using metrics

  abstract = {Reflective middleware provides an effective way to support adaptation

	complex, certain drawbacks of the reflective middleware approach
	are becoming evident. In particular, reflective APIs are found to
	impose a steep learning curve, and to place too much expressive power
	in the hands of developers. Recently, researchers in the field of
	Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) have argued that 'dynamic aspects'
	show promise in alleviating these drawbacks. In this paper, we report
	on work that attempts to combine the reflective middleware and AOP
	approaches. We build an AOP support layer on top of an underlying
	reflective middleware substrate in such a way that it can be dynamically
	deployed/undeployed where and when required, and imposes no overhead
	when it is not used. Our AOP approach involves aspects that can be
	dynamically (un)weaved across a distributed system on the basis of
	pointcut expressions that are inherently distributed in nature, and
	it supports the composition of advice that is remote from the advised
	joinpoint. An overall goal of the work is to effectively combine
	reflective middleware and AOP in a way that maximises the benefits
	and minimises the drawbacks of each.},

  abstract = {Behavioral reflection is a powerful approach for adapting the behavior
	of running applications. In this paper we present and motivate partial
	behavioral reflection, an approach to more efficient and flexible
	behavioral reflection. We expose the spatial and temporal dimensions
	of such reflection, and propose a model of partial behavioral reflection
	based on the notion of hooksets. In the context of Java, we describe
	a reflective architecture offering appropriate interfaces for static
	and dynamic configuration of partial behavioral reflection at various
	levels, as well as Reflex, an open reflective extension for Java
	implementing this architecture. Reflex is the first extension that
	fully supports partial behavioral reflection in a portable manner,
	and that seamlessly integrates load-time and runtime behavioral reflection.
	The paper shows preliminary benchmarks and examples supporting the
	approach. The examples, dealing with the observer pattern and asynchronous
	communication via transparent futures, also show the interest of
	partial behavioral reflection as a tool for open dynamic Aspect-Oriented
	Programming.},

  abstract = {Many aspect-oriented middleware platforms support run-time aspect
	weaving, but do not support coordinating distributed changes to a
	set of aspects at run-time. A distributed change entails weaving
	or unweaving multiple inter-dependent aspects that are logically
	or physically distributed. Coordinating such multiple weavings inside
	the application layer is a complex and difficult task for the application
	developer, because global state consistency, structural integrity
	and other safety properties have to be preserved. In this paper,
	we present the DyReS framework that offers the required coordination
	support on top of existing aspect-oriented middleware platforms.
	The framework is customizable towards application-specific requirements
	to achieve improved performance and reconfiguration semantics. We
	have validated our approach by delivering and examining two implementations
	of the DyReS framework: one on top of JBoss AOP and a second one
	for Spring AOP.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose an extension to JAsCo for supporting Adaptive
	Programming in a Component-Based Software Development context. JAsCo
	is an aspect-oriented programming language targeted at Component-Based
	Software Development and allows encapsulating crosscutting concerns
	using highly reusable aspect beans. Adaptive Programming on the other
	hand, allows capturing crosscutting concerns by structure-shy adaptive
	visitors. We propose to implement an adaptive visitor as a regular
	JAsCo aspect bean. Hence, the reusability of an adaptive visitor
	is improved because the same visitor can be reused within different
	component contexts. We introduce JAsCo traversal connectors to deploy
	adaptive visitors, implemented as JAsCo aspect beans, upon a concrete
	component traversal. In addition, these traversal connectors allow
	to explicitly specify how the behavior of several adaptive visitors,
	instantiated onto the same component traversal, needs to be combined
	by making use of the JAsCo precedence and combination strategies.
	A prototype implementation of the JAsCo Adaptive Programming extension,
	which employs the DJ library, is available. As a proof of concept,
	we present an extended case study in the context of the Web Service
	Management Layer (WSML) project. In this case study, a set of visitors
	implemented in JAsCo is reused to accomplish multiple tasks.},

	Adaptation rules can provide an efficient way to transform Web contents

	the rule base management becomes a challenge while taking requesters'
	contexts into account. In this paper, we refer requesters' contextual
	requirements (or contexts in short) to the information that may affect
	their perceptions of browsing Web contents, such as requesters' preferences
	and sensations, situated places, as well as devices and network connectivity.
	We have used JESS to design and implement dynamic adaptation strategies
	to guide the transformation process. Adaptation strategies are designed
	to improve rule base efficiency by performing dynamic scheduling
	of rule firing in an agenda. An adaptation strategy is composed of
	selected adaptation rules based on requesters' contexts. When a user's
	context changed, new adaptation strategy will be generated automatically
	by rearranging adaptation rules. By using JESS, we can dramatically
	reduce the number of adaptation rules from 54 to 22. The experiment
	results indicate our adaptation strategy can successfully adapt Web
	contents to satisfy requesters' contexts and obtain superior performance.},
