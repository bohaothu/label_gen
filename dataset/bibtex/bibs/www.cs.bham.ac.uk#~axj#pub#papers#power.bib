  abstract = 	{Much of relational algebra and the underlying
		  principles of relational data\-base design have a
		  simple representation in the
		  theory of domains that is traditionally used in the
		  denotational semantics of programming languages.  By
		  investigating the possible orderings on powerdomains
		  that are well-known in the study of nondeterminism
		  and concurrency it is possible to show that many of
		  the ideas in relational databases apply to
		  structures that are much more general than
		  relations. This also suggests a method of
		  representing database objects as typed objects in
		  programming languages.
 
		  In this paper we show how operations such as {\em
		  natural join} and {\em projection} -- which are
		  fundamental to relational database design -- can be
		  generalized, and we use this generalized framework
		  to give characterizations of several relational
		  database concepts including functional dependencies
		  and universal relations. All of these have a
		  simple-minded semantics in terms of the underlying
		  domains, which can be thought of as domains of
		  partial descriptions of ``real-world'' objects. We
		  also discuss the applicability of relational
		  database theory to non-relational structures such as
		  records with variants, higher-order relations,
		  recursive structures and other ordered spaces.}
