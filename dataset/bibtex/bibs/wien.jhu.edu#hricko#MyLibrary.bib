physics and mathematics pose the question with some force: traditional mathematical
norms discourage speculation, but it is the fabric of theoretical physics. In practice
there can be benefits, but there can also be unpleasant and destructive consequences.
Serious caution is required, and the issue should be considered before, rather than
after, obvious damage occurs. With the hazards carefully in mind, we propose a
framework that should allow a healthy and positive role for speculation.},

We consider the historically influential version of the doctrine, Psychological Individualism, and the many counter-arguments
to it. We then propose and assess various modifications to the doctrine that might allow it to avoid the classical objections.
We call these Psychological Descriptivism, Teleological Cognitive Architecture, and Ideal Cognizers. These characterizations
give some order to the wide range of modern views that are seen as psychologistic because of one or another feature. Although
these can avoid some of the classic objections to psychologism, some still hold.},

	Abstract = {This article reviews research on the use of situation models in language comprehension and memory retrieval over the past 15 years. Situation models are integrated mental representations of a described state of affairs. Significant progress has been made in the scientific understanding of how situation models are involved in language comprehension and memory retrieval. Much of this research focuses on establishing the existence of situation models, often by using tasks that assess one dimension of a situation model. However, the authors argue that the time has now come for researchers to begin to take the multidimensionality of situation models seriously. The authors offer a theoretical framework and some methodological observations that may help researchers to tackle this issue.},

A growing number of philosophers claim that fictional characters are abstract objects akin to novels or plots. They argue that postulating characters provides the most straightforward explanation of our literary practices as well as a uniform account of discourse and thought about fiction. Anti-realists counter that postulation is neither necessary nor straightforward, and that the invocation of pretense provides a better account of the same phenomena. I outline and assess these competing theories.},

Salmon invokes abstract artifacts as the referents of fictional names in both object- and meta-fictional discourse alike. He then invokes a theory of pretence to forge the requisite connection between object-fictional sentences and meta-fictional sentences, in virtue of which the latter can be assigned appropriate truth-values. I argue that Salmon's account of pretence renders his appeal to abstract artifacts as the referents of fictional names in object-fictional discourse explanatorily redundant. I further argue that his account is therefore no improvement over those he criticises, thus leaving his own account unmotivated.},

	Abstract = {The challenge of handling fictional discourse is to find the best way to resolve the apparent inconsistencies in our ways of speaking about fiction. A promising approach is to take at least some such discourse to involve pretense, but does all fictional discourse involve pretense? I will argue that a better, less revisionary, solution is to take internal and fictionalizing discourse to involve pretense, while allowing that in external critical discourse, fictional names are used seriously to refer to fictional characters. I then address two objections to such realist theories of fiction: One, that they can't adequately account for the truth of singular nonexistence claims involving fictional names, and two, that accepting that there are fictional characters to which we refer is implausible or ontologically profligate.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, the author replies to a question raised about theories of nonexistent objects. The question concerns the way names of fictional characters, when analyzed as names which denote nonexistent objects, acquire their denotations. Since nonexistent objects cannot causally interact with existent objects, it is thought that we cannot appeal to a'dubbing'or a'baptism'. The question is, therefore, what is the starting point of the chain? The answer is that storytellings are to be thought of as extended baptisms, and the details of this response receive attention in the paper. Once the storytelling is complete, and the characters have been baptized, a priori metaphysical principles linking the storytelling with the realm of nonexistent objects provide the referential, non-causal connection between the names used in the storytelling and the objects denoted by such names.},

The ontological commitments that the article examines arise in cases where there are norms governing discourse about items in a fiction that cannot be accounted for by reference to the contents of the sentences that constitute a canonical telling of that fiction. In such cases, a fiction may depend for its contents on the real-world properties of real-world items, and the fiction may, in that sense, be ontologically committed. Having outlined a way of gauging the ontological commitments of a fiction, the article concludes by illustrating the way in which these considerations can be put to work in assessing the prospects of using fictionalism as a tactic for understanding the metaphysics of modality without incurring a commitment to the real existence of merely possible worlds.},

	Abstract = {According to the conjunction rule, the probability of A and B cannot exceed the probability of either single event. This rule reads and in terms of the logical operator [logical and], interpreting A and B as an intersection of two events. As linguists have long argued, in natural language "and" can convey a wide range of relationships between conjuncts such as temporal order {("I} went to the store and bought some whisky"), causal relationships {("Smile} and the world smiles with you"), and can indicate a collection of sets rather than their intersection (as in {"He} invited friends and colleagues to the party"). When "and" is used in word problems researching the conjunction fallacy, the conjunction rule, which assumes the logical operator [logical and], therefore cannot be mechanically invoked as a norm. Across several studies, we used different methods of probing people's understanding of and-conjunctions, and found evidence that many of those respondents who violated the conjunction rule in their probability or frequency judgments inferred a meaning of and that differs from the logical operator [logical and]. We argue that these findings have implications for whether judgments involving ambiguous and-conjunctions that violate the conjunction rule should be considered manifestations of fallacious reasoning or of reasonable pragmatic and semantic inferences.},

literary assertions.1 Direct assertions put forward propositions on a literal level and function as the author's
assertions even if detached from their original context and applied in so-called ordinary discourse. Literary
assertions, in turn, intertwine with the fictional discourse: they may be, for instance, uttered by a fictional
character or refer to fictitious objects and yet convey the author's genuine assertions. The structure of the paper
is twofold. The first, descriptive part is a question--answer type of discussion in which I shall introduce general
philosophical arguments against assertions in fiction and present counter-arguments to them, paving the road to
my account of literary assertions. In the second, argumentative part, in turn, I shall examine the nature of literary
assertions, such as their semantic and `aspectival' characteristics and their peculiar illocutionary force as well as
the reader's stance toward them.},

In this paper I argue that models share important aspects in common with literary fiction, and that therefore theories of fiction can be brought to bear on these questions. In particular, I argue that the pretence theory as developed by Walton (1990, Mimesis as make-believe: on the foundations of the representational arts. Harvard University Press, {Cambridge/MA)} has the resources to answer these questions. I introduce this account, outline the answers that it offers, and develop a general picture of scientific modelling based on it.},

	Abstract = {It is common in various quarters of philosophy to derive philosophically significant conclusions from theories of reference. In this paper, we argue that philosophers should give up on such 'arguments from reference.' Intuitions play a central role in establishing theories of reference, and recent cross-cultural work suggests that intuitions about reference vary across cultures and between individuals within a culture {(Machery} et al. 2004). We argue that accommodating this variation within a theory of reference undermines arguments from reference.},
