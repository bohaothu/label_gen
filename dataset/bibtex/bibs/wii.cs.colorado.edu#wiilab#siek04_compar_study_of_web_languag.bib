  abstract={The surg of ubiquitous devices and WiFi in the last few years have 
given the general public access to information via the world wide 
web from anywhere at anytime. Mobile web access challenges de- 
velopers to create web pages that are usable and familiar to the user 
without unduly burdening the information applianceâ€™s limited sy- 
stem resources. The best way to achieve these goals is to follow the 
readily available standards geared towards effective presentation of 
information in a wide variety of information appliances. This paper 
reports on a comprehensive comparison of six popular mobile web 
browsers and the language functionality they support.
