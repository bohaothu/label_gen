	      abstract = {Much currently transmitted information takes the form of e-mails or SMS text messages and so extracting information from such short messages is increasingly important.  The words in a message can be partitioned into the syntactic structure, terms from the domain of discourse and the data being transmitted.  This paper describes a light-weight Information Extraction component which uses pattern matching to separate the three aspects: the structure is supplied as a template; domain terms are the metadata of a data source (or their synonyms), and data is extracted as those words matching placeholders in the templates.},keywords = {"Information Extraction" "Text Mining" E-mail "SMS Text"},Publisher =
