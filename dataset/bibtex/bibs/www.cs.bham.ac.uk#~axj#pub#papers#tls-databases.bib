  abstract = 	{This work presents first steps towards a denotational
		  semantics for relational data\-ba\-ses. It is argued
		  that such a semantics will increase the chances of
		  successfully incorporating relational databases into
		  typed programming languages. Database relations are
		  seen as sets of data of a common structure. The main
		  problem therefore is to model a type of sets.  We
		  propose the {\em snack powerdomain\/} for this
		  purpose.

  		  Technically, the paper attempts to clarify two
		  aspects of the domain theoretic background of this
		  approach. We give a localic description of the snack
		  powerdomain construction which reveals its logical
		  simplicity. Second, we study a subdomain relation
		  between Scott-domains on the denotational and the
		  logical level. Again, the logical version is simple
		  and intuitive. Such a relation is indispensable for
		  introducing database operations such as `natural
		  join'.}
