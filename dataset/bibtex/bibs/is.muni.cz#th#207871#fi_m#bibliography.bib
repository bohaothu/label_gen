    abstract = {{G}aussian filtering is one of the most successfully operation in computer vision in order to reduce noise, calculating the gradient intensity change or performing {L}aplacian or the second directional derivative of an image. {H}owever, it is well known that in a multi-resolution context, where the need for large filters is required, this technique suffers from the fact it is a computationally expensive since the number of operations per point in convolving an image with a {G}aussian filter is directly proportional to the width of the operator. {W}e propose in this paper a technique in order to use {G}aussian filtering with a reduced and fixed number of operations per output independently of the size of the filter. {T}he key of our approach is to approximate in a mean square sense the prototype {G}aussian filters with an exponentially based filter family depending on the same scale factor than the {G}aussian filters (i.e. s) and then to implement in an exact and recursive way the approximate filters. {A}n important point of the design presented in this paper is that dealing with {G}aussian filters having different scale factor (i.e. s) will not require a new design algorithm as. {T}he coefficients looked for in the recursive realization are determined function of the scale factor of each considered prototype filter, namely the {G}aussian filter, its first and second derivative. {S}ome experimental results will be shown to illustrate the efficiency of the approximation process and some applications to edge detection problems and multi-resolution techniques will be considered and discussed.},

        abstract = {This paper describes VIPS, an dimage processing system developed by the authors in the course of the EU-funded projects VASARI (1989-92) and MARC (92-95). VIPS implements a fully demand-driven dataflow image IO system. Evalutaion of library functions is delayed for as long as possible. When evaluation does occur, all delayed operations evaluate together in a pipeline, requiring no space for storing intermediate images and no unecessary disc IO. If more than one CPUT is available, then VIPS operations will automatically evaluate in parallel, giving an approximately linear speed-up.

The evaluation system can be controlled by the application programmer. We have implemented a user-interface for the VIPS library which uses expose events in an X window rather than disc output to drive evaluation. This makes it possible, for example, for the user to rotate an 800 MByte image by 12 degrees and immediately scroll around the result.}
