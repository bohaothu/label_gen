  abstract = {Today?s automotive sensor systems for in-vehicle based target tracking,
	i.e. radar, lidar, camera, are limited to a field of view which is
	restricted by distance, angle and line-of-sight. Future driver assistance
	systems such as predictive collision avoidance or situationaware
	adaptive cruise control require a more complete and accurate situation
	awareness in order to detect hazardous and inefficient situations
	in time. Therefore, we introduce multi-target tracking including
	Vehicle-2-Vehicle communications as a complementing sensor for future
	driver assistance systems. The paper presents first simulation results
	of our algorithm which show promising outcomes.},
