  abstract =     "Standardized medical terminologies are often used for
                 the registration of patient data. In several situations
                 there is a need to align these terminologies to other
                 terminologies. Even when the terminologies cover the
                 same domain, this is often a non-trivial task. The task
                 is even more complicated when the terminology does not
                 contain much structure. In this paper we describe the
                 initial results of a procedure for mapping a
                 terminology with little or no structure to a
                 structure-rich terminology. This procedure uses the
                 knowledge of the structure-rich terminology and a
                 method for semantic explicitation of concept
                 descriptions. The first results shows that, when
                 compared to approaches based on syntactic analysis
                 only, the recall can be greatly improved without
                 sacrificing much of the precision.",

  abstract =     "Recently, a widespread interest has emerged in using
                 ontologies on the Web. RDF Schema (RDFS) is a basic
                 tool that enables users to define vocabulary, structure
                 and constraints for expressing metadata about Web
                 resources. However, it includes no provisions for
                 formal semantics, and its expressivity is not
                 sufficient for full-fledged ontological modeling and
                 reasoning. In this paper, we will show how RDFS can be
                 extended to include a more expressive knowledge
                 representation language. That, in turn, would enrich it
                 with the required additional expressivity and the
                 semantics of that language.We do this by describing the
                 ontology language OIL as an extension of RDFS. An
                 important advantage to our approach is that it ensures
                 maximal sharing of meta-data on the Web: even partial
                 interpretation of an OIL ontology by less semantically
                 aware processors will yield a correct partial
                 interpretation of the meta-data.",

                 Ontologies will play a major role in supporting
                 information exchange processes in various areas. A
                 prerequisite for such a role is the development of a

                 ontologies. The purpose of the paper is precisely
                 concerned with this necessity. We will present OIL,
                 which is a proposal for such a standard. It is based on

                 supporting the information exchange processes, as they
                 provide a shared and common understanding of a domain.
                 However, it is still an important question how
                 ontologies can be applied fruitfully to online
                 resources. Therefore, we will investigate the relation
                 between ontology representation languages and document
                 structure techniques (schemas) on the web. We will do
                 this by giving a detailed comparison of OIL, a proposal
                 for expressing ontologies in the Web, with XML Schema,
                 a proposed standard for describing the structure and
                 semantics of XML based documents. We will argue that
                 these two refer to different levels of abstraction, but
                 that, in several cases, it can be advantageous to base
                 a document schema on an ontology. Lastly, we will show
                 how this can be done by providing an translation
                 procedure from an OIL ontology to a specific XML
                 Schema. This will result in a schema that can be used
                 to capture instances of the ontology.",
