		  uses as an example the common use of Unix | combine
		  language processors that generate output in another
		  "little" language which are processed by further the

		  extend in the manner just mentioned.  He mentions
		  what I think is a key aspect, which is that a
		  micro-language can escape the Von Neumann view of
		  computation found in programming languages.  This is
		  important because it is just that that
		  non-programmers will have difficulty with.  He
		  mentions this in saying that it is necessary to make
		  a conscience effort to avoid this view when
		  designing a "little" language and one must really
		  think about what are the fundamental abstractions
		  of the problem are.  He also mentions some informal

                  obtained by combining a monovariant BTA and a polyvariant

                  to be specialized in order to include the computation of 
                  the binding times of each function parameter. In particular
                  a new parameter is associated to each function parameter. 
                  The parameter gives the binding time of the initial 
                  parameter. The new program can then be partially evaluated,
                  using a monovariant BTA, with respect to the binding times 
                  of the entry point. The effect of this first 
                  specialization is to create clones of functions for which
                  different call binding-time patterns exist. The resulting
                  program can then be partially evaluated with respect to the
                  actual static input data.
                  A way of dealing with partially static conditionals, based
                  on the same kind of technique, is also sketched.}

We describe Vortex, an optimizing compiler intended to produce
high-quality code for programs written in a heavily-object-oriented
style. To achieve this end, Vortex includes a number of intra- and
interprocedural static analyses that can exploit knowledge about the
whole program being compiled, including intraprocedural class
analysis, class hierarchy analysis, and exhaustive class testing, and
profile-guided optimizations such as receiver class prediction and
selective specialization. To make whole-program optimization
practical, Vortex automatically tracks cross-file optimization
dependencies at a fine granularity, triggering selective recompilation
of affected compiled files whenever the source program
changes. Empirical measurements of five purely object-oriented
benchmark programs written in Cecil, ranging in size from several
hundred to 75,000 lines of source code, indicate that these
optimization techniques improve performance of large programs by more
than a factor of three over a system with only intraprocedural static
optimizations.  Vortex is written in Cecil, and it has been used as
its own compiler and optimizer during its development for the past two
years. Vortex's optimizations and implementation techniques should be
useful for any language or program where optimizations to reduce the
cost of polymorphism are important, including object-oriented
languages (we are currently adding front-ends for C++, Modula-3, and
Java to Vortex to study its effectiveness on these other language
styles) and other high-level symbolic, functional, and logic
languages.},

  abstract =     "Predicate classes are a new linguistic construct
                 designed to complement normal classes in
                 object-oriented languages. Like a normal class, a
                 predicate class has a set of superclasses, methods, and
                 instance variables. However, unlike a normal class, an
                 object is automatically an instance of a predicate
                 class whenever it satisfies a predicate expression
                 associated with the predicate class. The predicate
                 expression can test the value or state of the object,
                 thus supporting a form of implicit property-based
                 classification that augments the explicit type-based
                 classification provided by normal classes. By
                 associating methods with predicate classes, method
                 lookup can depend not only on the dynamic class of an
                 argument but also on its dynamic value or state. If an
                 object is modified, the property-based classification
                 of an object can change over time, implementing shifts
                 in major behavior modes of the object. A version of
                 predicate classes has been designed and implemented in
                 the context of the Cecil language.",

   based Suns and a RISC workstation). They studied the length of the
   common, normal path through the code on both input and
   output. TCP/IP processing takes at most 300-400 instructions,
   depending upon architecture if implemented efficiently. The real
   bottleneck is in the operating system's implementation of buffers
   and timers. Contrary to popular belief, the most expensive part of
   the TCP protocol is the sender not the reciever.  The generation of
   the checksum, moving the data between kernel buffers and user
   memory and recovering of the TCB are all potentially more expensive
   than the core of the protocol itself. It is recommended that kernel
   buffers be forgotten and that the checksum be computed directly by
   the CPU whilst it is moving the data (no DMA).  The 96bits required
   to locate a TCB entry could be hashed to 8 bits. One can assume
   that each new packet uses the same TCB with a surprisingly high hit
   ratio even on heavily loaded machines. Using a 10MIPS CPU, it is
   predicted that TCP could handle 530Mbps. On a 32bit processor with
   250ns DRAM, the memory bandwidth is only 32Mbps so this can be the
   limiting factor. Protocol implementation in silicon is advised
   against as it prevents easy adjustments to the protocol
   implementation and design. Specialised outboard processors
   utilising the high speed sequential access mode of DRAMs may help,
   but buffering becomes more complex and possilby slower.",

   interprocess communication facilities to use continuations as the
   basis for control transfer. Compared to previous versions of Mach
   3.0, our new system consumes 85% less space per
   thread. Cross-address space remote procedure calls execute
   14%faster. Exception handling runs over 60% faster. In addition to
   improving system performance, we have used continuations to
   generalize many control transfer optimizations that are common to
   operating systems, and have recast those optimizations in terms of
   a single implementation methodology. This paper describes our
   experiences with using continuations in the Mach operating
   system."

		  further research into this programming paradigm.  It
		  seems fairly similar to what we would like to do.
		  Here one defines domains, which consist of a small
		  language and some program transformations.  Once
		  defined in the systems it is known as a domain
		  theory.  The transformations describe the semantics
		  of the small language by describing transformations
		  of constructs into other constructs of the language
		  or to any other domain theory that has been
		  defined.  Thus one can have any arbitrary hierarchy
		  of languages.  Once given a target language (usually
		  one that can be compiled like C) the system (with
		  user guidance) applies transformation rules to a
		  given program to derive a program in the
		  implementation language.  One of the
		  problems with their approach which we don't have
		  is that there is no mechanism to cross
		  language boundaries in a program.  Which from my 
		  understanding means your program
		  has to be written in one language remain in one
		  language throughout the derivation process, which in
		  essence limits you to a linear hierarchy.}

PLAN (Packet Language for Active Networks) is a new language for
programs that form the packets of a programmable network.  These
programs replace the packet headers (which can be viewed as very
rudimentary programs) used in current networks.  As such, PLAN
programs are lightweight and of restricted functionality.  These
limitations are mitigated by allowing PLAN code to call node-resident
{\em service routines} written in other, more powerful languages.
This two-level architecture, in which PLAN serves as a scripting or
`glue' language for more general services, is the primary contribution
of this paper. We have successfully applied the PLAN programming
environment to implement an IP-free internetwork.

PLAN is based on the simply typed lambda calculus and provides a
restricted set of primitives and datatypes.  PLAN defines a special
construct called a {\em chunk} used to describe the remote execution
of PLAN programs on other nodes. Primitive operations on chunks are
used to provide basic data transport in the network and to support
layering of protocols.  Remote execution can make debugging difficult,
so PLAN provides strong static guarantees to the programmer, such as
type safety.  A more novel property aimed at protecting network
availability is a guarantee that PLAN programs use a bounded amount of
network resources.},

We present {\em PLANet}: an active network architecture and
implementation.  In addition to a standard suite of Internet-like
services, PLANet has two key programmability features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item all packets contain programs
\item router functionality may be extended dynamically
\end{enumerate}
Packet programs are written in our special purpose programming
language PLAN, the Packet Language for Active Networks, while dynamic
router extensions are written in OCaml, a dialect of ML.

Currently, PLANet routers run as byte-code-interpreted Linux
user-space applications, and support Ethernet and IP as link layers.
PLANet achieves respectable performance on standard networking
operations: on 300~MHz Pentium-II's attached to 100~Mbps Ethernet,
PLANet can route 48~Mbps and switch over 5000 packets per second.  We
demonstrate the utility of PLANet's activeness by showing
experimentally how it can non-trivially improve application and
aggregate network performance in congested conditions.},

   any given protocol layer. For each design technique, the paper

		  that it can be used for any underlying methodologies

		  which will necessarily be a problem in the future
		  environment of a deregulated telecommunications

		  (can have multiple implementations as long as they
		  obey the interface of the component)
		  Standardization, reusable, capable of hiding details
		  of distribution, integrateable (can be used with

  abstract =     "Code to implement network protocols can be ither
                 inside the kernel of an operating system or in
                 user-level processes. Kernel-resident code is hard to
                 develop, debug, and maintain, but user-level
                 implementations typically incur significant overhead
                 and perform poorly. The performance of user-level
                 network code depends on the mechanism used to
                 demultiplex received packets. Demultiplexing in a
                 user-level process increases the rate of context
                 switches and system calls, resulting in poor
                 performance. Demultiplexing in the kernel eliminates
                 unnecessary overhead. This paper describes the packet
                 filter, a kernel-resident, protocol-independent packet
                 demultiplexer. Individual user processes have great
                 flexibility in selecting which packets they will
                 receive. Protocol implementations using the packet
                 filter perform quite well, and have been in production
                 use for several years.",

                 and conventional computations and provides flexible and
                 accurate control over the sharing of processor time.
                 SMART is able to satisfy real-time constraints in an
                 optimal manner and provide proportional sharing across
                 all real-time and conventional tasks. Furthermore, when
                 not all real-time constraints can be met, SMART
                 satisfies each real-time task's proportional share of
                 deadlines, and adjusts its execution rate dynamically.
                 This technique is especially important for multimedia
                 applications that can operate at different rates
                 depending on the loading condition. This paper presents
                 the design of SMART and provides measured performance
                 results of its effectiveness based on a prototype
                 implementation in the Solaris operating system.",

		  represented by a finite-state machine.  Components
		  are combined by giving a path expression for the
		  composite program, where a path expression is like a
		  regular expression that describes the possible
		  execution paths.  Each component is described by
		  some code and a corresponding path expression.  The
		  path of the composite program can thus be projected
		  onto the path of each component to determine what
		  part of the component is needed, the corresponding
		  code is that merged with that of the all the other
		  components by reversing the projection.}

		  reuse, that it is difficult to identify patterns
		  which one needs in order to practice reuse.  However
		  they say that by restricting yourself to a
		  particular (small) class of services, these
		  patterns are easier to identify and it is easier to

		  The key point being that the internals of the box
		  are available for adaptation as opposed to the other

		  use of formal feature interaction there must be:
		  The model used for detection must be easily, if not
		  automatically extendable, so the design is not

		  is added. There must be some interface to the

                 applications to modify kernel behavior by providing
                 mechanisms for application code to run in the kernel
                 address space. The advantage of this approach is that
                 it provides improved application flexibility and
                 performance; the disadvan tage is that buggy or
                 malicious code can jeopardize the integrity of the
                 kernel. It has been demonstrated that it is feasible to
                 use safe languages, software fault isolation, or
                 virtual memory protection to safeguard the main kernel.
                 However, such protection mechanisms do not address the
                 full range of problems, such as resource hoarding, that
                 can arise when application code is intro duced into the
                 kernel. In this paper, we present an analysis of
                 extension mechanisms in the VINO kernel. VINO uses
                 software fault isolation as its safety mechanism and a
                 lightweight transaction system to cope with
                 resource-hoarding. We explain how these two mechanisms
                 are sufficient to protect against a large class of
                 errant or malicious extensions, and we quantify the
                 overhead that this protection introduces. We find that
                 while the overhead of these techniques is high relative
                 to the cost of the extensions themselves, it is low
                 relative to the benefits that extensibility brings.",

                 page replacement policy and centralized frame pool that
                 cannot properly serve all types of memory access
                 patterns of various applications. As a result, many
                 memory-intensive applications, such as databases,
                 multimedia applications and scientific simulators,
                 induce excessive page faults and page replacement when
                 running on top of existing operating systems. \par This
                 paper presents a High Performance External virtual
                 memory Caching mechanism (HiPEC) to provide
                 applications with their own specific page replacement
                 management. The user specific policy, programmed in the
                 HiPEC command set, is stored in user address space.
                 When a page fault occurs, the kernel fetches and
                 interprets the corresponding policy commands to perform
                 the user-specific page replacement management.
                 Experimental results show that HiPEC induces little
                 overhead and can significantly improve performance for
                 memory-intensive applications.",
