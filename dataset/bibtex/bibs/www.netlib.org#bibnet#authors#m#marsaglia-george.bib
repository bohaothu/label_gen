                 random variables in a computer. The idea is to
                 represent the required $X$ in the form: $X = C (M + U_1
                 + U_2 + U_3)$, some 97--99\% of the time, where c is
                 constant, $M$ is a discrete random variable taking
                 perhaps $8$ values, and the $U$'s are uniform random
                 variables; the other 1--3\% of the time, $X$ is
                 generated from a residual density by the rejection
                 technique. These two methods for producing $X$ are
                 combined in the proper proportions in order that the
                 resulting distribution for $X$ be correct. The method
                 is general in that it applies to a wide variety of
                 density functions. Programs based on this procedure are
                 very fast and require little computer storage space ---
                 typically, 18 constants and 20 instructions.",

                 the blood may be exposed to radiation without danger to
                 body tissues. There is some probability theory
                 connected with such procedures, for the cells of the
                 blood are thoroughly mixed in the body, and hence the
                 number of times a blood cell passes through the shunt
                 is a random variable. Several papers have been written
                 to describe such systems by differential equations;
                 this paper discusses the problem directly in terms of

                 with independent binary digits $b_n$ taking values 0 or
                 1 with probability $p_n$ and $q_n = 1 - p_n$. When does
                 $X$ have a density? A continuous density? A singular
                 distribution? This note gives necessary and sufficient
                 conditions for the distribution of $X$ to be: discrete:
                 $\Sigma\min (p_n, q_n) < \infty$; singular:
                 $\Sigma^\infty_m\lbrack\log (p_n/q_n)\rbrack^2 =
                 \infty$ for every $m$; absolutely continuous:

                 \infty$ for some $m$. Furthermore, $X$ has a density
                 that is bounded away from zero on some interval if and
                 only if $\log (p_n/q_n)$ is a geometric sequence with
                 ratio $\frac{1}{2}$ for $n > k$, and in that case the

  abstract =     "It is now possible to do serious scientific work on
                 personal computers (PC's). Many simulation studies,
                 whether exploratory or for production runs, call for
                 random numbers. We offer here a new kind of random
                 number generator with implementation tailored
                 specifically for PC's using Intel 8088/8086 or
                 80286/80386 processors. A floating-point coprocessor is
                 not required or even useful for the generator,
                 although, of course, a coprocessor may help other parts
                 of a simulation. The generator has an extremely long
                 period --- some 2^{1407} --- requires only 43 stored
                 values and uses only one arithmetic operation:
                 subtraction. It is one of a new class of generators
                 that we have recently developed. They are called
                 add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow generators.
                 Related to lagged-Fibonacci generators, the new class
                 has an interesting underlying theory, astonishingly
                 long periods and provable uniformity for full
                 sequences. This article describes a machine language

                 all different, from 1 to 49. Most probability analysis
                 assumes that this is like sampling without replacement
                 from an urn. On the other hand, it is well known that
                 many people pick 'lucky' numbers such as 7 and 11 more
                 frequently than 'ordinary' numbers such as 17 or 26.
                 For some lotteries, information is available on the
                 frequencies with which players have chosen each of the
                 numbers from 1 to 49. This raises the interesting
                 question of finding distributions on the $49 \choose 6$
                 possible ticket choices that will be consistent with
                 the frequencies specified for each of the elements. We
                 develop several methods for doing this; some of them
                 may be extended to the next stages of the problem, when
                 enough information is available from the Lottery to
                 specify frequencies of pairs or even triples, and one
                 seeks distributions on the 6-tuples consistent with
                 those frequencies.",

                 in generating normal random variable by computer
                 programs. The suggested applications are related to
                 Monte Carlo simulation based on massively parallel
                 systems or supercomputers. The idea is to replace
                 larger programs with complicated computations and with
                 difficulties in accuracy controlling by simpler
                 arithmetic programs that use tabled constants. These
                 seem to be the normal evolution since memory becomes
                 cheaper and cheaper.\par The authors compute the
                 inverse of the cPhi function $$cPhi(x) = (2/\pi)^{1/2}
                 \int^\infty_x \exp (-t^2/2) dt=u,$$ using a uniform
                 random variable as input and the truncated Taylor
                 series development of it. In order to increase the
                 speed the coefficients of the truncated Taylor series
                 $$x(u_0+h) = x(u_0) + x'(u_0) \cdot h + {1 \over 2}
                 x''(u_0) \cdot h^2 + {1 \over 6} x'''(u_0) \cdot h^3,$$
                 are predetermined for 1024 points. And here comes
                 another bright idea: the 1024 points are chosen based
                 on the representation of the uniform random variable in
                 modern computers as floating point variable of the
                 form: $u=2^{-k} ((1/2) + (j/64)) + 2^{-k} \cdot
                 (m/2^{24})$ with $0 \le k&lt;32$, $0 \le j&lt;32$ and
                 $0 \le m&lt;2^{18}$ and considering 32 bit
                 representation.\par With this assumptions and the
                 truncation to the third power of $h$ of the Taylor
                 series, the authors show that the error does not exceed
                 the limit of single precision accuracy. Furthermore the
                 calculations are speeded up based on reducing
                 multiplications. A number of FORTRAN programs are also
                 presented in order to evaluate the complementary normal
                 distribution function cPhi (several versions) with
                 great accuracy, create the constant tables, and
                 generate the normal distribution variable. These simple
                 programs give the user the possibility to completely
                 control the accuracy.",

  abstract =     "The Monty Python Method for generating random
                 variables takes a decreasing density, cuts it into
                 three pieces, then, using area-preserving
                 transformations, folds it into a rectangle of area $1$.
                 A random point $(x,y)$ from that rectangle is used to
                 provide a variate from the given density, most of the
                 time as $x$ itself or a linear function of $x$. The
                 decreasing density is usually the right half of a
                 symmetric density.\par

                 The Monty Python method has provided short and fast
                 generators for normal, $t$ and von Mises densities,
                 requiring, on the average, from $1.5$ to $1.8$ uniform
                 variables. In this article, we apply the method to
                 non-symmetric densities, particularly the important
                 gamma densities. We lose some of the speed and
                 simplicity of the symmetric densities, but still get a
                 method for variates that is simple and fast enough to

                 Note that these tests concern the randomness of a

                 uniform 32-bit integers. For uses where the output is

                 \cite{Tu:2005:SRD} has led to worldwide reports that Pi
                 is less random than we thought, or that Pi is not the
                 best random number generator, or that Pi seems good but
                 not the best. A careful examination of the Tu and
                 Fischman procedure shows that it is needlessly
                 complicated and can be reduced to study of the average
                 value of $(U_2 - U_1) (U_2 - U_3)$ for uniform variates

                 B, C, D, E to a sample mean, based on its distance from
                 the expected value, suggests naivety in the extreme.
                 Application, in the present article, to the first 960

                 xorshift random number generators, whose implementation
                 uses three ``xorshift'' operations. They belong to a
                 large family of generators based on linear recurrences
                 modulo 2, which also includes shift-register
                 generators, the Mersenne twister, and several others.
                 In this article, we analyze the theoretical properties
                 of xorshift generators, search for the best ones with
                 respect to the equidistribution criterion, and test
                 them empirically. We find that the vast majority of

                 operations, including those having good
                 equidistribution, fail several simple statistical

                 posted a C version to various USENET newsgroups,
                 including sci.crypt. Marsaglia himself has never
                 claimed cryptographic security for the KISS generator,
                 but others have made the intellectual leap and claimed
                 that it is of cryptographic quality. In this paper we
                 show a number of reasons why the generator does not
                 meet some of the KISS authors' claims, why it is not
                 suitable for use as a stream cipher, and that it is not
                 cryptographically secure. Our best attack requires
                 about 70 words of generated output and a few hours of
                 computation to recover the initial state. In early
                 2011, G. Marsaglia posted a new version of KISS, which
                 falls to a simple divide-and-conquer attack.",
