 abstract={A method for constructing a pair of biorthogonal interpolatory multiscaling functions is given and an explicit formula for constructing the corresponding biorthogonal multiwavelets is obtained. A multiwavelet sampling theorem is also established. In addition, we improve the stability of the biorthogonal interpolatory multiwavelet frame by the linear combination of a pair of biorthogonal interpolatory multiwavelets. Finally, we give an example illustrating how to use our method to construct biorthogonal interpolatory multiscaling functions and corresponding multiwavelets. }

 abstract={In this paper, we compare the direct boundary element method (BEM) and the dual reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) for solving the direct interior Helmholtz problem, in terms of their numerical accuracy and efficiency, as well as their applicability and reliability in the frequency domain. For BEM formulation, there are two possible choices for fundamental solutions, which can lead to quite different conclusions in terms of their reliability in the frequency domain. For DRBEM formulation, it is shown that although the DBREM can correctly predict eigenfrequencies even for higher modes, it fails to yield a reasonably accurate numerical solution for the problem when the frequency is higher than the first eigenfrequency. }

 abstract={In slender-body theories, one often has to find asymptotic approximations for certain integrals, representing distributions of sources along a line segment. Here, such approximations are obtained by a systematic method that uses Mellin transforms. Results are given near the line (using cylindrical polar coordinates) and near the ends of the line segment (using spherical polar coordinates). }

 abstract={This paper discusses robust stochastic stability and stabilization of time-delay discrete Markovian jump singular systems with parameter uncertainties. Based on the restricted system equivalent (RES) transformation, a delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities condition for time-delay discrete-time Markovian jump singular systems to be regular, causal and stochastically stable is established. With this condition, problems of robust stochastic stability and stabilization are solved, and delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities are obtained. A numerical example is also given to illustrate the effectiveness of this method. }

 abstract={Formulating a dust-filled spherically symmetric metric utilizing the $3+1$ formalism for general relativity, we show that the metric coefficients are completely determined by the matter distribution throughout the spacetime. Furthermore, the metric describes both inhomogeneous dust regions and also vacuum regions in a single coordinate patch, thus alleviating the need for complicated matching schemes at the interfaces. In this way, the system is established as an initial boundary value problem, which has many benefits for its numerical evolution. We show the dust part of the metric is equivalent to the class of Lemaitre--Tolman--Bondi (LTB) metrics under a coordinate transformation. In this coordinate system, shell crossing singularities (SCS) are exhibited as fluid shock waves, and we therefore discuss possibilities for the dynamical extension of shell crossings through the initial point of formation by borrowing methods from classical fluid dynamics. This paper fills a void in the present literature associated with these collapse models by fully developing the formalism in great detail. Furthermore, the applications provide examples of the benefits of the present model. }

 abstract={A class of mixed control-state constrained optimal control problems for elliptic partial differential equations arising, for example, in Lavrentiev-type regularized state constrained optimal control is considered. Its numerical solution is obtained via a primal-dual active-set method, which is equivalent to a class of semi-smooth Newton methods. The locally superlinear convergence of the active-set method in function space is established, and its mesh independence is proved. The paper contains a report on numerical test runs including a comparison with a short-step path-following interior-point method and a coarse-to-fine mesh sweep, that is, a nested iteration technique, for accelerating the overall solution process. Finally, convergence and regularity properties of the regularized problems with respect to a vanishing Lavrentiev parameter are considered. }

 abstract={A class of evolution equations in divergence form is studied in this paper. Specifically, we develop conditions under which the spatial divergence term, the flux, corresponds to the characteristic of a conservation law. The KdV equation is a prominent example of an equation having a flux term that is also a characteristic for a conservation law. We show that the flux term must be self-adjoint. General equations for the corresponding conservation laws and Hamiltonian densities are derived and supplemented with examples. }
