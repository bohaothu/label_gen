abstract = {This report describes a probabilistic approach to template-based chord recognition in music signals.
The algorithm only takes chromagram data and a user-defined dictionary of chord templates
as input data. No training or musical information such as key, rhythm or chord transition models is
required. The chord occurrences are treated as probabilistic events, whose probabilities are learned
from the song using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The adaptative estimation of
these probabilities (together with an ad-hoc post-processing filtering) has the desirable effect of
smoothing out spurious chords that would occur in our previous baseline work.
Our algorithm is compared to various methods that entered the Music Information Retrieval
Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) in 2008 and 2009, using a diverse set of evaluation metrics, some of
them new. The systems are tested on two evaluation corpus; the first one is composed of the Beatles
catalog (180 pop-rock songs) and the other one is constituted by 20 songs from various artists
and music genres. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art chord recognition
systems.
