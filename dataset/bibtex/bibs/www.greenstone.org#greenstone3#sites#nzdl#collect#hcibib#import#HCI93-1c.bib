%X To investigate the relationship between bio-chemical stress measure and
psychological measure and to find the most suitable stress-index, a
longitudinal observation of the job content and stress-index in each
individuals is conducted for six months.  As stress measures, biochemical
stress index (adrenaline/noradrenaline from urine sample and cortisol from
saliva sample) and psychological index (subjective rating method) were used. 
The work-content of each day and each week were also surveyed using a
diary-style.  The results showed that cortisol increases when the
overwork/subjective business increases (p<0.01) and that adrenaline decreases
when subjective rating (drowsiness, pain, anxiety, depression) increases
(p<0.01).  These results are conducted by the inter-individual analysis.  When
we use the intra-individual analysis, the best stress-index for each individual
is suggested from the results.

%X The Finnish longitudinal studies on the relationship between the use of VDT
application and psychological and social demands of work and individual
characteristics are reviewed.  The main focus is on various types of
longitudinal study designs applied, and on the evaluation of their relevance. 
Although a rather long follow-up time is preferable, its optimum length is hard
to decide because of the varying life span of a single VDT application.  Also
the novelty connected to the use of VDT applications is no longer actual for
employees.  Therefore the personal meaning of some specific change in the VDT
to an individual, and the cultural context where it is applied, are important.
In most cases, longitudinal designs with both quantitative and qualitative
methods offer the only way to grasp the critical points.

%X Continuous development of data systems, simultaneously with increased
competition and product diversification in the insurance business, is a highly
demanding challenge to both software experts and to human resource developers
in the field.  A follow-up study in 1985 and 1987 revealed that new computer
applications were experienced to have increased more often than decreased the
positive characteristics at work.  A third follow-up survey (n=260) was
conducted in 1993 in one insurance company.  This paper focuses on the changes
in the use of computers and in the mastery of applications.  The results are
analyzed according to occupation and age groups.  Recommendations for the
development of training and user support are discussed.  Both the research
instruments and the support given to the users should be planned more
specifically as regards the respondents' individual work situation.  A specific
intervention program was carried out for elderly sales managers in the company.
Successful change to the new organization of tasks is a long-lasting process,
and demands a several years' longitudinal study and user support at the
work-site level.

%X A four-week diary study of computer-related problems (slowdown, breakdown
and other problems) was conducted to examine the cumulative effects of computer
use on worker stress.  Computer-related problems were conceptualized as "daily
hassles" that can affect worker stress when the exposure time is high.  Weekly
analyses showed that negative effects of computer slowdown and breakdown, and
frequency of other problems were correlated with mood disturbances.  Monthly
analyses showed that the cumulative number of other computer problems, but not
the cumulative measures of slowdown and breakdown, were correlated to worker
stress.

Occupational Overuse Syndromes (OOS).  The authors divide OOS into localised
and diffuse variants.  The latter syndrome affects muscles and is, in their
experience, more common.  There are important differences in the treatment of
the localised and diffuse syndromes, but muscle tension is taken as the main
cause of both.  Relaxation, the antidote to muscle tension, is a unifying idea
behind both prevention and management strategies.  The guide is directed at
general practitioners, physiotherapists and others who might have occasion to
treat OOS.

 * There is a general increase in the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcome
   associated with VDU work.
 * There is an increase in the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcome -- but
   only in some subgroups
of VDU users.  Such subgroups are in principle identified by a specific factor
or factors.  In this review, we discuss pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriages
in recognised pregnancies, serious malformations at birth and indications of
reduced growth.  For other reproductive or pregnancy outcomes such as early
birth, placental weights and fecundity, available data are limited which
reduces the possibility of meaningful evaluation.  Likewise, the review focuses
only on the womans' exposure -- data on reproductive outcomes associated with
male VDU work is virtually non-existent.

%X Stress related health effects from working with video display terminals
(VDT) are commonly reported in the literature.  Stressors may be both physical
and psychosocial in origin.  Initially, the health complaints concerned the
musculoskeletal system.  Subsequently, possible threat to the fetus, the eye
and the neurological and dermatological systems were mentioned.  Most recently,
reports have focused on techno-stress.  This is a psychophysiological response
caused by poor man-machine interface.  With the introduction of information
technologies, job content and skills requirements have changed substantially. 
Furthermore, the demand for increased productivity and efficiency in the white
collar sector has resulted in a continuous strain on the human body.  Unless
there is an appropriate adaptation of work organization and hardware and
software equipment, techno-stress and health related consequences will be an
ever increasing problem in the age of information technology.

%* (c) Copyright 1993 Elsevier Science Publishers
%X The aim of this paper was to propose a comfortable design for a visual
display terminal (VDT) workstation based on the size of the ocular surface area
(OSA) which is thought to be closely correlated eye dryness and eye fatigue. 
To attain our goal, an accurate method of measuring OSA was developed.  Using
this method, a high correlations both between vertical gaze direction and OSA,
and between width of the palpebral fissure and OSA were found.  In this study,
OSA was compared in people doing different types of work.  One type was
traditional office work without a VDT, the other was work with a VDT. 
Quantitative analysis showed that the OSA of VDT work was larger and that gaze
direction was higher than in work without a VDT.  In the word processing work,
in particular, a large amount of change in OSA frequently occurred.  That means
vigorous eye movements.  These phenomena must cause eye fatigue in VDT
operators.  Our recommendation for a comfortable VDT workstation design is that
the display be set lower and closer to the keyboard be positioned where workers
can maintain a smaller OSA.

%X The aim of this study was to evaluate working conditions during VDT
operation by analyzing of vertical eye movements at VDT workstations using a
flat panel display (FPD) and cathode ray tube (CRT).  A fundamental experiment
on eye movements during VDT operations was carried out to compare visual
comfort during work in FPD and CRT users.
   The average value for vertical fixation points at workstations using FPDs
was found to be lower than in those used CRTs.  The frequency distribution of
fixation points, however, had two phases with wide ranges due to data entry
work during both FPD and CRT operation.  In order to relieve visual fatigue or
eye strain caused by VDT operation, it is obvious that the VDT workstations
using FPDs provide more advantages than those using CRTs.

%X The purpose of this study was to investigate the tendency or preference of
the eyes to move to a computer-generated highlighted information in the
presence of another one.  Pairwise comparisons of blinking, reverse video,
color (red), and bold characters were made in four menus appearing at the top,
bottom, left, or right side of the computer display.  Each menu consisted of
five 3-letter alphabetic options; two highlighted and three non-highlighted. 
Subjects responded to four separate blocks of trial (one for each menu) and
were asked to locate a 3-letter alphabetic code in one of the two highlighted
options in the given menu.  An eye movement monitoring system recorded the
first movement of the eyes to one of the two highlighted codes.  The analysis
indicated that blinking attracted the most attention of the eyes in the
presence of one of the other three highlighted information, but color (red)
highlighting received the least preference of the eyes.  Furthermore, a
center-positioned highlighted option in a menu attracted the most attention of
the eyes.  These results were significant for all four menus.

task for 2 x 60 minutes.  Before the first 60 minute session, the subjects were
required to relax for 10 minutes with closed eyes.  After the first and the
second session, the subjects had a 5 minute pause during which they either
relaxed with closed eyes (experiment 1) or performed a standardized acupressure
program (experiment 2).
   The pre-experimental relaxation periods served as baselines for evaluation
of the two pause alternatives in terms of critical flicker fusion frequency,
near and far point accommodation time, and subjective rating of eyestrain
symptoms.  In comparison to relaxation with closed eyes, all evaluation
measures showed that acupressure was a superior method for relieving eyestrain.

%X Electronic document imaging is a "new" method for optical storage of
documents that is believed to be one of the most promising computer
applications of the next decades.  In a large scale industrial application
planned to process more than 30.000 documents per day, all relevant parts of
the work system were studied with the goal of finding the best working
conditions for the intended users who should work without any paper-based
documents.
   Due to technological restrictions, the documents can only be scanned with
rather low resolution leading to a substantial degradation of the typographic
quality.  Even when displayed on high resolution screens, the images of the
documents suffered substantial quality losses.  Unexpectedly, well-designed
forms and high quality print suffered more than hand-writing.  Another major
problem was the inconsistency of the user interface of the mainframe
applications and the imaging system.
   However, no fundamental problems could be detected that may prevent a
widespread use of imaging systems.  In view of the detected problems, slow
progress in the introduction of imaging systems is prognosticated.

was effective in reducing work stressors, such as workload, workload
dissatisfaction and underutilization of skills which, in turn, were related to
several measures of worker stress.  On the other hand, decision control was
related to increased workload and task uncertainty, and resource control to
increased workload.  There is support for the proposed model, but only
regarding the effect of task control.  This study shows the importance of
levels and facets of job control.

%X During recent years, the number of health-related complaints among employees
engaged in Video Display Terminal (VDT)-work have increased, as have reports of
the sick-building syndrome.  In order to better understand precipitating
factors, we have carried out detailed psycho-physiological and occupational
health studies of employees with and without VDT-related health complaints. 
Subjects were followed throughout a regular work-day as well as a day of
leisure.  Subjects with symptoms had higher serum levels of the stress-related
hormone prolactin and thyroxine during work and lower levels of anabolically
active sex hormones.  They also reported higher mental stress levels.  The air
humidity tended to be lower in offices with health complaints and sufferers
complained more frequently of eye symptoms.  There were no differences in
electromagnetic characteristics between employees with and without health
complaints.  Subjects highly dependent on their computer in their daily work
were more likely to report symptoms.  The study supports the notion of
technostress resulting in both physiological and cognitive consequences.  The
physical work environment, however, is an important co-factor.

Of the physiological indices, background EEG is studied from a human factors
point of view.  The author's study results about the relationship of mental
variations with theta waves and frontal midline theta waves in particular are
introduced.  It is shown that the appearance of theta waves increases from the
center of the frontal region to the parietal region as mental concentration
heightens.  This finding is considered effective in human interface research.

%X VDT work requires little energy consumption, but causes great vision and
psychological stresses to operators.  It is not possible to use metabolic
energy rate or other factor to calculate operator fatigue.  The effectiveness
of CFF was verified using VDT work as a stresser, employing catecholamine and
17-KS-S as reactions to stresses inside the body, catching signals outside the
body such as CFF, VEP, HRV and choice reaction time (CRT) and studying their
relationship.  The VDT operators were selected by grouping them into two
groups; one group with strong stresses applied and the other group which was
not.  The difference between the two groups was detected clearly.  The
availability of the results of this experiment was reconfirmed as a CFF fatigue
index.

evaluation of visual fatigue caused by VDT work, in an aspect of visual
ergonomics.  These indices are CFF, accommodation, pupil size, and eye
movements.  Besides eye movement characteristics, each value of these indices
was found to decrease after prolonged visual task in both experimental and
field survey studies.  Visual comfort in VDT work is also considered in this
paper by analyzing the physiological resting states of these indices.

this study.  The frequency spectrum of R-R intervals is analyzed with a set of
four digital filters implemented on a personal computer.  The method is

study using simple location tasks has shown that the workload evaluated with
this method is positively correlated with subjectively rated task difficulty.

%X This paper introduces the Wavelet Transform (WT) for analyzing heart rate
variability (HRV), which maps the HRV signal into the two-dimensional function
in the time-scale plane.  This WT precisely gives the location and power of the
HRV spectrum.  We applied this method to empirical data containing several
stressers.  WT definitely detected the decrease in power at high frequencies
when subjects hyperventilated.  WT also detected peaks of power at lower
frequencies.  We analyzed the WT results statistically.  The correlation
coefficients of the WT results between scales changed when the stressers were
given.  This method reveals the behavior of the power spectrum at lower
frequencies, which are known to play an important role in the modulation of
sympathetic activity.

explanation of worker health once effects of demographics and job stressors
have been removed.  Conclusions suggest that a more diverse perspective of
worker health is desirable and that job and organization design strategies for
reducing stress among female VDT workers can attend to these
extra-organizational factors as well.

%X The objectives of the present study were to assess and compare the job
stress, fatigue, job involvement and job satisfaction of the manual and
computerized bank employees.  The study was conducted on a total of 60
employees, randomly selected from six commercial banks in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
Out of the 60 employees, 30 were doing their works manually and 30 were using
computers for performing the same work.  The results show that the bank
employees working in the manual section experience significantly greater degree
of job stress and perceived fatigue than the employees working in the
computerized section.  However, there are no significant differences between
the two groups of the bank employees in terms of their degree of job
satisfaction and job involvement.  Thus the results indicate that
computerization of the work might have reduced the work load and fatigue of the
bank employees, to some extent, but it has not necessarily enhanced their job
satisfaction and job involvement.

%X In a number of studies we have investigated communication processes and
communicative outcome in small groups.  One major interest has been differences
and similarities between communication face-to-face and computer-mediated
communication.  One general hypothesis is that the written mode invites to
focus on the messages communicated, whereas the spoken mode invites to
attention not only to what is "said", but also to the social climate and
relationships, including bodily communication.  Stated in a very simplified
way, computer-mediated communication could thus be expected to imply more
"rational" communication and better problem-solving capacities, than
face-to-face communication, since the focus is on the facts and arguments
presented in the written mode.  We have not found any major differences between
the two media with respect to quality of decisions, in accordance with previous
research, but a clear subjective preference for face-to-face communication. 
Altogether, our studies show that the communicative medium should be analyzed
as an integral part of a communication situation, together with other parts,
viz. context, communicative purposes, task requirements and subject
characteristics.

%X Computers are widely used as administrative tools.  Technological
development, including computerization, generally tends to make occupations
more professionalized.  What about technology and managerial
professionalization?  At first sight, it seems a reasonable hypothesis that the
increased sophistication of administrative software (e.g. decision support
systems) will contribute to the professionalization of managers.  However, when
the concept of managerial professionalization is studied more closely such a
development becomes doubtful.  I shall suggest that managerial theory has
developed into a set of strategies and methods for legitimizing organizational
action and that its earlier technical-administrative elements gradually have
been abandoned.  As a consequence the automatization of administrative
functions has only limited relevance for the professionalization of managers.

%X The social work context of Sweden leads to a good environment for research
and for the development of production systems, products, technical aids in
co-operation with management and shop floor workers.  There is a number of
changes going in this direction in Sweden.  More involvement of the workforce
in product-/production development process.  However, the models used by the
Swedish ergonomists and designers emphasise on the application of experience
gained lead to better work condition and better products.  This paper presents
two models used in ergonomic product development in Sweden:
 1 A Systems approach to Product Design and Development
 2 The Ergonomic Design process
The first model is developed by Roland Andersson, it describes the group
development technique through the product development process with emphasis on
ergonomics and participate design.  The second model describe the Ergonomic

%X Both the impact of computer use and the effects of computerization on the
office environment on perceived job characteristics and workers' health were
examined in a sample of 4,400 office workers of the publishing industry in
Japan.  According to Sainfort P. C. (1992), computer system performance had an
indirect effect on workers' stress through its effects on task characteristics.
We conducted a questionnaire survey to test the hypotheses, however, adopted
variables were different from those used by Sainfort: our variables included
environment factors related to office computerization, different aspects of job
characteristics and different health indicators.
   Results showed that the relationships among exposure factors related to
office computerization, perceived job characteristics and effects on workers'
health were stronger in males than in females.  In males, the extent to which
job changes occurred by office computerization, average hours of daily VDT use
had significant effects on perceived job pressure, ability fulfillment and
development, lack of job discretion, job ambiguity and lack of power to
accomplish work, but those effects were relatively weak.  In addition, results
showed that these factors had a direct, though slight, effect on work morale
and overall job satisfaction.  Conclusively, the impact of computerization
within offices on workers' health was mainly mediated by effects on perceived
job characteristics.  Considering effect on worker's well-being and health, it
was found that ability fulfillment and development was the most influential
among the 5 job characteristics in our study.
   That is to say, the hypothesized psycho-social mechanism of the impact of
office computerization on worker's health was supported in general.  Also, we
found a gender difference among the relationships that were examined.

department heads, lawyers, architects, clerical workers and draftsmen were
studied by a questionnaire in a large municipal organization.  The results
presented in this paper are based on the responses of 566 employees.  The
attitude toward computerization was positive, and the majority expected further
development of information technology to affect their future positively.  It
was felt, however, that the capability to use various application softwares was
deficient, and further training was required in all groups.  Design
assistants/draftsmen, architects, and the administrative management required
most training.

%X The present study examined the relationship between work posture and
performance in a video display terminal (VDT) task.  It is generally recognized
that poor working posture is a potential risk factor for musculoskeletal
problems in VDT work (Grandjean, 1987; WHO, 1987).  However, little attention
has been given to the relationship between work posture and performance in VDT
or office tasks.  A laboratory study by Horie et al. (1987) examined posture
and performance at a VDT-based visual search task over a limited period of time
(three hours), and found both a progressive decrement in performance and an
increasing frequency of postural adjustments.  In a study of data entry work,
Delvolve and Queinnec (1983) also observed postural adjustments and fidgets
over time.  Although performance was stable, the increasing adjustments in
posture were accompanied by adjustments in psychomotor aspects of the way the
task was performed.
   The relationship between work posture and performance could be purely
correlational; i.e., the performance decrements might simply be a covariate of
poor posture, with both possibly resulting from fatigue.  Alternatively, it is
possible that poor posture may directly induce fatigue, and thus serve as a
risk factor for performance problems.
   To test these two possibilities in the present study, VDT operators were
videotaped while performing a data entry task.  The tapes were then analyzed to
tag postural indicators of fatigue (i.e., increasing fidgets, cumulative time
in slumped postures, etc.), which were then correlated with performance to test
the covariate hypothesis.  To test the hypothesis that performance may be
causally associated with performance, "fatigue inducing" postures (i.e.,
postures involving static muscle loads) were tagged, accumulated and correlated
with performance.

before the implementation of the new integrated data system, the second survey
(n=73) one year after it, and the third survey (n=43) five years later.  The
results showed a general trend to increased daily amount of VDT work and its
better mastery.  Most of the problems were encountered during the second
survey, one year after the implementation.  The results from the three study
phases seemed to be qualitatively different in the analysis of the relations of
VDT use to job demands and stressors, and well-being.  The selection that
occurred during the follow-up in the study groups also affected the results,
and needs further analysis.

%X Computer monitoring has been a controversial issue because of the distinct
advantages and disadvantages associated with it.  On the positive side, it can
provide immediate and objective performance feedback, facilitate goal setting
and lead to productivity gains.  On the negative side, computer monitoring is
often perceived as an invasion of privacy and as an excessive management
control tool.  It can lead to increased stress and lower job satisfaction among
monitored workers.
   Findings of the six studies reported here demonstrated that computer
monitoring is clearly associated with higher stress levels.  Its effects on
productivity however, are strongly affected by the complexity of the monitored
task; monitoring facilitates simple task performance and impairs complex task
performance.  Computer monitoring with feedback does not appear to be
sufficient for performance gains; goal setting must also be introduced to
produce significant performance improvements.

%X This paper discusses empirical evidence regarding the effect of electronic
performance monitoring on job design and stress.  Data from two studies show
that electronic performance monitoring seems to have an indirect effect on
worker stress via job design.  Monitored employees report more negative
perceptions of their working conditions and, in one of the two studies, more
stress than non-monitored employees.  Specific characteristics of electronic
performance monitoring, such as completeness and comparison of ratings among
co-workers, are related to job design and worker stress.

%X This study examined performance effects of using electronic performance
monitoring (EPM) and feedback to induce compliance with performance standards
in a data-entry task.  The study focused on subjects who had difficulty meeting
or maintaining performance standards.  In an experimental group, EPM and
feedback were used to induce compliance with pre-established speed and accuracy
standards.  In a control group, subjects were unaware of EPM and received no
feedback.  The introduction of EPM work management in the experimental group
led to significant increases in data-entry speed which were accompanied by
significant increases in data-entry errors.  This "speed-accuracy tradeoff"
effect is discussed in terms of relevant research on goal-setting and feedback
utilization.  The results suggest that when performance goals/standards which
emphasize speed more than accuracy are applied in EPM-managed work settings,
speed increments may be offset by decrements in work quality.
