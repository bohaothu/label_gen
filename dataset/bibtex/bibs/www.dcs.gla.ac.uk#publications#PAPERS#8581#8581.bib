Each agent corresponds to a distinct software process, all of which may run concurrently. To be able to work towards a global solution each agent may react to change induced upon it by other agents and is able to negotiate with agents. The external world is treated as an agent with one exceptional property, negotiation is disallowed. The system is disciplined such that problem solving effort can be dynamically focused and decision making synchronized. DAS does not differentiate between prediction and reaction.},keywords = {scheduling; artificial intelligence; decision making; concurrency; DAS (Distributed Asynchronous Scheduler)},Publisher =
