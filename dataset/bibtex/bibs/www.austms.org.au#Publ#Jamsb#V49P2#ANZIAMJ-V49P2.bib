 abstract={Tsuno and Nodera proposed a new variant of the GMRES($m$) algorithm. Their algorithm is referred to as the GMRES($\leqslant \! m_{\max }$) algorithm and performs the restart process adaptively, considering the distribution of the zeros of the residual polynomial. However, unless the zeros of the residual polynomial are distributed uniformly, $m_{\max }$ is always chosen and their algorithm becomes almost the same as the GMRES($m$) algorithm with $m=m_{\max }$. \par In this paper, we include a convergence test for the residual norm in the GMRES($\leqslant \! m_{\max }$) algorithm and propose a new restarting technique based on two criteria. Even if the distribution of zeros does not become uniform, the restart can be performed by using the convergence test of the residual norm. Numerical examples simulated on a Compaq Beowulf computer demonstrate that the proposed technique accelerates the convergence of the GMRES($\leqslant \! m_{\max }$) algorithm. }

The unknown coefficient of the elliptic equations depends on the gradient of the solution and belongs to a set of admissible coefficients.

 abstract={Interior-Point Methods (IPMs) are not only very effective in practice for solving linear optimization problems but also have polynomial-time complexity. Despite the practical efficiency of large-update algorithms, from a theoretical point of view, these algorithms have a weaker iteration bound with respect to small-update algorithms. In fact, there is a significant gap between theory and practice for large-update algorithms. By introducing self-regular barrier functions, Peng, Roos and Terlaky improved this gap up to a factor of $\log n$. However, checking these self-regular functions is not simple and proofs of theorems involving these functions are very complicated. Roos \textit {et al.} by presenting a new class of barrier functions which are not necessarily self-regular, achieved very good results through some much simpler theorems. In this paper we introduce a new kernel function in this class which yields the best known complexity bound, both for large-update and small-update methods. }

We assume the knowledge of a blurred image and its original version. The class of blurring operators is identified in the class of compact operators. A variational method with negative norms is then used for the restoration of a blurred and noised image. The restoration method works for a wide class of blurring operators and we do not assume that the blur operator commutes with the Laplacian. }

 abstract={This paper deals with the optimal tracking problem for switched systems, where the control input, the switching times and the switching index are all design variables. We propose a three-stage method for solving this problem. First, we fix the switching times and switching index sequence, which leads to a linear tracking problem, except different subsystems are defined in their respective time intervals. The optimal control and the corresponding cost function obtained depend on the switching signal. This gives rise to an optimal parameter selection problem for which the switching instants and the switching index are to be chosen optimally. In the second stage, the switching index is fixed. A reverse time transformation followed by a time scaling transform are introduced to convert this subproblem into an equivalent standard optimal parameter selection problem. The gradient formula of the cost function is derived. Then the discrete filled function is used in the third stage to search for the optimal switching index. On this basis, a computational method, which combines a gradient-based method, a local search algorithm and a filled function method, is developed for solving this problem. A numerical example is solved, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. }

First, we consider a domain with periodically distributed holes inside which we impose that the involved functions vanish. There exists a critical size of the holes for which the limit problem has an extra term. For sizes larger than critical the best trace constant diverges to infinity and for sizes smaller than critical it converges to the best constant in the domain without holes. Also, we study the problem with the holes located on the boundary of the domain. In this case another critical exists and its extra term appears on the boundary. }

 abstract={In this paper, finite phase semi-Markov processes are introduced. By introducing variables and a simple transformation, every finite phase semi-Markov process can be transformed to a finite Markov chain which is called its associated Markov chain. A consequence of this is that every phase semi-Markovian switching system may be equivalently expressed as its associated Markovian switching system. Existing results for Markovian switching systems may then be applied to analyze phase semi-Markovian switching systems. In the following, we obtain asymptotic stability for the distribution of nonlinear stochastic systems with semi-Markovian switching. The results can also be extended to general semi-Markovian switching systems. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results obtained. }
