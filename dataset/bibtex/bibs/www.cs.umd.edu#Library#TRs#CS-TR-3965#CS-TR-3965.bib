TITLE:: Does a Sketchy Appearance Influence Drawing Behavior?

ABSTRACT:: 

In this paper we examine the role of visual aesthetics in how people interact 
with computers. Specifically, we are interested in whether simply adopting a 
sketch-like visual appearance in a drawing application encourages users to 
interact with the application more freely or rapidly than they would if they 
were using the standard, precise, rectilinear appearance that most drawing 
applications now supply. We carried out two user studies. In the first
study, we asked members of the University of Maryland Art History
department to draw a series of diagrams using two different line styles. In 
the second experiment, we used the World Wide Web to collect drawing
diagrams from a much broader set of participants. Both studies reveal that 
subjects draw more quickly using the sketch-like ('wavy') line style than the 
straight line style. (Also cross-referenced as UMIACS-TR-98-74)
