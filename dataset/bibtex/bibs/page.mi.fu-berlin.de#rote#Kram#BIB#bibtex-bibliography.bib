The characterization of these mininal elements leads to a generalized set covering problem. The difference to the classical set covering problem is that, instead of taking a given set or not, one can select a set from a given chain of nested sets. We give several algorithms for enumerating the minimal solutions of the generalized set covering problem, all of them exponential in the worst case. When specialized to the set covering problem, the problem of enumerating the minimal solutions is also known as hypergraph dualization. 
For the case of maxmin equations, we derive upper bounds on the number of solutions by using network flow techniques. We also disprove a conjecture of Czogala, Drewniak and Pedrycz (1982) that an $n\times n$ system of maxmin equations has less than $2^n$ minimal solutions. }

Using this transformation we can establish a direct correspondence between two independently developed systolic arrays for solving the algebraic path problem (matrix inversion, shortest paths in a network, transitive closure of a relation). The two systolic arrays are a hexagonal one due to the author and a rectangular one due to Yves Robert and Denis Trystram, ``An orthogonal systolic array for the algebraic path problem'', Computing 39, 187--199. 
Then we derive a new hexagonal array for solving a certain type of dynamic programming recursion that arises for example in context-free language recognition, in the construction of optimal binary search trees, or in the computation of an optimal sequence of multiplications for the evaluation of an associative product. A rectangular array for this problem is due to L. J. Guibas, H. T. Kung, and C. D. Thompson, ``Direct VLSI implementation of combinatorial algorithms'', Proc. CalTech Conference on VLSI. January 1979, pp.756--763. In general, the type of transformation used here allows arbitrary systolic arrays to be transformed into unidirectional ones, which are preferable from the points of view of fault tolerance, two-level pipelining, and algorithm partitioning.}

To compute these, three rules for choosing the supporting points are proposed and it is shown for two of them that the projective distance between inner and outer approximation decreases quadratically with the number of supporting points. These two rules are variations of the Sandwich algorithm. The third rule takes a more local approach. It is a compromise between the adaptive global strategy of the Sandwich algorithm and the usual local left-to-right parametric approach for computing the efficient point curve. 
This method is applied to approximate the efficient point curve of the bicriteria minimum cost flow problem, which is a piecewise linear convex curve that may have an exponential number of breakpoints in the worst case. 
It turns out that the left-to-right rule is better from a computational viewpoint, since is tries to avoid large changes in the parameters when solving successive minimum cost flow problems.}

We describe the relation among these problems and their common algebraic foundation. We survey algorithms for solving them: vertex elimination algorithms such as Gau\ss{}-Jordan elimination; and iterative algorithms such as the {\it classical\/} Jacobi and Gau\ss{}-Seidel iteration. }

Finally, we deal with constrained problems where the wanted path has to fulfill additional properties; in particular, if it has to pass straight through a further point, we show that the length of such a constrained polygonal path is a strictly convex function of some parameter angle, and we derive an algorithm for determining such constrained polygonal paths efficiently.}

We characterize all shortest paths of the line segment moving in free space when we measure the average orbit length of the two endpoints. 
This problem of optimal motion has been solved by Gurevich and also by Dubovitskij, who calls it Ulam's problem. Unlike previous solutions, our basic tool is Cauchy's surface-area formula. This new approach is relatively elementary, and yields new insights.}

There are polynomial algorithms when the number of permutation matrices in a decomposition is allowed to be as large as $n^2$. When the number of matrices is restricted to $n$, the problem is NP-hard. In this paper we propose a heuristic based on a scaling technique which for each number of allowed matrices in the range from $n$ to $n^2$ allows to give a performance guarantee with respect to the total weight of the solution. As a subroutine we use new heuristics methods for decomposing a matrix of small integers into as few matrices as possible without exceeding the lower bound on the total weight. Computational results indicate that the method might also be practical.}

We present an algorithm that computes the link distance (and a corresponding minimum-link path) between two points in time $O(E \alpha (n) \log ^2 n)$ and space $O(E)$, where $n$ is the total number of edges of the obstacles, $E$ is the size of the visibility graph, and $\alpha (n)$ denotes the extremely slowly growing inverse of Ackermann's function. We show how to extend our method to allow computation of a tree (rooted at $s$) of minimum-link paths from $s$ to all obstacle vertices. This leads to a method of solving the query version of our problem (for query points $t$).}

In general, the dispersion of a point set with respect to various classes of range spaces, like balls, squares, triangles, axis-parallel and arbitrary rectangles, spherical caps and slices, is the area of the largest empty range, and it is a measure for the distribution of the points. The main purpose of our paper is to give a survey about this topic, including some folklore results. Furthermore, we prove several properties of the dispersion, generalizing investigations of Niederreiter and others concerning balls. For several well-known uniformly distributed point sets we estimate the dispersion with respect to triangles, and we also compare them computationally. For the dispersion with respect to spherical slices we mention an application to the polygonal approximation of curves in space.}

We show that the answer is positive, by constructing uncountably many families of functions satisfying all properties. We show also that there are no other solutions. Our method establishes connections with webs (nets) and iteration groups. This may be of interest both in itself and for applications.}

The focus of our paper is the general study of reference points (like the Steiner point) and their properties with respect to shape matching. For more general transformations than just translations, our method eliminates several degrees of freedom from the problem and thus yields good matchings with improved time bounds.}

This restricted version is called the Anti-Monge--Toeplitz QAP. There are three well-known combinatorial problems that can be modeled via the Anti-Monge--Toeplitz QAP: (P1) The ``Turbine Problem'', i. e., the assignment of given masses to the vertices of a regular polygon such that the distance of the center of gravity of the resulting system to the center of the polygon is minimized. (P2) The Traveling Salesman Problem on symmetric Monge distance matrices. (P3) The arrangement of data records with given access probabilities in a linear storage medium in order to minimize the average access time. 
We identify conditions on the Toeplitz matrix that lead to a simple solution for the Anti-Monge--Toeplitz QAP: The optimal permutation can be given in advance without regarding the numerical values of the data. The resulting theorems generalize and unify several known results on problems (P1), (P2), and (P3). We also show that the Turbine Problem is NP-hard and consequently, that the Anti-Monge--Toeplitz QAP is NP-hard in general.}

The complexity of this problem has been unclear for thirty years. The only algorithm known for its solution involves a reduction to integer linear programming, due to Karp (1961). 
In this paper we introduce a dynamic programming solution to the problem. It optimally encodes $n$ words in $O(n^{C+2})$ time, if the costs of the letters are integers between 1 and $C$. While still leaving open the question of whether the general problem is solvable in polynomial time our algorithm seems to be the first one that runs in polynomial time for fixed letter costs. 
Some numerical results are reported, including solutions using Karp's integer programming formulations, which was solved using AMPL and CPLEX. The AMPL model is included in the appendix and in the PostScript-file.}

We have $n$ cans of fuel on the edge of a desert and a jeep whose tank can hold the contents of one can. The jeep can carry one can in addition the fuel in its tank, and therefore it can establish depots in the desert for later use. When a can is opened, the fuel must immediately be filled into the jeep's tank. The goal is to find the farthest point in the desert which the jeep can reach. 
We give a simple algorithm for the jeep which improves previous solutions of Derick Wood [1984] and Ute and Wilfried Brauer [1989], and we use a linear programming formulation to derive an upper bound which shows that our solution is optimal.}

It decomposes the greedy triangulation into levels, and the number $k$ of levels allows us to bound the total edge length by $3\cdot 2^{k+1}$ times the minimum-weight triangulation of the point set. }

The first one is $2(d-1)!+2(d-1)$, which is the best one currently known for small dimensions, while the second one, $O((d-2)!)$, is the best bound for large dimensions. 
This question was posed by G\"unter Ziegler in his book ``Lectures on Polytopes'' (1995) (exercise 0.15). Our bounds improve the best previously known bound of $O(d!)$, which follows from a simple volume argument due to Imre B\'ar\'any. The known lower bounds are exponential, the current record being $3.6^d$ for large enough $d$. (Thomas Christof and Gerhard Reinelt 1997). They follow from explicit polytopes in low dimensions. (Since the paper was published, superexponential lower bounds were proved by B\'ar\'any and Por.) 
We also prove bounds for the number of faces of lower dimensions, and for integral convex polytopes with coordinates between 0 and $k$.}

This result is achieved in two steps. First we prove that the the classical Gaussian algorithm for ternary form reduction, in the variant of Lagarias, has this worst case running time. Then we show that, given a ternary form which is reduced in the Gaussian sense, it takes only a constant number of arithmetic operations and a constant number of binary-form reductions to fully reduce the form.  Finally we describe how this algorithm can be generalized to higher dimensions. Lattice basis reduction and shortest vector computation in fixed dimension $d$ can be done with $O(M(s)\log ^{d-1} s)$ bit-operations. }

Thus, when the number of constraints is fixed, integer programming in two variables is not harder than greatest common divisor computation. Our algorithm avoids the binary search that is associated with the usual approach by letting the objective function slide into the polyhedron, until the lattice width of the truncated polyhedron equals the flatness constant from Khintchin's Flatness theorem. }

Its $1$-skeleton is the graph whose vertices are the pointed pseudo-triangulations of the point set and whose edges are flips of interior pseudo-triangulation edges. 
For points in convex position we obtain a new realization of the associahedron, i.e., a geometric representation of the set of triangulations of an $n$-gon, or of the set of binary trees on $n$ vertices, or of many other combinatorial objects that are counted by the Catalan numbers. By considering the $1$-dimensional version of the polytope of constrained expansive motions we obtain a second distinct realization of the associahedron as a perturbation of the positive cell in a Coxeter arrangement. 
Our methods produce as a by-product a new proof that every simple polygon or polygonal arc in the plane has expansive motions, a key step in the proofs of the Carpenter's Rule Theorem by Connelly, Demaine and Rote (2000) and by Streinu (2000). }

In this paper we prove that the opposite statement is also true, namely that planar minimally rigid graphs always admit pointed embeddings, even under certain natural topological and combinatorial constraints. The proofs yield efficient embedding algorithms. They also provide the first algorithmically effective result on graph embeddings with oriented matroid constraints other than convexity of faces. These constraints are described by {\it combinatorial pseudo-triangulations\/}, first defined and studied in this paper. Also of interest are our two proof techniques, one based on Henneberg inductive constructions from combinatorial rigidity theory, the other on a generalization of Tutte's barycentric embeddings to directed graphs.}

We give a complete description of the self-stresses on non-crossing frameworks $G$ whose reciprocals are non-crossing, in terms of: the types of faces (only pseudo-triangles and pseudo-quadrangles are allowed); the sign patterns in the stress on $G$; and a geometric condition on the stress vectors at some of the vertices. 
As in other recent papers where the interplay of non-crossingness and rigidity of straight-line plane graphs is studied, pseudo-triangulations show up as objects of special interest. For example, it is known that all planar Laman circuits can be embedded as a pseudo-triangulation with one non-pointed vertex. We show that for such pseudo-triangulation embeddings of planar Laman circuits which are sufficiently generic, the reciprocal is non-crossing and again a pseudo-triangulation embedding of a planar Laman circuit. For a singular (non-generic) pseudo-triangulation embedding of a planar Laman circuit, the reciprocal is still non-crossing and a pseudo-triangulation, but its underlying graph may not be a Laman circuit. Moreover, all the pseudo-triangulations which admit a non-crossing reciprocal arise as the reciprocals of such, possibly singular, stresses on pseudo-triangulation Laman circuits. 
All self-stresses on a planar graph correspond to liftings to piece-wise linear surfaces in 3-space. We prove characteristic geometric properties of the lifts of such non-crossing reciprocal pairs.}

In contrast, we show that the problem is tractable---indeed, solvable in linear time on a real RAM---for planar embeddings of planar 3-connected triangulations, even if the outer face is not a triangle. This result is essentially tight: the problem becomes NP-hard if we consider instead planar embeddings of planar 3-connected infinitesimally rigid graphs, a natural relaxation of triangulations in this context. }

The maximum detour over all pairs of points is called the geometric dilation. Ebbers-Baumann, Gr{\"u}ne and Klein have shown that every finite point set is contained in a planar graph whose geometric dilation is at most 1.678, and some point sets require graphs with dilation $\ge \pi /2 = 1.57\ldots $. We prove a stronger lower bound of $1.00000000001*\pi /2$ by relating graphs with small dilation to a problem of packing and covering the plane by circular disks.
The proof relies on halving pairs, pairs of points dividing a given closed curve $C$ in two parts of equal length, and their minimum and maximum distances $h$ and $H$. Additionally, we analyze curves of constant halving distance ($h=H$), examine the relation of $h$ to other geometric quantities and geometric problems (like Ulam's floating body problem) and prove some new dilation bounds.}

,  abstract = {We extend linkage unfolding results from the well-studied case of polygonal linkages to the more general case of linkages of polygons. More precisely, we consider chains of nonoverlapping rigid planar shapes (Jordan regions) that are hinged together sequentially at rotatable joints. Our goal is to characterize the familes of planar shapes that admit locked chains, where some configurations cannot be reached by continuous reconfiguration without self-intersection, and which families of planar shapes guarantee universal foldability, where every chain is guaranteed to have a connected configuration space. Previously, only obtuse triangles were known to admit locked shapes, and only line segments were known to guarantee universal foldability. We show that a surprisingly general family of planar shapes, called slender adornments, guarantees universal foldability: roughly, the inward normal from any point on the shape's boundary should intersect the line segment connecting the two incident hinges. In constrast, we show that isosceles triangles with any desired apex angle less than 90 degrees admit locked chains, which is precisely the threshold beyond which the inward-normal property no longer holds.}

We study the following shape matching problem: Given two weighted point sets $A$ and $B$ in the plane, compute a rigid motion of $A$ that minimizes its Earth Mover's Distance to $B$. No algorithm is known that computes an exact solution to this problem. We present simple FPTASs and polynomial-time $(2 + \varepsilon )$-approximation algorithms for the minimum Euclidean EMD between $A$ and $B$ under translations and rigid motions.}

In computer-aided manufacturing environments, the paths of cutting tools are usually described with circular arcs and straight line segments. Greedy algorithms for approximating a polygonal curve with curves of higher order can be found in the literature. Without theoretical bounds it is difficult to say anything about the quality of these algorithms. We present an algorithm which finds a series of circular arcs that approximate the polygonal curve while remaining within a given tolerance region. This series contains the minimum number of arcs of any such series. Our algorithm takes $ O (n^2 \log n)$ time for an original polygonal chain with $n$ vertices. 
Using a similar approach, we design an algorithm with a runtime of $ O (n^2 \log n)$, for computing a tangent-continuous approximation with the minimum number of biarcs, for a sequence of points with given tangent directions.}

Our algorithm is a scaling algorithm. It solves a sequence of more and more refined discretizations. The discretizations are minimum-cost network flow problems with convex piecewise linear costs. These discretizations are interesting in their own right because they arise in proportional elections.}

The embedding will need no coordinate greater than $O(2^{7.55n})=O(188^n)$. Finding a plane embedding which supports an equilibrium stress is the crucial part in the construction. We have to guarantee that the size of the coordinates and the stresses are small. This is achieved by extending Tutte's spring embedding method. }

The popularity of this heuristic lies in its speed, easy implementation and in the fact that usually, PCA bounding boxes approximate the minimum-volume bounding boxes quite well. 
There are examples of discrete points sets in the plane showing that the worst case ratio tends to infinity. Thus, we consider PCA bounding boxes for continuous sets, especially for the convex hull of a point set. We contribute new upper bounds on the approximation factor of PCA bounding boxes of convex sets in $\mathbb {R}^2$ and $\mathbb {R}^3$.}

In contrast to surface reconstruction we do not use all the sample points, but we try to use as few points as possible. Such a polytope $P$ is useful as a {\it seed polytope\/} for starting an incremental refinement procedure to generate better and better approximations of $F$ based on interpolating subdivision surfaces or e.g.\ B\'ezier patches. 
Our algorithm starts from an {\it $r$-sample\/} $S$ of $F$. Based on $S$, a set of surface covering balls with maximal radii is calculated such that the topology is retained. From the weighted $\alpha $-shape of a proper subset of these highly overlapping surface balls we get the desired polytope. As there is a rather large range for the possible radii for the surface balls, the method can be used to construct triangular surfaces from point clouds in a scalable manner. We also briefly sketch how to combine parts of our algorithm with existing medial axis algorithms for balls, in order to compute stable medial axis approximations with scalable level of detail.}

The complexity depends on geometric quantities that represent the hardness of the computation in a natural way, like the angle of the intersection. The main idea is the application of the super-composition technique, which considers unions of adjacent parameter intervals that are not siblings in the subdivision tree. This approach addresses the common difficulty of non-termination of the classical subdivision approach when the intersection coincides with a subdivision point, but it avoids the numerical overhead associated to alternative methods like a random shift of the parameter.}

Specifically, we show that we can always find a plane tree, a two-connected outerplanar graph, or a pointed pseudotriangulation that satisfies all but at most three parity constraints.

For a given set of forces we ask for a non-crossing geometric graph on the points $p_i$ that has the following property: there exists a weight assignment to the edges of the graph, such that for every $p_i$ the sum of the weighted edges (seen as vectors) around $p_i$ yields $-f_i$. As additional constraint we restrict ourselves to weights that are non-negative on every edge that is not on the convex hull of the point set. We show that (under a generic assumption) for any reasonable set of forces there is exactly one pointed pseudo-triangulation that fulfils the desired properties. Our results will be obtained by linear programming duality over the PPT-polytope. For the case where the forces appear only at convex hull vertices we show that the pseudo-triangulation that resolves the load can be computed as weighted Delaunay triangulation. Our observations lead to a new characterization of pointed pseudo-triangulations, structures that have been proven to be extremely useful in the design and analysis of efficient geometric algorithms. 
As an application, we discuss how to compute the maximal locally convex function for a polygon whose corners lie on its convex hull. Our studies are motivated by the construction of discrete Laplace-Beltrami operators. }

,  abstract = {We present an algorithm for constructing the Delaunay triangulation of $n$ given points in the plane. It runs in $O(n^2)$ time using only constant working space (more precisely, $O(\log n)$ bits in total) with input data on a read-only array. We apply it to construct the Voronoi diagram in $O(n^2)$ time and Euclidean minimum spanning tree in $O(n^3)$ time in the same model.}

,  abstract = {An {\it $n$-town}, for a natural number $n$, is a group of $n$ buildings, each occupying a distinct position on a 2-dimensional integer grid. If we measure the distance between two buildings along the axis-parallel street grid, then an $n$-town has optimal shape if the sum of all pairwise Manhattan distances is minimized. This problem has been studied for {\it cities}, i.e., the limiting case of very large $n$. The optimal shape can be described by a differential equation. No closed-form solution is known. We show that optimal $n$-towns can be computed in $O(n^{7.5})$ time. This is also practically useful, as it allows us to compute optimal solutions up to $n=80$. }

,  abstract = {A line $g$ is a transversal to a family $F$ of convex polytopes in 3-dimensional space if it intersects every member of $F$. If, in addition, $g$ is an isolated point of the space of line transversals to $F$, we say that $F$ is a pinning of $g$. We show that any minimal pinning of a line by convex polytopes such that no face of a polytope is coplanar with the line has size at most eight. If, in addition, the polytopes are disjoint, then it has size at most six. We completely characterize configurations of disjoint polytopes that form minimal pinnings of a line.}

We show that when $B$ can only be translated along a line, there can be at most $m(n-m)+1$ different matchings as $B$ moves along the line, and hence the optimal translation can be found in polynomial time.}
