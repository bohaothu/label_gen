  abstract = {We discuss model-free analysis of multisubject or multisession FMRI
	data by extending the single-session probabilistic independent component
	analysis model (PICA; Beckmann and Smith, 2004. IEEE Trans. on Medical
	Imaging, 23 (2) 137-152) to higher dimensions. This results in a
	three-way decomposition that represents the different signals and
	artefacts present in the data in terms of their temporal, spatial,
	and subject-dependent variations. The technique is derived from and
	compared with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC; Harshman and Lundy,
	1984. In Research methods for multimode data analysis, chapter 5,
	pages 122-215. Praeger, New York). Using simulated data as well as
	data from multisession and multisubject FMRI studies we demonstrate
	that the tensor PICA approach is able to efficiently and accurately
	extract signals of interest in the spatial, temporal, and subject/session
	domain. The final decompositions improve upon PARAFAC results in
	terms of greater accuracy, reduced interference between the different
	estimated sources (reduced cross-talk), robustness (against deviations
	of the data from modeling assumptions and against overfitting), and
	computational speed. On real FMRI 'activation' data, the tensor PICA
	approach is able to extract plausible activation maps, time courses,
	and session/subject modes as well as provide a rich description of
	additional processes of interest such as image artefacts or secondary
	activation patterns. The resulting data decomposition gives simple
	and useful representations of multisubject/multisession FMRI data
	that can aid the interpretation and optimization of group FMRI studies
	beyond what can be achieved using model-based analysis techniques.},

	(fMRI). Regions belonging to such networks are defined as sets of
	strongly interacting regions, each of which showing a homogeneous
	temporal activity. Our method of large-scale network identification
	(LSNI) proceeds by first detecting functionally homogeneous regions.
	The networks of functional interconnections are then found by comparing
	the correlations among these regions against a model of the correlations
	in the noise. To test the LSNI method, we first evaluated its specificity
	and sensitivity on synthetic data sets. Then, the method was applied
	to four real data sets with a block-designed motor task. The LSNI
	method correctly recovered the regions whose temporal activity was
	locked to the stimulus. In addition, it detected two other main networks
	highly reproducible across subjects, whose activity was dominated
	by slow fluctuations (0-0.1 Hz). One was located in medial and dorsal
	regions, and mostly overlapped the "default" network of the brain
	at rest [Greicius, M.D., Krasnow, B., Reiss, A.L., Menon, V., 2003.
	Functional connectivity in the resting brain: a network analysis
	of the default mode hypothesis. Proceedings of the National Academy
	of Sciences of the U.S.A. 100, 253-258]; the other was composed of
	lateral frontal and posterior parietal regions. The LSNI method we
	propose allows to detect in an exploratory and systematic way all
	the regions and large-scale networks activated in the working brain.},

  abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising analysis method
	that is being increasingly applied to fMRI data. A principal advantage
	of this approach is its applicability to cognitive paradigms for
	which detailed models of brain activity are not available. Independent
	component analysis has been successfully utilized to analyze single-subject
	fMRI data sets, and an extension of this work would be to provide
	for group inferences. However, unlike univariate methods (e.g., regression
	analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics), ICA does not naturally
	generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences about groups
	of subjects. We introduce a novel approach for drawing group inferences
	using ICA of fMRI data, and present its application to a simple visual
	paradigm that alternately stimulates the left or right visual field.
	Our group ICA analysis revealed task-related components in left and
	right visual cortex, a transiently task-related component in bilateral
	occipital/parietal cortex, and a non-task-related component in bilateral
	visual association cortex. We address issues involved in the use
	of ICA as an fMRI analysis method such as: (1) How many components
	should be calculated? (2) How are these components to be combined
	across subjects? (3) How should the final results be thresholded
	and/or presented? We show that the methodology we present provides
	answers to these questions and lay out a process for making group
	inferences from fMRI data using independent component analysis.},

	It has been hypothesized that not only regional changes, but also

	we examined the functional properties of brain networks based on
	spontaneous fluctuations within brain systems using functional magnetic

	intrinsic brain activity in the "default-mode" network (DMN) is affected
	by normal aging and that this relates to cognitive function. Ten
	younger and 22 older subjects were scanned at "rest," that is, lying
	awake with eyes closed. Our results show decreased activity in older
	versus younger subjects in 2 resting-state networks (RSNs) resembling
	the previously described DMN, containing the superior and middle
	frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and the
	superior parietal region. These results remain significant after
	correction for RSN-specific gray matter volume. The relevance of
	these findings is illustrated by the correlation between reduced

	of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the
	blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reflect
	the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state
	of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action
	and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to
	functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on
	resting fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity
	between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these
	resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified.
	In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic
	independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data to find
	coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We
	characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using
	a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation
	as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found
	10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions
	known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive
	functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode
	network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas
	with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the
	least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline
	activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant
	temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable
	with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear
	input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to
	the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the
	implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters
	that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2)
	parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and
	(3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that
	coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known,
	deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We
	developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity
	using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this
	context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity
	and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced
	by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI
	experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration
	among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time
	or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations
	or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of
	effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes
	in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike
	previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses
	to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as
	unknown and stochastic.},

	brain have suggested that low-frequency fluctuations in resting fMRI
	data collected using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast
	correspond to functionally relevant resting state networks (RSNs).
	Whether the fluctuations of resting fMRI signal in RSNs are a direct
	consequence of neocortical neuronal activity or are low-frequency
	artifacts due to other physiological processes (e.g., autonomically
	driven fluctuations in cerebral blood flow) is uncertain. In order
	to investigate further these fluctuations, we have characterized
	their spatial and temporal properties using probabilistic independent
	component analysis (PICA), a robust approach to RSN identification.
	Here, we provide evidence that: i. RSNs are not caused by signal
	artifacts due to low sampling rate (aliasing); ii. they are localized
	primarily to the cerebral cortex; iii. similar RSNs also can be identified
	in perfusion fMRI data; and iv. at least 5 distinct RSN patterns
	are reproducible across different subjects. The RSNs appear to reflect
	"default" interactions related to functional networks related to
	those recruited by specific types of cognitive processes. RSNs are
	a major source of non-modeled signal in BOLD fMRI data, so a full
	understanding of their dynamics will improve the interpretation of
	functional brain imaging studies more generally. Because RSNs reflect
	interactions in cognitively relevant functional networks, they offer
	a new approach to the characterization of state changes with pathology
	and the effects of drugs.},

	demonstrate the practical relevance of partial correlation analysis

	How good is good enough in path analysis of fMRI data? NeuroImage
	11, 289-301]. Specifically, we show that partial correlation analysis
	can serve several purposes. In a pre-processing step, it can hint
	at which effective connections are structuring the interactions and
	which have little influence on the pattern of connectivity. As a
	post-processing step, it can be used both as a simple and visual
	way to check the validity of SEM optimization algorithms and to show
	which assumptions made by the model are valid, and which ones should
	be further modified to better fit the data.},

	requires the determination of three distinct levels of information:
	(1) the regions involved in the process and forming the spatial support

	each pair of regions, and (3) the directionality of the existing
	interactions. While many methods exist to select regions (Step 1),
	very little is available to complete Step 2. The two main methods
	developed so far, structural equation modeling (SEM) and dynamical

	method to deal with Step 2 and extract functional interactions from
	fMRI datasets through partial correlations. Partial correlation is
	more closely related to effective connectivity than marginal correlation
	and provides a convenient graphical representation for functional
	interactions. As an instance of brain interactivity investigation,
	we consider how simple hand movements are processed by the bihemispheric

	We propose a new automatic method called CORSICA (CORrection of Structured

	on the spatial localization of the main physiological fluctuations
	in fMRI data. As opposed to existing spectral priors, which may be
	subject to aliasing effects for long-TR data sets (typically acquired
	with TR >1 s), such spatial priors can be applied to fMRI data, regardless
	of the TR of the acquisitions. By comparing the proposed automatic
	selection to a manual selection performed visually by a human operator,
	we first show that CORSICA is able to identify the noise-related
	components for long-TR data with a high sensitivity and a specificity
	of 1. On short-TR data sets, we validate that the proposed method
	of noise reduction allows a substantial improvement of the signal-to-noise

  abstract = { Independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising method that is
	increasingly used to analyze brain imaging data such as functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI, and electroencephalography
	and has also proved useful for group comparison, e.g., differentiating
	healthy controls from patients. An advantage of ICA is its ability
	to identify components that are mixed in an unknown manner. However,
	ICA is not necessarily robust and optimal in identifying between-group
	effects, especially in highly noisy situations. Here, we propose
	a modified ICA framework for multigroup data analysis that incorporates
	prior information regarding group membership as a constraint into
	the mixing coefficients. Our approach, called coefficient-constrained
	ICA (CC-ICA), prioritizes identification of components that show
	a significant group difference. The performance of CC-ICA via synthetic
	and hybrid data simulations is evaluated under different hypothesis
	testing assumptions and signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Group analysis
	is also conducted on real multitask fMRI data. Results show that
	CC-ICA improves the estimation accuracy of the independent components
	greatly, especially those that have different patterns for different
	groups (e.g., patients vs. controls); In addition, it enhances the
	data extraction sensitivity to group differences by ranking components
	with P value or J-divergence more consistently with the ground truth.
	The proposed algorithm performs quite well for both group-difference
	detection and multitask fMRI data fusion, which may prove especially
	important for the identification of relevant disease biomarkers.},

	high-resolution T1 volume provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute
	(MNI) (D. L. Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468)
	was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated
	and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical
	volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was
	performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following
	of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were
	then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial
	slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were
	reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method,
	three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of
	functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined
	by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each
	of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates,
	and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected
	by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric
	Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum.
	Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers
	of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement
	for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling
	assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are
	well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more
	sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic
	probabilistic maps.},

	circuits that are the basis of the brain's computations, with hope
	that functional neuroimaging techniques will allow the in vivo study
	of these neural processes through the statistical analysis of the

	multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modelling should allow the identification
	of effective connectivity by combining graphical modelling methods
	with the concept of Granger causality. Unfortunately, current time-series
	methods perform well only for the case that the length of the time-series
	Nt is much larger than p, the number of brain sites studied, which
	is exactly the reverse of the situation in neuroimaging for which
	relatively short time-series are measured over thousands of voxels.
	Methods are introduced for dealing with this situation by using sparse
	MAR models. These can be estimated in a two-stage process involving
	(i) penalized regression and (ii) pruning of unlikely connections
	by means of the local false discovery rate developed by Efron. Extensive
	simulations were performed with idealized cortical networks having
	small world topologies and stable dynamics. These show that the detection

title = {Predicting human resting-state functional connectivity from structural connectivity},
abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI ( fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural ( anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks-including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time-can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity ( using fMRI) and structural connectivity ( using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

The method does not rely on a priori specification of a model that contains pre-selected regions and connections between them. This distinguishes it from other fMRI effective connectivity approaches that aim at testing or contrasting specific hypotheses about neuronal interactions. Instead, GCM relies on the concept of Granger causality to define the existence and direction of influence from information in the data. Temporal precedence information is exploited to compute Granger causality maps that identify voxels that are sources or targets of directed influence for any selected region-of-interest. We investigated the method by simulations and by application to fMRI data of a complex visuomotor task. The presented exploratory approach of mapping influences between a region of interest and the rest of the brain can form a useful complement to existing models of effective connectivity.},

title = {Tensorial extensions of independent component analysis for multi-subject fMRI analysis},
abstract = {We discuss model-free analysis of multisubject or multisession FMRI data by extending the single-session probabilistic independent component analysis model (PICA; Beckmann and Smith, 2004. IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging, 23 (2) 137-152) to higher dimensions. This results in a three-way decomposition that represents the different signals and artefacts present in the data in terms of their temporal, spatial, and subject-dependent variations. The technique is derived from and compared with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC; Harshman and Lundy, 1984. In Research methods for multimode data analysis, chapter 5, pages 122-215. Praeger, New York). Using simulated data as well as data from multisession and multisubject FMRI studies we demonstrate that the tensor PICA approach is able to efficiently and accurately extract signals of interest in the spatial, temporal, and subject/session domain. The final decompositions improve upon PARAFAC results in terms of greater accuracy, reduced interference between the different estimated sources (reduced cross-talk), robustness (against deviations of the data from modeling assumptions and against overfitting), and computational speed. On real FMRI 'activation' data, the tensor PICA approach is able to extract plausible activation maps, time courses, and session/subject modes as well as provide a rich description of additional processes of interest such as image artefacts or secondary activation patterns. The resulting data decomposition gives simple and useful representations of multisubject/multisession FMRI data that can aid the interpretation and optimization of group FMRI studies beyond what can be achieved using model-based analysis techniques.},

title = {A global geometric framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction},
abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

abstract = {Structurally segregated and functionally specialized regions of the human cerebral cortex are interconnected by a dense network of cortico-cortical axonal pathways. By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively mapped these pathways within and across cortical hemispheres in individual human participants. An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.},

title = {Multi-atlas based segmentation of brain images: atlas selection and its effect on accuracy},
abstract = {Quantitative research in neuroimaging often relies on anatomical segmentation of human brain MR images. Recent multi-atlas based approaches provide highly accurate structural segmentations of the brain by propagating manual delineations from multiple atlases in a database to a query subject and combining them. The atlas databases which can be used for these purposes are growing steadily. We present a framework to address the consequent problems of scale in multi-atlas segmentation. We show that selecting a custom subset of atlases for each query subject provides more accurate subcortical segmentations than those given by non-selective combination of random atlas subsets. Using a database of 275 atlases, we tested an image-based similarity criterion as well as a demographic criterion (age) in a leave-one-out cross-validation study. Using a custom ranking of the database for each subject, we combined a varying number n of atlases from the top of the ranked list. The resulting segmentations were compared with manual reference segmentations using Dice overlap. Image-based selection provided better segmentations than random subsets (mean Dice overlap 0.854 vs. 0.811 for the estimated optimal subset size, n=20). Age-based selection resulted in a similar marked improvement. We conclude that selecting atlases from large databases for atlas-based brain image segmentation improves the accuracy of the segmentations achieved. We show that image similarity is a suitable selection criterion and give results based on selecting atlases by age that demonstrate the value of meta-information for selection.},

title = {The global signal and observed anticorrelated resting state brain networks},
abstract = {Resting state studies of spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI (fMRI) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal have shown great promise in mapping the brain's intrinsic, large-scale functional architecture. An important data preprocessing step used to enhance the quality of these observations has been removal of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations common to the whole brain (the so-called global signal). One reproducible consequence of global signal removal has been the finding that spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in the default mode network and an extended dorsal attention system are consistently anticorrelated, a relationship that these two systems exhibit during task performance. The dependence of these resting-state anticorrelations on global signal removal has raised important questions regarding the nature of the global signal, the validity of global signal removal, and the appropriate interpretation of observed anticorrelated brain networks. In this study, we investigate several properties of the global signal and find that it is, indeed, global, not residing preferentially in systems exhibiting anticorrelations. We detail the influence of global signal removal on resting state correlation maps both mathematically and empirically, showing an enhancement in detection of system-specific correlations and improvement in the correspondence between resting-state correlations and anatomy. Finally, we show that several characteristics of anticorrelated networks including their spatial distribution, cross-subject consistency, presence with modified whole brain masks, and existence before global regression are not attributable to global signal removal and therefore suggest a biological basis.},

title = {Regression Shrinkage and Selection via the Lasso},
abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

title = {Does the brain have a baseline? Why we should be resisting a rest},
abstract = {In the last few years, the notion that the brain has a default or intrinsic mode of functioning has received increasing attention. The idea derives from observations that a consistent network of brain regions shows high levels of activity when no explicit task is performed and participants are asked simply to rest. The importance of this putative "default mode" is asserted on the basis of the substantial energy demand associated with such a resting state and of the suggestion that rest entails a finely tuned balance between metabolic demand and regionally regulated blood supply. These observations, together with the fact that the default network is more active at rest than it is in a range of explicit tasks, have led some to suggest that it reflects an absolute baseline, one that must be understood and used if we are to develop a comprehensive picture of brain functioning. Here, we examine the assumptions that are generally made in accepting the importance of the "default mode". We question the value, and indeed the interpretability, of the study of the resting state and suggest that observations made under resting conditions have no privileged status as a fundamental metric of brain functioning. In doing so, we challenge the utility of studies of the resting state in a number of important domains of research.},

abstract = {When we fall asleep, consciousness fades yet the brain remains active. Why is this so? To investigate whether changes in cortical information transmission play a role, we used. transcranial magnetic stimulation together with high-density electroencephalography and asked how the activation of one cortical area (the premotor area) is transmitted to the rest of the brain. During quiet wakefulness, an initial response.(similar to 15 milliseconds) at the stimulation site was followed by a sequence of waves that moved to connected cortical areas several centimeters away. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, the initial response was stronger but was rapidly extinguished and did not propagate beyond the stimulation site. Thus, the fading of consciousness during certain stages of steep may be related to a breakdown in cortical effective connectivity.},

title = {An investigation of functional and anatomical connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging},
abstract = {This article examines functional and anatomical connectivity in healthy human subjects measured with magnetic resonance imaging methods. Anatomical connectivity in white matter is obtained from measurements of the diffusion tensor. A Monte-Carlo simulation determines the probability that a particle diffuses between two points, with the probability of a jump in a particular direction from a given voxel being based on the local value of the diffusion tensor components. Functional connectivity between grey matter pixels is assessed without recourse to a specific activation paradigm, by calculating the correlation coefficient between random fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal time course in different pixels. The methods are used to examine the anatomical and functional connectivities between crowns of adjacent gyri. A high functional connectivity was found between grey matter pixels, with white matter displaying only very low correlation. A comparison of the measurements of anatomical and functional connectivity found that there is no simple correlation between these measures, except that low values of functional connectivity were not found together with high values of anatomical connectivity. Furthermore pairs of regions situated around the central sulcus indicated a dependence of the two connectivity measures on each other. These results are in accordance with an interpretation that regions which are clearly directly linked by white matter fiber tracts should show high functional connectivity, but that the inverse need not be true as functional connectivity may also be indirectly mediated via more distant grey matter regions.

title = {Breakdown in cortical effective connectivity during midazolam-induced loss of consciousness},
abstract = {By employing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with high-density electroencephalography (EEG), we recently reported that cortical effective connectivity is disrupted during early non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. This is a time when subjects, if awakened, may report little or no conscious content. We hypothesized that a similar breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may underlie loss of consciousness (LOC) induced by pharmacologic agents. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing EEG responses to TMS during wakefulness and LOC induced by the benzodiazepine midazolam. Unlike spontaneous sleep states, a subject's level of vigilance can be monitored repeatedly during pharmacological LOC. We found that, unlike during wakefulness, wherein TMS triggered responses in multiple cortical areas lasting for > 300 ms, during midazolam-induced LOC, TMS-evoked activity was local and of shorter duration. Furthermore, a measure of the propagation of evoked cortical currents (significant current scattering, SCS) could reliably discriminate between consciousness and LOC. These results resemble those observed in early NREM sleep and suggest that a breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may be a common feature of conditions characterized by LOC. Moreover, these results suggest that it might be possible to use TMS-EEG to assess consciousness during anesthesia and in pathological conditions, such as coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state.},

title = {Information Communication Networks in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury},
abstract = {In this study we explored the use of coherence and Granger causality (GC) to separate patients in minimally conscious state (MCS) from patients with severe neurocognitive disorders (SND) that show signs of awareness. We studied 16 patients, 7 MCS and 9 SND with age between 18 and 49 years. Three minutes of ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was obtained at rest from 19 standard scalp locations, while subjects were alert but kept their eyes closed. GC was formulated in terms of linear autoregressive models that predict the evolution of several EEG time series, each representing the activity of one channel. The entire network of causally connected brain areas can be summarized as a graph of incompletely connected nodes. The 19 channels were grouped into five gross anatomical regions, frontal, left and right temporal, central, and parieto-occipital, while data analysis was performed separately in each of the five classical EEG frequency bands, namely delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Our results showed that the SND group consistently formed a larger number of connections compared to the MCS group in all frequency bands. Additionally, the number of connections in the delta band (0.1-4 Hz) between the left temporal and parieto-occipital areas was significantly different (P < 0.1%) in the two groups. Furthermore, in the beta band (12-18 Hz), the input to the frontal areas from all other cortical areas was also significantly different (P < 0.1%) in the two groups. Finally, classification of the subjects into distinct groups using as features the number of connections within and between regions in all frequency bands resulted in 100% classification accuracy of all subjects. The results of this study suggest that analysis of brain connectivity networks based on GC can be a highly accurate approach for classifying subjects affected by severe traumatic brain injury.},

Clinical classifiers and conventional neuroimaging are limited in TBI detection, outcome prediction, and treatment guidance. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as susceptibility weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging are sensitive to microhemorrhages, white matter injury, and abnormal metabolic activities, respectively, in brain injury. In this article, we reviewed these 3 advanced MRI methods and their applications in TBI and report some new findings from our research. These MRI techniques have already demonstrated their potential to improve TBI detection and outcome prediction. As such, they have demonstrated the capacity of serving as a set of biomarkers to reveal the heterogeneous and complex nature of brain injury in a regional and temporal manner. Further longitudinal studies using advanced MRI in a synergistic approach are expected to provide insight in understanding TBI and imaging implications for treatment.},

abstract = {Partial least squares regression has been an alternative to ordinary least squares for handling multicollinearity in several areas of scientific research since the 1960s. It has recently gained much attention in the analysis of high dimensional genomic data. We show that known asymptotic consistency of the partial least squares estimator for a univariate response does not hold with the very large p and small n paradigm. We derive a similar result for a multivariate response regression with partial least squares. We then propose a sparse partial least squares formulation which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive performance and variable selection by producing sparse linear combinations of the original predictors. We provide an efficient implementation of sparse partial least squares regression and compare it with well-known variable selection and dimension reduction approaches via simulation experiments. We illustrate the practical utility of sparse partial least squares regression in a joint analysis of gene expression and genomewide binding data.},

abstract = {Sex differences in structure and organization of the corpus callosum (CC) have been identified in healthy adults and may be linked to distinct functional lateralization and processing in men and women. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has facilitated noninvasive assessment of CC sex differences in morphology by volumetric imaging and microstructural organization by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Incorporation of recently developed myelin-water fraction (MWF) imaging may improve our understanding of CC sex differences. The aim of the current study was to combine DTI and diffusion tractography with MWF imaging to investigate CC sex differences in 22 healthy adults (11 male, 11 female). We performed MWF imaging using a 5-echo linear combination of spin echo images, and quantified mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) by DTI. Fiber density index (FDi) was quantified using diffusion tractography. The MWF in males was significantly greater than females for the rostral body (p < 0.05) and posterior midbody (p < 0.005); whereas, the splenium MWF in males was significantly less than females (p < 0.05). The DTI analysis revealed significantly increased FA in males compared with females within the genu of the CC (p < 0.05). No significant sex-differences existed for mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity or FDi. Correlations between DTI parameters and MWF were significant but weak. Results of this study demonstrate regionally dependent sex differences in microstructural composition and organization of the CC and the lack of correlation between DTI and MWF suggest both measures provide unique information within the CC.

title = {Automatic anatomical brain MRI segmentation combining label propagation and decision fusion},
abstract = {Regions in three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) brain images can be classified using protocols for manually segmenting and labeling structures. For large cohorts, time and expertise requirements make this approach impractical. To achieve automation, an individual segmentation can be propagated to another individual using an anatomical correspondence estimate relating the atlas image to the target image. The accuracy of the resulting target labeling has been limited but can potentially be improved by combining multiple segmentations using decision fusion. We studied segmentation propagation and decision fusion on 30 normal brain MR images, which had been manually segmented into 67 structures. Correspondence estimates were established by nonrigid registration using free-form deformations. Both direct label propagation and an indirect approach were tested. Individual propagations showed an average similarity index (SI) of 0.754 +/- 0.016 against manual segmentations. Decision fusion using 29 input segmentations increased SI to 0.836 +/- 0.009. For indirect propagation of a single source via 27 intermediate images, SI was 0.779 +/- 0.013. We also studied the effect of the decision fusion procedure using a numerical simulation with synthetic input data. The results helped to formulate a model that predicts the quality improvement of fused brain segmentations based on the number of individual propagated segmentations combined. We demonstrate a practicable procedure that exceeds the accuracy of previous automatic methods and can compete with manual delineations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

title = {Age- and Gender-Related Differences in the Cortical Anatomical Network},
abstract = {Neuroanatomical differences attributable to aging and gender have been well documented, and these differences may be associated with differences in behaviors and cognitive performance. However, little is known about the dynamic organization of anatomical connectivity within the cerebral cortex, which may underlie population differences in brain function. In this study, we investigated age and sex effects on the anatomical connectivity patterns of 95 normal subjects ranging in age from 19 to 85 years. Using the connectivity probability derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography, we characterized the cerebral cortex as a weighted network of connected regions. This approach captures the underlying organization of anatomical connectivity for each subject at a regional level. Advanced graph theoretical analysis revealed that the resulting cortical networks exhibited "small-world" character (i.e., efficient information transfer both at local and global scale). In particular, the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus were consistently observed as centrally connected regions, independent of age and sex. Additional analysis revealed a reduction in overall cortical connectivity with age. There were also changes in the underlying network organization that resulted in decreased local efficiency, and also a shift of regional efficiency from the parietal and occipital to frontal and temporal neocortex in older brains. In addition, women showed greater overall cortical connectivity and the underlying organization of their cortical networks was more efficient, both locally and globally. There were also distributed regional differences in efficiency between sexes. Our results provide new insights into the substrates that underlie behavioral and cognitive differences in aging and sex.},

title = {A Bayesian framework for global tractography},
abstract = {We readdress the diffusion tractography problem in a global and probabilistic manner. Instead of tracking through local orientations, we parameterise the connexions between brain regions at a global level, and then infer on global and local parameters simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. This approach offers a number of important benefits. The global nature of the tractography reduces sensitivity to local noise and modelling errors. By constraining tractography to ensure a connexion is found, and then inferring on the exact location of the connexion, we increase the robustness of connectivity-based parcellations, allowing parcellations of connexions that were previously invisible to tractography. The Bayesian framework allows a direct comparison of the evidence for connecting and non-connecting models, to test whether the connexion is supported by the data. Crucially, by explicit parameterisation of the connexion between brain regions, we infer on a parameter that is shared with models of functional connectivity. This model is a first step toward the joint inference on functional and anatomical connectivity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

title = {Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal},
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.},

title = {Sexual dimorphism in the white matter of rodents},
abstract = {Sexual dimorphism of astrocytes and neurons is well documented in many brain and spinal cord structures. Sexual dimorphism of oligodendrocytes (Olgs) and myelin has received less attention. We recently showed that density of Olgs in corpus callosum, fornix, and spinal cord of wild-type male rodents is more densely packed than in females; myelin proteins and myelin gene expression are likewise greater in males than in female rodents. However, glial cell proliferation and cell death were two times greater in female corpus callosum.Endogenous sex hormones, specifically lack of androgens, produce an Olg female phenotype in castrated male mouse. In vitro studies Using OlgS Culture also showed differences between males and females Olg survival and signaling pathways in response to sexual hormones. Sexual dimorphism of white matter tracts and glia in rodents indicates the necessity for controlling gender in the experimental studies of neurodegenerative disorders. Most importantly, our studies suggest that hormones may contribute to sexual dimorphism observed in certain human diseases including multiple sclerosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
