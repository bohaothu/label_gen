%X This paper examines the application of order-or-processing networks to the
simulation of performance of a complex skill, the copying of high-speed Morse
code.  A sequence of processing stages and memory buffers is described that is
presumed, on the basis of earlier work, to represent the task. Two models of
this sequence, distinguished by their assumptions regarding concurrent
processing of characters, are also presented.  Simulations were run on these
models to find the parameters that yielded the best fit to performance data
from 19 students undergoing the early stages of military Morse code training. 
The implications of the results to an analysis of early performance and the
potential benefits of applying the same technique to data obtained from
students late in training are discussed.

%X This research has developed a theoretically-based cognitive model and design
framework for Integrated Decision Aiding/Training Embedded Systems (IDATES). 
Based on a review of empirical studies of novice-expert differences and of
theoretical and computational models of skill acquisition, we defined a
three-stage cognitive hierarchy model as the basis for our IDATES framework. 
The levels of novice, intermediate, and expert are discrete stages which differ
along two primary dimensions: problem representation and problem-solving
procedure.  Both decision aiding and training must be targeted to the problem
representation and cognitive processes of the user/trainee.  Thus, there must
be three levels of decision aiding targeted to novice, intermediate, and expert
decision makers.  Furthermore, there are two types of training: incremental
training to improve performance within each of the three expertise levels, and
representational training to elicit a jump to the next higher level of problem
representation.  Two implications arise from the IDATES cognitive model. First,
integrated cognitive/behavioral task analyses are able to drive both the
embedded training requirements and the decision aiding requirements, although
the three skill levels must be separately addressed.  Second, a single
integrated architecture can underlie all the decision aiding and embedded
training components of a given IDATES application.

%X Cognitive task analysis and Computer Science have revolutionized training
technology with intelligent tutoring systems (Wenger, 1987).  However, some key
assumptions determine the success of such systems: 1) Student knowledge is
rule-based, so that performance may be evaluated according to the presence or
absence of rules and 2) The computer and the student have access to the same
information about the problem context.  In the instructional task domain we are
addressing -- typeface selection -- neither assumption is appropriate.  Each
selection emerges as an interaction with the parameters and contingencies of
the particular problem (Suchman, 1987).  Furthermore, an important property of
typeface is its evocative or emotional power -- a property that cannot be
represented adequately in a computer.
   Our objective is to develop a satisfactory compromise using computer-aided
instruction, specifically for the domain of typeface selection.  Following
Clancey (1983) and Winograd & Flores (1986), we recognize that some of the
knowledge we seek to train will simply not "be in" the computer. However, it
may be reflected in the design and organization of training exercises, which
set up a sensitivity to the important dimensions of the problem.  We take
advantage of the computer medium to demonstrate typeface and layout
transformations of preprogrammed text examples, as well as text examples
entered on-line by the student.  In addition, a hypertext style menuing system
allows the student to access any part of the system from any point.
   In this paper we provide a description of the system we have built for
training in the domain of typeface selection, and discuss the relevance of this
system for two applications concerns in human factors: 1) The design of
messages for public display and 2) The training of context sensitive skill.

%X When managing complex systems, cognitive demands or problem-solving
situations can appear in different ways.  In some situations, problems surface
gradually while being recognised, identified and treated.  This category of
situations has been labelled as 'going sour' incidents.  Within these
incidents, there are a number of interesting and unique features warranting
special attention.
   The present research project attempts to depict the task demands associated
with going sour incidents.  After initial analysis of complexity and some field
observations, initial hypotheses were generated.  Subsequent field study has
provided support for the hypotheses.
   Major findings on going sour incidents include (1) problem-solving spans a
long period of time and requires synthesis of information over this period; (2)
trouble spots have to be checked repeatedly as the environment is likely to
change over time; (3) interventions are required before obtaining sufficient
number of signs; and (4) multiple hypotheses must be maintained and examined as
the underlying problem changes appearance slowly from one form to another.

%X In recent years, there has been an increase in the number and power of calls
for a systematic development of new principles for the design of training
simulators (e.g. Baudhuin, 1987; Donchin, 1989; Gopher, Weil, Bareket and
Caspi, 1988; Lintern, 1991).  Such principles may replace the long prevailing
physical fidelity approach, which has been enshrined by its compelling appeal
to Folk Psychology (Flexman and Stark, 1987).  The guiding principle of
physical fidelity is that the closer the resemblance between a training
simulator and the real system, the better it is as a training device.  An
alternative approach considered in this panel draws on contemporary concepts
and models in human performance and learning theory.
   Departure from the physical fidelity principle is called upon by the reality
of modern technology as much as it is motivated by enhanced scientific
knowledge and improved methodology.  With the rapid advance of technology, the
constraints and limitations of the physical fidelity approach become clearer
and more prohibitive.  On the one hand, the increased sophistication of
engineering systems, their much enhanced performance envelope and the extreme
operational environments (e.g. air, space, underwater, nuclear), preclude on
the job training.  On the other hand, development of high fidelity simulation
becomes either impossible or a difficult and costly undertaking. Consequently,
the vast majority of existing training simulators represent a compromise.  The
extent of the compromise and its impact on the value of training and transfer
are difficult to assess.
   Modern microprocessor technology and the development of rich, colorful and
challenging computer game environments, provide powerful tools with which the
foundations of a new approach can be studied and tested.  Indeed, this was the
rationale that has guided an international research collaboration directed
towards the development of training strategies embedded in a complex computer
game named Space Fortress (Donchin, Fabiani & Sanders, 1989).
   The three studies reported in the panel, are an outgrowth of this work.  All
three employed a modified version of the Space Fortress game (SF-II) which was
developed at the Human Engineering Laboratory of the Technion - Israel.

%X A study was conducted at the flight school of the Israeli Airforce to test
the transfer of skills from a complex computer game to flight.  The context
relevance of the game to flight was argued on the basis of a skill oriented
task analysis, anchored in contemporary models of the human processing system.
The influence of two embedded training strategies was compared, one focusing on
the specific skills involved in performing the game, the other designed to
improve the general ability of trainees to cope with the high attention load of
the flight task.  Flight scores of two groups of cadets who received 10 hours
of training in the computer game were compared with those of a matched group of
cadets without game experience.  Both game groups performed significantly
better than the no game group in the subsequent test flights.  They also had
higher final percentage of graduation from the flight training program.  The
game has now been incorporated in the regular training program of the airforce.

%X A field study was conducted at the US Army Aviation Center to determine
whether workload-coping and attention-management skills developed through
structured video game experience would generalize to flight training.  Three
groups of 24 trainees were compared (1) One received 10 hours of training on an
IBM-PC version of Space Fortress, replicating an earlier study; (2) The second
played a commercial video game (Apache Strike) for 10 hours which also required
tracking, monitoring, situation assessment, and memory; (3) The third matched
group receive no game training.  Flight school records were monitored during
the next 18 mos to compare performance of the three groups during initial
flight training.  Check ride ratings began to show an advantage for the group
trained with Space Fortress by the Instrument stage of training, as predicted.
Furthermore, attrition rates were lower for this group, replicating the results
of an earlier study conducted by Gopher (1990) in the Israeli Air Force Flight
School.

protocols for training complex skills.  We present evidence that groups of 2, 3
and 4 can learn Space Fortress as well as 1 using 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 the trainer
time and resources respectively.  We also present preliminary empirical steps
towards individualizing training within groups according to individual
differences in selective attention.  We discuss implications for developing
automated instruction that is designed for small groups rather than for
individuals.

search task that required the processing of spatial pattern information
representative of that found with some Command and Control (C{squared})
systems.  A secondary loading task paradigm which required concurrent
performance of an additional spatial pattern search task was employed.  The
results demonstrated superior dual-task performance relative to single-task
baselines on both the primary and secondary tasks when the CM version of the
task was performed.  The results indicate that the development of automatic
processing through training can reduce the workload associated with processing
spatial patterns of the type employed by C{squared} operators.

%X The theoretical and practical importance of search paradigms has been well
established.  This experiment was designed to extend understanding of learning
processes in search tasks.  Subjects trained under memory, visual, or hybrid
memory/visual search conditions and then either transferred to a different
search condition (e.g., train on memory, transfer to visual search) or served
as controls (e.g., train on memory, transfer to memory search).  Asymmetrical
transfer was observed.  These results have implications for current theories of
attention as well as applicability in training situations.

%X The present experiment investigated the effect of varying the degree of task
consistency on the performance and maintenance of skill in a semantic category
visual search task.  It is well established that for a wide variety of tasks,
skill development is a function of the degree of task consistency.  However,
the effect of inconsistency on established skills has not been investigated to
date.  The present experiment included a consistent Training Phase, an Adjusted
Consistency Phase, and a Retraining Phase.  Subjects were trained for 6,000
Consistently Mapped (CM) trials on two different categories.  Subjects then
performed 4,000 trials in which one of the previously trained categories
remained 100% consistent, while the other category became either 100, 67, 50,
or 33% consistent.  Task consistency was then restored and participants
performed another 4,200 CM trials.  The Retraining Phase included a New CM
category.  Results indicated that performance was disrupted by inconsistency,
and that disruption increased as consistency decreased.  Upon the retum of task
consistency, performance improved rapidly, although some performance disruption
was still evident.  The results are discussed in terms of visual search
theories, and for their relation to training design.

%X This experiment examined the effects of three methods of presentation, one
massed and two distributed, on recognition of complex visual stimuli (military
aircraft).  Also examined was whether the effects of these methods differ as a
function of the view at test (same or different from the studied view).  In the
massed presentation, aircraft were exposed once for eight seconds with each
exposure separated by a blank interval of 20 seconds.  In the successive
distributed condition, each target aircraft was presented four times in a row
for two seconds with each exposure separated by blank intervals of five
seconds.  In the random distributed condition, the aircraft were presented for
the same on-off time intervals as the successive distributed condition, but the
sequence of the study list was random.  Results showed that recognition
performance, as assessed by measures of hits, false alarms, and discrimination
accuracy was significantly better when the same view was given at study and at
test versus a different view.  While presentation method did not produce an
effect by itself, it did interact with test view. With a different view at
test, distributed presentation showed a small, but significant, improvement in
recognition performance compared to massed presentation.  These results are
discussed with regard to the high likelihood that most real-word visual stimuli
are seen in a different views at subsequent exposures.  Distributed
presentation may be a useful way to prepare individuals for a different view at
a later time.

%X The Federal Aviation Administration has embarked on a major curriculum
redesign effort to improve the training of en route air traffic controllers. 
Included in this effort was a cognitive task analysis.  One component of the
task analysis was an analysis of operational errors, to obtain insights into
cognitive-perceptual factors contributing to controller decisionmaking error. 
The data suggest that a failure to maintain situation awareness is the primary
cause of controller error.  These results highlight the importance of the
controller task "maintain situation awareness", and are consistent with the
findings of the other analyses.  An approach for training situation awareness
skills is presented in relation to models of expertise developed from other
analyses: an expert mental model of air traffic control, and a task
decomposition listing thirteen primary controller tasks. The findings and
training paradigm have implications for training other complex high-performance
tasks performed in a real-time, multi-tasking environment.

analysis conducted in several phases, spanning several years.  Eight different

%X The purpose of this effort was to model expert pilot performance and
decision making in one-versus-one (1v1) air-to-air combat.  Several
knowledge-elicitation techniques were used to extract air combat expertise from
a former fighter pilot, who served as the subject-matter-expert (SME). 
Unstructured and then structured interviews were used to elicit the goals and
sub-goals of air-to-air combat, plus some of the pilot behaviors necessary to
accomplish the goals.  The SME also flew a number of combat sorties against
another former fighter pilot in the Simulator for Air-to-Air Combat (SAAC) to
demonstrate pilot performance required to accomplish the goals of air combat. 
Based on the SME's verbal protocols, a group of air combat rules were
developed.  A rule-based production system was then designed to incorporate the
resulting knowledge base.  The production system was also designed to be
capable of analyzing an existing data base of air combat engagements.  Expert
system development required additional input from the SME to identify specific
values of flight parameters required by the production system.  Upon completion
and SME verification of the expert model, it will be validated by comparing its
performance to that of our SME in simulated air-to-air combat.  If the model
can successfully describe expert pilot performance, the model will be used to
provide diagnostic performance feedback in conjunction with SAAC training.

%X Experienced subjects participated in four consecutive experiments in which
they performed a simulated low-level flight task.  The study spanned several
months, and various motivational techniques were employed with each experiment.
Since the task involved low-level flight, accurate altitude control was
desirable, and crash rates were of major concern. Based on both verbal and
written subject debriefings, it was concluded that (1) providing lists of top
scores promoted competition and motivated the subjects to improve their
altitude control performance, (2) penalizing scores and negative reinforcement
in the form of posted crash lists were effective in reducing crash rates, and
(3) monetary awards were a minor source of motivation but were not considered a
primary incentive to the subjects.

%X The majority of aviation incidents and accidents are attributable to human
error (Billings & Reynard, 1984).  Most of these human errors involve the
ineffective use of team process factors, which are often referred to as Crew
Resource Management (CRM) skills in the commercial aviation literature
(Helmreich & Foushee, in press).  In addition to these applied concerns, a
revised version of McGrath's (1964) theory of group performance (Foushee &
Helmreich, 1988) suggests that one must analyze the process (i.e., team
process) by which a group's inputs (e.g., personality, attitudes) are
transformed into group outcomes (e.g., task performance, mission safety) in
order to understand how a task-oriented group functions.  Therefore, team
process attracts theoretical as well as practical interest.  The NASA/UT/FAA
Line/LOS Checklist (LLC: Helmreich, Wilhelm, Kello, Taggart, & Butler 1991) is
one measure of team process that has proven useful in assessing CRM skills in
training and in actual line operations.  This paper briefly reviews concepts in
team process and summarizes the LLC research findings pertaining to the use of
CRM skills in commercial aviation.

%X The purpose of this research was to establish the construct validity of a
behaviorally anchored rating scale developed to measure team process behaviors.
This scale contains six skills (i.e. leadership, assertiveness, decision
making/mission analysis, situation awareness, communication,
adaptability/flexibility) that were identified through a prior needs analysis
with training specialists and subject matter experts.  Student and instructor
pilots (104 individuals, 51 teams) participated in two team tasks (simulated
aviation tasks) which were designed to elicit the team process behaviors
identified for the rating scale, and were rated on their behaviors.  A
multitrait-multimethod analysis on the resulting ratings (Campbell and Fiske,
1959) was conducted.  Evidence of convergent and discriminant validity as well
as some method bias were found when the method investigated was team task. 
Implications for the use of the team process scale in training are discussed.

%X The evaluation of team training within the Navy often relies on instructor
assessments of human performance.  Often, assessments are subjectively derived
and may, therefore, contain biases. Consequently, a method for objectively
measuring Navy team performance was developed in an attempt to supplement
commonly found subjective assessments.  The technique is based upon collecting
observable indicators of effective and ineffective behaviors across several
critical functions of the anti-air warfare (AAW) team.  The effective and
ineffective indicators are mathematically combined to form a performance index
ranging from 0.00 (low) to 1.00 (high) to reflect the team's overall
performance level.  The AAW Team Performance Index (ATPI) provides a
systematic, consistent, and objective measurement approach linked to specific
exercise events. The development and use of the ATPI are described.

%X A fundamental purpose of a display format is to allow the human operator to
construct and maintain an accurate representation of reality.  In order for
display designers to know how to portray spatial information, one must
understand how humans represent and use spatial relationships.  The purpose of
this study was to determine the effective use of four different types of
spatial display formats in the performance of a spatial discrimination task. 
Forty subjects initially viewed a display portraying simulated radar returns
representing the relative position of two other aircraft (in formation), and
then chose which of two spatial alternatives portrayed the true spatial
relationship viewed previously.  Results showed that subjects' ability to
discriminate between the spatial alternatives was adversely affected by the
type of display format used, and the degree of distortion of the true spatial
relationships.  The results are interpreted in terms of the resolution of one's
mental representation of spatial relationships.

%X Air Force pilots and control subjects were tested on a visual "mental
rotation" task.  Nine of the 16 pilots, as well as all of the 16 control
subjects, required more time to rotate greater angular distances.  The
performance of the other 7 pilots was unique: their response time did not
increase with greater angular rotations.  The results suggest that visual
mental rotation can be accomplished by at least two different processes.  One
process involves incremental object rotations in a multi-step mapping -- like
an actual physical rotation of an object -- going through intermediate stages.
This process requires more time to rotate greater angular distances.  The other
process involves direct translation in a single-step mapping.  In this process,
the starting position transforms into the final position in one mapping without
any intermediate steps, and thus does not require more time to rotate greater
angular rotation.  The lack of intermediate stages, which may allow small
perturbations in location to be corrected, affects the accuracy of this
process; this is particularly apparent when more complex stimuli are rotated. 
The pilots who did not show incremental rotation effects had different and
distinct error patterns, their errors increased when rotating the more complex
stimuli.

%X The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there is a relationship
between the development of a perceptual skill and the visual field of
presentation for verbal and spatial stimuli.  Subjects performed an extended
practice Sternberg task in which targets were presented in either the left
visual field (LVP) or right visual field (RVF).  Both verbal (letters) and
spatial (3x3 grid patterns) stimuli were used.  The results indicated that
visual field was not a significant factor for simple verbal stimuli.  However,
there was an initial LVF, or right hemisphere (RH), advantage for spatial
stimuli that switched to a RVF, or left hemisphere (LH), advantage after a
skill develops.  These data support an analytic role for the LH, which may be
the focus for feature detection expertise.  Another finding was that individual
differences in cerebral dominance may influence the development of perceptual
skill.  Together these data shed light on possible biological constraints of
human information processing models.

%X An experiment was conducted in a fixed-base driving simulator which
manipulated the time-to-arrival (T{sub:a}) of an oncoming vehicle, the viewing
distance to that vehicle and the type of oncoming vehicle to determine the
perceptual basis for a left-turn decision.  Forty-eight participants were
randomly assigned to a group where either a motorcycle, a compact car, a
full-size car, or delivery truck represented the oncoming vehicle.  There were
an equal number of participants of each gender in the four groups.  As T{sub:a}
was increased, underestimation of vehicle arrival time also increased. 
Significant main effects were found for T{sub:a}, gender of participants,
vehicle type, and viewing distance, and for interactions for gender x T{sub:a}
and gender x vehicle type.  Males and females differed in their accuracy of
judgments for vehicle types, where males were more accurate in estimating the
arrival of delivery vans and motorcycles than their female peers.  The pattern
of results for the size of the approach vehicle were consistent with a
margin-of-safety explanation which argues that driver underestimation of the
arrival times of larger vehicles generally allows larger margins-of-safety than
for smaller vehicles.  The importance of these findings for the development of
advanced in-vehicle collision avoidance and warning systems is briefly
considered.

%X RAPCOM (rapid communication) displays involve temporal presentation of
information in the same spatial location and have been suggested to have useful
potential for human-computer interactions involving high information transfer
rates (cf., Matin and Boff, 1988).  An experiment was conducted to evaluate the
relative effectiveness of various spatial and temporal display formats for
presenting information pertaining to the likelihood of aircraft stall using the
simulated dynamics of a light aircraft. Specific spatial and temporal
characteristics of the display formats were based on the proximity
compatibility principle (PCP) which attempts to integrate findings regarding
the benefits and limitations of displaying multiple sources of information in
similar or "proximal" ways (Wickens and Andre, 1990; Carswell and Wickens,
1990).
   The effectiveness of these display formats were compared for judgments which
required the integration of three display parameters (airspeed, bank, and flap
angle) to determine stall probability with those requiring focused attention
necessitating the recall of the specific value of one of the parameters.  For
the complex monitoring task used in this experiment, temporal display formats
were generally associated with the most accurate performance.  Furthermore, the
overall pattern of results was not consistent with design guidelines suggested
by the PCP, and suggest difficulties when attempting to define "proximity" in
terms of physical metrics based on spatial or temporal parameters.

%X Information formatting in terms of optimal spatial and temporal parameters
has become an important issue with the advent of computer automated displays. 
One temporal format involving sequential presentation of information, termed
RAPCOM (for rapid communication; cf., Matin and Boff, 1988), has the potential
to increase performance in situations involving high information transfer
rates.  The present study investigated the relative contributions of two
spatial parameters comparing RAPCOM with more conventional spatial formats
involving simultaneous presentation of information.  The parameters of
character size and spatial separation were examined because they are important
determinants of display legibility and visual search, respectively. 
Performance was assessed in terms of speed and accuracy for a task that
required observers to recall integers presented in either an analog or digital
format.
   The findings showed that accuracy performance decreased as the information
became spatially separated.  Specifically, RAPCOM formats produced the best
performance and the large spatial separation the worst performance.  A
different pattern of results was obtained for character size, depending on
whether the display indicators were analog or digital.  For analog dials,
character size had no systematic effect on performance. However, for digital
dials, character size produced an interaction in that the fastest and most
accurate performance of all conditions was associated with the spatial format
consisting of large characters and small spatial separation. In other words,
under conditions associated with high legibility and relatively low visual
search, more traditional spatial formats exceeded performance levels associated
with the RAPCOM format.  These findings are relevant for designers when trying
to evaluate the relative merits inherent in spatial versus temporal display
formats.

%X Recent work in graphical perception has attempted to identify the mental
operations used by an observer when extracting information from a graphical
display (e.g., Hollands and Spence, in press; Simkin and Hastie, 1987).  The
current research varied the alignment, scaling, and size of proportions shown
in pie charts and divided bar graphs.  Subjects were required to discriminate
between two proportions (i.e., which proportion is larger?), each shown
relative to its own whole.  Response times and errors were measured.  Results
from Experiment 1 show that for both pies and divided bars, the time penalty
for discriminating unaligned proportions was dependent on the size difference
between the two proportions, with a greater penalty with a smaller percent
difference.  Results from Experiment 2 show that different scaling slowed
subjects considerably, especially when the size difference was small, and
especially with divided bars.  The results are interpreted in terms of
hypothesized alignment, scaling, and discrimination operations.  The practical
implications for graphical design are also discussed.

%X The secondary task technique was used to test two alternative explanations
of dual task decrement: outcome conflict and resource allocation.  Subjects
time-shared a continuous tracking task and a discrete Sternberg memory task. 
The memory probes were presented under three temporal predictability
conditions.  Dual task performance decrements in both the tracking and memory
tasks suggested that the two tasks competed for some common resources,
processes, or mechanisms.  Although performance decrements were consistent with
both the outcome conflict and resource allocation explanations, the two
explanations propose different mechanisms by which the primary task could be
protected from interference from the concurrent secondary task.  The primary
task performance could be protected by resource allocation or by strategic
sequencing of the processing of the two tasks in order to avoid outcome
conflict.  In addition to examining the global trial means, moment-by-moment
tracking error time-locked to the memory probe was also analyzed.  There was
little indication that the primary task was protected by resequencing of the
processing of the two tasks.  This together with the suggestion that
predictable memory probes led to better protected primary task performance than
less predictable memory probes lend support for the resource explanation.

%X The purpose of the present study was to examine the utility of the resource
notion, which is the basis for the secondary task technique of workload
assessment.  The unbiased optimum-maximum method proposed by Navon (1984) was
used to manipulate task priority without conveying to the subjects that
time-shared performance must tradeoff.  Three task pairs that fell on a
continuum of degree of shared resources were tested.  The data showed that
performance tradeoff is not an experimental artifact.  Moreover, the data
suggested that increased degree of shared resources led to increased resource
allocation optimality and decreased time-sharing efficiency, as predicted by
multiple resource theories.  The present data suggests that resource theories
are useful in explaining dual task performance, and that the secondary task can
be a useful workload assessment tool.

%X The present study evaluated dual-task performance as a function of the
vertical separation between a tracking task and a discrete-response task, to
provide data relevant to the positioning of aircraft head-up display (HUD)
information.  The data were consistent with Sanders' (1970) research on visual
scanning where a nonlinear decrease in performance as a function of the
horizontal separation between two displays was observed.  Performance is
equivalent across a range of visual angles from superimposition to 6.4{deg}
vertical separation between displays.  The cost to performance is increased for
moderate vertical separations (9.6{deg} to 22.5{deg}) where visual scanning is
required.  At larger separations, the performance cost increases linearly with
visual angle, where head movements may begin to supplement eye movements in
order to access information.  The function which describes the cost of vertical
separation was observed to be larger at both small and moderate visual angles
when the information in the two displays required integration.  The data
suggest that nonconformal HUD information may be placed a few degrees down from
a superimposed position without a significant performance loss.

%X Fifteen male volunteers participated in a dual-task study in which the
central processing load of visual memory and tracking tasks and the physical
load of the tracking task were orthogonally manipulated to produce varying
levels of task difficulty.  Multiple modes of assessment were used to measure
mental workload (MWL) across difficulty levels, including: performance,
subjective, cardiovascular, and metabolic.  To our knowledge, this study is the
first to demonstrate metabolic change with manipulations of cognitive task
difficulty; others have found only baseline-to-task changes.  The relation of
the metabolic demands of the task to central processing resource utilization
provided support for a structural energetic model of attention that may help to
explain measure dissociations.  The results of the present study indicated that
heart period was only sensitive to central manipulations of task difficulty
that affected energetic resources.  Performance and subjective MWL were
sensitive to all cognitive components of the tasks.  We suggest that
cardiovascular measures will associate with other measures only when the
manipulations of task difficulty require energetic adjustment, and would expect
these measures to dissociate when energetic adjustment is not required.

%X The purpose of this symposium is to provide a forum for technical exchanges
between vision researchers and those interested in visual target acquisition. 
The symposium will also introduce those in the audience who are not specialists
in these areas to important concepts from modern vision research, and provide
an introduction to models of visual target acquisition.  These topics play an
important role in many applications in which human factors specialists are
called upon to provide inputs (e.g., computer graphics, image quality, aviation
displays, camouflage).  However, information on these topics is not readily
available.  Few reports on visual target acquisition modeling have been
published in the open literature, and the topic is not covered in most human
factors texts.  Basic vision research and linear-systems models are available
in the open literature, but this material requires considerable background
before it can be used effectively.  This, in fact, is probably the major reason
why there has been little communication between the applied community and
vision researchers to date.  This symposium will help to remedy this problem,
and encourage the transfer of knowledge from those involved in basic research
to those concerned mainly with applications.

%X Two traditions of vision modeling have coexisted for many years with little
or no transfer of information between them.  Those interested in models of
visual target acquisition for real-world scenarios have developed engineering
models, which are essentially empirical summaries of visual performance data. 
On the other hand, basic researchers in visual psychophysics and
neurophysiology have developed quantitative models of pattern perception.  The
basic research models have increased in generality and scope to the point that
they are potentially powerful tools for addressing certain real-world needs
that have recently come to the fore.  The needs include quantitative,
theory-based methods for evaluating target signatures, effects of background
clutter, and observer false alarm rates.  This paper reviews the shortcomings
of existing target acquisition models, and reports work in progress to develop
an improved model of target acquisition that incorporates a model of pattern
perception from basic vision research.

%X The relationship of human target acquisition times and detection
probabilities to electronically measured visual clutter was investigated.
Ninety computer-generated scenes simulating infrared imagery and containing
different levels of clutter and zero, one, two, or three targets were produced.
Targets were embedded in these scenes counterbalancing for range and position.
Global and local clutter were measured using both statistical variance and
probability of edge metrics. Thirty-three aviators, tankers, and infantry
soldiers were shown still-video images of the 90 scenes and were instructed to
search for targets. Analyses indicate differences between the aviators and
tankers in search times and types of errors.  Results of multiple regression
analyses of global clutter, local clutter, range, target dimension, target
complexity, number of targets, and experience on search times are given and
discussed in terms search strategies.

%X A model consisting of multiple tuned and oriented spatial filters followed
by non-linear transducer functions is described.  The model was originally
derived to account for human perception of contrast while viewing isolated
stimuli.  The model can also account for human estimates for the image
sharpness of spatially filtered real world scenes.  The model has several
shortcomings uncovered by recent experimental results involving suppression of
the apparent contrast of a foveally presented grating patch by a peripheral
grating.

%X Visual target acquisition (TA) often involves detecting targets against
natural backgrounds that have complex luminance distributions. The purpose of
this study was to evaluate a simple technique that controls target contrast in
the presence of varying backgrounds.  Target contrast was measured by the root
mean square (rms) method and was controlled by adjusting only the target
luminance, leaving the background unchanged.  The technique was tested in a TA
paradigm in which observers searched for an aircraft that was embedded in 1) a
uniform background, 2) a natural terrain background, or 3) a moving natural
terrain background.  Four target contrast levels were tested. The results
showed that TA time varied with background and target contrast.  Significant
differences in TA time were observed among the different backgrounds for
targets of the same physical contrast, especially at low contrast levels. 
Although contrast had a systematic effect on TA performance, factors other than
contrast influenced TA performance.  It was concluded that background structure
increased TA time by camouflaging targets and by introducing distractors to the
task. Such an approach could be used to model TA performance under conditions
where target and background complexity are an inherent feature of the TA task.

%X Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used to conduct a variety of
reconnaissance missions with human operators interpreting the transmitted
imagery at ground stations.  Current UAV data link designs require limited
capacity which will result in a cost to the operator.  Two common techniques to
reduce video data rates exist, data compression and simple data reduction such
as lowering of frame rate and resolution.  The objective of this research was
to determine the degree to which data volume can be reduced in terms of frame
rate, spatial and grey-scale resolution, while retaining sufficient information
to support human performance.  Two studies were conducted to examine the
influence of frame rate, resolution, and compression trade-offs.  Experiment I
utilized real mission imagery to assess operator performance in target
detection, recognition, and designation.  Experiment II used a simulation with
dynamically manipulated UAV parameters to assess the influence of frame rate
and resolution on target designation and tracking.  Results indicate that frame
rate has a greater influence than resolution on human performance in all four
tasks.  Overall, operators can perform tasks at rates reduced to 4 frames per
second.  Half resolution over the total display does not adversely affect
performance except in recognition tasks. When resolution is calculated as a
function of dynamically-controlled UAV parameters, 8 TV lines across the target
appears to result in the best performance; however, these data are not as
consistent as those in Experiment I.

%X Many experimental and real-world viewing situations provide a context in
which the target stimulus is displayed against a background set at a different
but determinate distance.  Conversely, other situations occur where the
background distance is indeterminate, i.e., a textureless background.  There
has been evidence accumulating over the past two decades to suggest that the
assumption of accurate visual accommodation will not be sustained under all
these circumstances.  Although earlier assumptions held that the centrally
located stimulus would determine the level of accommodation, this experiment
tests that assumption by varying the cues to background distance
(well-textured, lighted, distant background and the same background
unilluminated) and the distance to the target stimulus.  Two groups of six
participants observed targets (2 deg.) at six distances (0.9, 1.8, 3.7, 7.3,
14.6 and 29.3 m) and their visual accommodation was measured with a laser
optometer.  Results indicated that the group viewing the visible distant
background evidenced a more distant accommodative response with the typical lag
of accommodation.  These results indicate that conditions of accommodation in
the natural environment may have a profound effect on accommodative accuracy. 
In turn, this inaccuracy has been shown by others to correlate with
inaccuracies in the perception of size and distance.  Inaccurate accommodation
has been found to delay target detection appreciably as well.  Ameliorative
approaches are discussed.

%X The present study evaluated a new aircraft attitude display concept.  The
new symbology format, or Theta display, was developed by integrating the
features of the conventional attitude/direction indicator (ADI) and head-up
attitude reference display (HUD) into a single format.  Number of trials to
reach a specific performance criterion and tracking performance were collected
as dependent variables on an attitude maintenance task.  The results show that
performance and training time were better with both the Theta display and the
ADI than with the HUD.  The findings support the hypothesis that an attitude
display formed of the integration of ADI and HUD symbology will demonstrate a
performance benefit over a pure HUD format.

%X The objectives of this experiment were to determine whether coding missed
approach instructions in text or icons would result in more efficient
information transfer, and if the information transfer efficiency for either
coding technique was dependent upon the level of information content.  Twelve
pilots currently licensed for instrument (IFR) flight participated as subjects.
Text instructions were either taken directly or developed from instructions
found on National Ocean Service (NOS) instrument approach procedure charts.
These instructions possessed one of three levels of information content: low,
medium, and high.  Across the range of information content levels, iconic
missed approach instructions were comprehended more quickly and as accurately
as instructions coded in text of the font style and size used by NOS. 
Regardless of coding technique, report accuracy was significantly worse for
instructions with a high information content level.  Pilots indicated that in
single pilot IFR conditions, they would rather have the iconic than the text
version of the missed approach instructions.

display information format included a digital format, an analogue format, and a
combined (digital and analogue) format.  Predictions for the appropriate level
of display information format for the fault mangement tasks were based on the
multiple information format concept.  In general, the results obtained in this

concept.

data were collected for each format on four tasks typically performed in a
shipboard Combat Information Center (CIC).  The three presentation formats were
character readout (CRO), text-only, and text-graphics.  Results showed the
text-only and text-graphics formats produced faster, more accurate performance
than the CRO on count and compare tasks; however, no reliable performance
differences were found between presentation formats for identify and criterion
tasks.  Predictions concerning an advantage for the text-graphics format over
the text-only format on certain types of tasks were not supported by the study
findings.  The practical applications and design implications of these findings
are discussed.

%X Interest in the study of attention control under dichoptic conditions is
instigated by the contemporary development of night-vision systems based on
single-eye helmet-mounted displays.  Two experiments were conducted to
investigate the concurrent performance of a tracking task and letter
classification under dichoptic display conditions.  Subjects were required to
fly a simulated helicopter path while classifying letter pairs presented
intermittently.  Experimental instructions in Experiment A specifically
emphasized a two-dimensional interpretation of the visual field.  Under these
instructions, the presentation of a common visual axis to the two eyes provided
by the flight-tunnel did not aid subjects, and their performance deteriorated
in dichoptic conditions.  In Experiment B, the instructions to subjects were
changed to advocate a three-dimensional interpretation of the display.  Under
these instructions, dichoptic performance-levels were substantially improved
when the tunnel was present.  These results imply that the presence of a common
visual axis is not automatically beneficial.  In order to improve performance,
attention should be intentionally directed to utilize information supporting a
three-dimensional frame of mind.  These findings have important implications
for understanding the dynamics of performance with single-eye helmet-mounted
displays, and the training of pilots in their use.

this study was to determine whether decreases in ambient illumination level
would facilitate calibration and increase the probability of use by subjects. 
Monocular versus binocular calibration was also studied to determine whether
the occlusion of one eye would cause the pupil of the other to dilate,
therefore allowing the use of a higher level of illumination during
calibration.  Twenty subjects (10 monocular and 10 binocular) were tested at
four ambient illumination levels (10, 50, 100, and 210 lux) in both ascending
and descending orders of presentation.  Analyses of frequency and pupil
diameter data revealed a statistically significant increase in calibration at
lower levels of illumination. An increased frequency of calibration for
monocular (versus binocular) viewing conditions was also found.

Findings revealed significant differences between handheld and fixed

resting point accommodation were not apparent.  The resting posture of
accommodation and seated posture are discussed as potential contributors to
determination of viewing distance preferences.

%X Forty subjects responded to a set of 64 different combinations of linear
displays and rotary controls presented by photographic slides.  The subject's
task was to rotate a control to increase the numerical value on the display. 
It was expected that response time for an arrangement having a strong
stereotype would be faster than one with a weaker stereotype.  Data showed
there a strong relationship between these two measures of compatibility for
horizontal displays with controls either on the top or bottom of the display;
there was no significant relationship for any of the vertical layouts. 
Comparing horizontal and vertical displays, the average response times were
1.25 and 1.55 seconds and average stereotype strengths were .86 and .73,
respectively.  Thus on both criteria, horizontal displays were superior to
vertical displays. Response time was found to be dependent on the magnitude of
the component principle making the greatest contribution to the strength of the
overall stereotype.  In the case of horizontal displays this was the
clockwise-to-right principle; for vertical displays it was Warrick's principle
or, if this was not applicable, the scale-side principle.

%X Three variables were manipulated in an attempt to determine the conditions
of optimal performance using object-like displays. Uniquely color coding the
vertices of the object did not appear to cause a significant change in separate
or integral task accuracy. The introduction of a display based on the Gestalt
law of closure in which the middle third of each side of the object was removed
improved separate task accuracy relative to the object display. Separate task
accuracy for the closure display was not as good as the bar display. 
Integration task accuracy was not harmed by this manipulation.  The validity of
the emergent feature for information integration was manipulated.  Lower levels
of validity reduce integration task accuracy for all displays equally.  Thus,
if information integration is the operator's primary task, display designers
should consider using the closure display in place of the object display.  The
usefulness of both object and closure displays may be limited since the
emergent feature may be less than 100% valid for the information integration
task in many real world situations.  This is due to constraints in the geometry
of object displays.

%X A study was performed to test the hypothesis that color coding can be used
to enhance the speed and accuracy of performance on a focused attention task
when object displays are employed.  Subjects performed both a focused attention
and an integration task while viewing a rectangle display that represented the
readings of four system parameters.  The object displays were presented to
subjects in one of four color coding conditions: (1) monochrome; (2) parameter
type; (3) parameter state; or (4) system state.  Study results indicated that
the system state color code significantly reduced integration task response
time without degrading integration task accuracy.  For the focused attention
task, there was no significant difference between monochrome and the remaining
color code conditions for either response time or accuracy.

%X Thirty adult subjects studied each of eighteen single-function line graphs
for self-determined periods.  The structural complexity of the stimulus graphs
was varied in three ways: through addition of data points, reversal of trends,
and elimination of symmetry.  Subjects provided written interpretations
immediately following examination of each graph.  Indirect indices of
comprehensibility (i.e., increased graph study times and increased content in
the written interpretations) suggested that trend reversals were the primary
determinant of complexity.  While the number of data points and the presence or
absence of symmetry were not associated with longer study times or greater
overall content production, varying these structural features did lead to
strategic shifts in the interpretive emphasis on global versus local features
of the graphically-displayed data.  Specifically, the presence of symmetry or
the addition of data points led to increases in global content and decreases in
local content.  Lastly, cognitive style of subjects was systematically related
to graphical interpretation.  Impulsive subjects were less likely than
reflective subjects to interpret local features of the graph, and were also
less sensitive to variation in structural characteristics.

%X This study sought to: (1) analytically separate the components of a
graphical display which contributed to performance on integrated and separable
tasks; and (2) determine the effect of the number of dimensions of information
which had to be integrated.  To that end, the study employed a 7 X 3 mixed
design with seven displays manipulated between-subjects and the number of
information dimensions (three, six, and nine) manipulated within-subjects.  The
seven displays examined included two bar graphs (non-object and object
formats), two midline displays (non-object and object formats), a direct
graphical display, and two numerical displays (numerical separable and
numerical integrative).  Based upon propositions generated from emergent
feature theory, the ability to integrate information in these displays should
be a function of the faithfulness, saliency, and directness of mapping the
decision statistic onto the display.  Results indicated that the displays which
directly represented the integrated decision, the numerical integrative and the
direct graphical displays, resulted in the best performance.  Intermediate
performance was obtained on those displays (i.e. the object bar graph, the
non-object midline, and the object midline) which incorporated faithfulness,
saliency, or both, respectively.  The worst performance on the integrated task
was exhibited for those displays (i.e. the numerical separable and the
non-object bar) which did not represent directness, faithfulness, or saliency.
For both the integrated and separable tasks, accuracy increased as the number
of information dimensions increased.  The unexpected direction of this effect
was attributed to subjects' investing more resources in performing the task at
the six or nine cue levels due to the perceived increase in difficulty of the
task.

%X The present study was designed to examine the role of boredom, perceived
mental workload, and perceived control in vigilance. Subjective estimates of
boredom and mental workload were measured before and after a 40 minute vigil
during which movements of a computer mouse were monitored.  In addition,
subjects were administered Rotter's (1966) locus of control inventory. 
Subjects who made progressively more movements over time reported the highest
levels of boredom and workload. In addition, the subjects with the highest
performance levels were the most cautious in their responding, had an internal
locus of control, and tended to experience less frustration.  Significant,
positive correlations were also observed between the boredom and workload
scores suggesting that boredom may be an important contributor to mental
workload in sustained attention.

%X This study examined the effects of exposure to intermittent jet aircraft
noise played through stereophonic speakers (70dBA or 95dBA maximum intensity)
on performance efficiency and perceived workload in a 40-min visual vigilance
task. The noise featured a Doppler-like quality in which planes seemed to
approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right.  Performance in
noise, measured in terms of perceptual sensitivity (d'), was significantly
poorer than in a quiet condition.  Moreover, in comparison to subjects
performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from
knowledge of results (KR) regarding performance efficiency.  In addition to its
negative effects upon signal detectability, noise significantly elevated
perceived workload, as indexed by the NASA-TLX.  This effect was robust; it was
not mitigated by KR, even though KR served generally to reduce the overall
level of perceived workload in the study.  The consistency of the effects of
noise in regard to both performance efficiency and perceived workload
challenges a recent conclusion offered by Koelega and Brinkman (1986) that
lawful relations are not observable in studies of the effects of noise on
vigilant behavior.

%X Two studies examined the effects of automation reliability and task
complexity on the monitoring of automation failures during performance of a
flight-simulation task.  In the first study, 24 students performed tracking and
resource management tasks while an automation routine monitored for system
malfunctions over four 30-minute sessions.  Detection of automation failures
was significantly higher for variable reliability automation (mean = 81.6%)
than for constant reliability automation (mean = 32.7%), indicating that
constant-reliability automation induced complacency in monitoring.  The effect
of automation reliability was eliminated when 16 more subjects were required to
complete the monitoring task only.  Neither group of subjects exhibited a
vigilance decrement.  In the second study monitoring performance and vigilance
decrement were examined for a situation in which only one automation failure
occurred during a session.  36 students were randomly assigned to one of three
task groups: simple (visual discrimination task), single-complex (monitoring
only) or multi-complex (tracking, resource management, and monitoring).  In
both the simple and the multi-complex tasks, more subjects detected the
automation failure in the first ten minutes of a session than in the last ten
minutes of a session (67%-17% and 75%-42% respectively).  Subjects in the
single-complex condition detected the automation failure equally well in both
time periods (92%-83%).  The results point to two areas of potential costs in
the automation of a task: (1) constant patterns of automation reliability can
lead to inefficiency in monitoring automation failures, and (2) infrequent
automation failures in multi-task conditions can lead to a vigilance decrement.
While these costs should not prohibit the implementation of automation, they
should be considered in the design of any automated system.

%X Although the amount of clinical data available through critical care
monitoring systems has steadily increased, little integration of that data
occurs.  Consequently, higher order relationships cannot be obtained directly.
An ecological psychology approach to display design that attempts to reduce the
cognitive load for the clinician by directly displaying the functional
relationships between parameters is compared with a traditional approach in a
monitoring and control task.  Analysis of performance by Critical and
Non-Critical Care Nurses and Novices suggests that the integrated display
facilitates performance for all groups.
