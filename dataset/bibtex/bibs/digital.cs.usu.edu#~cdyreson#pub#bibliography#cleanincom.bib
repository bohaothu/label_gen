abstract=	"We represent a set of possible worlds using an
incomplete information database. The representation techniques that we
study form a hierarchy, which generalizes relations of constants. This
hierarchy ranges from the very simple Codd-table, (i.e., a relation of
constants and distinct variables called nulls, which stand for values
present but unknown), to much more complex mechanisms involving views
on conditioned-tables, (i.e., queries on Codd-tables together with
conditions.) The views we consider are the queries that have
polynomial data-complexity on complete information databases. Our
conditions are conjunctions of equalities and inequalities. (1) We
provide matching upper and lower bounds on the data-complexity of
testing containment, membership, and uniqueness for sets of possible
worlds and we fully classify these problems with respect to our
representation hierarchy. The most surprising result in this
classification is that: it is complete in $\{Pi_2}^{p}$, whether a set
of possible worlds represented by a Codd-table with one conjunction of
inequalities. (2) We investigate the data-complexity of querying
incomplete information databases. We examine both asking for certain
facts and for possible facts. Our approach is algebraic but our bounds
also apply to logical databases. We show that asking for a certain
fact is coNP-complete, even for a fixed first order query on a
Codd-table. We thus strengthen a lower bound of [16], who showed that
this holds for a Codd-table with a conjunction of inequalities. For
each fixed positive existential query we present a polynomial
algorithm solving the bounded possible fact problem of this query on
conditioned-tables. We show that our approach is, in a sense, the best
possible, by deriving two NP-completeness lower bounds for the bounded
possible fact problem: when the fixed query contains either negation
or recursion." ,

abstract=	"Knowledge mining is the process of discovering new
knowledge that is hitherto unknown. Users with a lack of knowledge of
database schemas engage in the process of knowledge mining by posing
imprecise queries. An approach to knowledge mining by imprecise
querying is presented that utilizes conceptual clustering techniques.
In contrast to numeric or fuzzy set approaches which ultimately rely
on some distance metric and threshold to processing such queries,
conceptual clustering retrieves instances which are structurally,
semantically, and pragmatically similar to the query even though they
may not match the requirements exactly. The query processor has both a
deductive and inductive component. The deductive component finds
precise matches in the traditional sense, and the inductive component
identifies ways in which imprecise matches may be considered similar.
Ranking on similarity is done using the database taxonomy, by which
similar instances become members of the same class. Relative
similarity is determined by depth in the taxonomy. The conceptual
clustering algorithm, its use in query processing and an example are
presented." ,

abstract=	" This paper presents different approaches which
enable a data base management system to obtain a plausible fuzzy
estimate for an attribute value of an item for which the information
is not explicity stored in the data base. This can be made either by a
kind of analogical reasoning from information about particular items
or by means of expert rules which specify the (fuzzy) sets of possible
values of the attribute under consideration, for various classes of
items. Another kind of expert rules enables the system to computer an
estimate from the attribute value of another item provided that, in
other respects, this latter item sufficiently resembles the item, the
value of which we are interested in; then these expert rules are used
either for controlling the analogical reasoning process or for
enlarging the scope of application of the first kind of expert rules.
The different approaches are discussed in the framework of possibility
theory. " ,

mean that an attribute is applicable but its value at present is
unknown and also that an attribute is applicable but its value is
arbitrary. We adopt the view that tuples denote statements of
predicate logic about database relations. Then, a null value of the
first kind, respectively second kind,, corresponds to an existentially
quantified variable, respectively universally quantified variable. For
instance if $r$ is a database relation without null values and $X$ is
a range declaration for $r$ then the tuple
$(a,\forall,b,\exists)\ismember R$ is intended to mean ``there exists
an $x\ismember X$ such that for all $y\ismember X: (a,y,b,x)\ismember
r$''. We extend basic operations of the well-known relational algebra
to relations with null values. Using formal notions of correctness and
completeness (adapted from predicate logic) we show that our
extensions are meaningful and natural. Furthermore we reexamine the
generalized join within our framework. Finally we investigate the
algebraic structure of the class of relations with null values under a
partial ordering which can be interpreted as a kind of logical
implication." ,

redundancy, associated with our notion of representation, are
investigated. Extensions of the relational algebra to relations with
maybe-tuples and null values are proposed. Our extensions are
essentially Codd's, with some modifications. It is proved that these
extensions have natural properties which are formally stated as being
adequate and restricted. By the treatment of difference and division,
our formal framework can be used even for operations that require
``negative information.'' Finally, extensions of update operations are
discussed." ,

besides the two extreme cases in which we know either everything or
nothing about a value, there is also the general case in which we have
partial information on a value-more precisely, in which we know that
the value is an element of some set. Vassiliou also treats another
null value, meaning ``attribute not applicable'' or ``inconsistent''.
Both approaches are seen too impractical due to the high computational
complexity of the query evaluation algorithms. Codd's proposal can be
implemented within the framework of a common relational database

of nonmonotonic reasoning for Artificial Intelligence. After
presenting some simple forms of nonmonotonicity as they arise in
various well-known AI systems we present in Section 2 some of the most
important existing nonmonotonic logics: McCarthy's circumscription,
Moore's autoepistemic logic, and Reiter's default logic. Section 3
examines an approach in which default reasoning is reduced to
reasoning in the presence of inconsistent information. The approach is
based on the notion of preferred maximal consistent subsets. It is
shown that these preferred subsets can be defined in such a way that
it is possibly (sic) to represent priorities between defaults
adequately. Section 4 briefly discusses the problem of implementing
nonmonotonic systems." ,

effective use of knowledge-based systems in a wide variety of domains.
Design is typical of these domains in that the implementation of a
design in an artifact, the future environment for the artifact, and
the component characteristics of the artifact are all uncertain.
Existing probabilistic schemes to address the inherent uncertainty in
areas like design assume precise knowledge of the probabilities of
relevant events. This paper defines a probabilistic method for
uncertainty management with imprecise inputs. The approach combines
Bayesian inference networks and information theoretic inference
procedures. The resulting scheme manages both imprecision and
uncertainty in the problem domain. An application of the approach to
material design is described." ,

representing information that is inherently imprecise or is the
aggregation of the subjective opinions of a number of individuals.
Measuring the degree of precision or lack thereof is important for two
reasons. First, if the measures themselves achieve extrema when
conditions match what is intuitively recognized as maximum and minimum
fuzziness, then confidence in the medium to faithfully represent the
intervening range of precision is increased. Second, querying fuzzy
information may result in ambiguous replies and measures of
preciseness may fathom how well the query discriminated among the
possible replies. Entropy measures based on the fuzzy and
probabilistic attributes of databases are devloped as applied to the
two ends mentioned above." ,

This theory is one component of an integrated approach to
data-modelling that accommodates both probabilistic and relational
data. In fact, many of the results presented here were developed in
the context of a framework for structural modelling of systems. Much
that is fundamental to relational database theory was also developed
in this context, and previous to the introduction by Codd of the
relational model of data. Probabilistic databases can store types of
information that cannot be represented using the relational model.
Probabilistic databases may also be viewed as generalizations of
relational databases; any relational database can be represented
without loss of information by a probabilistic database. A number of
relational database concepts are shown to have probabilistic
counterparts. In many cases, it is preferable to deal with the
probabilistic formulation of a concept even when applying it to a
relational database. For example, we define a new project-join mapping
for relational databases that is based on transforming a relational to
a probabilistic database. This mapping is shown to have more fixed
points than the standard one." ,

abstract=	"We investigate the fundamental problem of when a
ground atom in a disjunctive database is assumed false. There are
basically two different approaches for inferring negative information
for disjunctive databases; they are Minker's Generalized Closed World
Assumption (GCWA) and Ross and Topor's Disjunctive Database Rule
(DDR). A problem with the GCWA is that disjunctive clauses are
sometimes interpreted exclusively, even when they are intended for
inclusive interpretation. On the other hand, the DDR always interprets
disjunctive clauses inclusively. We argue that neither approach is
satisfactory. Whether a disjunctive clause is interpreted exclusively
or inclusively should be specified explicitly. Negative information
should then be inferred according to the stated intent of the
disjunctive clauses. A database semantics called PWS is proposed to
solve the aforementioned problem. We also show that for propositional
databases with no negative clauses, the problem of determining if a
negative ground literal is inferred under the GCWA is co-NP-hard,
while the same problem can be solved efficiently under the DDR and
PWS. However, in the general case, the problem becomes co-NP-complete
for the DDR and PWS. Relationships among GCWA, DDR, and PWS are
highlighted. In general, disjunctive clauses are interpreted
inclusively under the DDR and unpredictably under the GCWA. We also
characterize when the GCWA interprets disjunctive clauses exclusively.
Throughout this paper, we assume that both the head and the body of a
clause consists of atoms only." ,

join operations. Their effectiveness is first shown by means of an
example; then some comparisons with standard procedures are made,
showing promising results. The inclusion of these techniques in the
relational query processing environment requires a broader view of the
evaluation phase, where more than one expression can now be present. A
heuristic algorithm for the reduction of the number of candidate

intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear: (1) the search for
meaningful units that are as small as possible - atomic semantics; (2)
the search for meaningful units that are larger than the usual n-ary
relation - molecular semantics. In this paper we propose extensions to
the relational model to support certain atomic and molecular

database management systems are incapable of representing and
manipulating the imprecise, incomplete, and vague information that is
typically encountered in complex problem domains. Fuzzy relational
databases have been developed to increase the flexibility in the
representation of domain information. The different models of fuzzy
relations and their roles in the framework of fuzzy relational
database management systems are reviewed. The applicability of fuzzy
relational database techniques as a methodology for approximate
reasoning is examined. Many similarities exist in the processes that
are used for fuzzy relational operations and those of approximate
reasoning; however, the goals are often different. In fuzzy relational
database theory, the objective is measuring similarity. For
approximate reasoning, the objective is determining maximal
compatibility. Several classes of similarity measures are examined to
determine their appropriateness as compatibility measures in
approximate reasoning. " ,

meet the intent of a schema but not the schema definition, represent a
small proportion of the database extension, and may become known only
after the schema is in use. Admission of exceptional conditions is
argued to suggest a representation that locally stretches the schema
definition by use of relations with embedded subrelations. Attempted
normalization of these relations to 1NF does not yield the static
schema typically associated with such transformations. A class of
relations, termed Exceptional Condition Nested Form (ECNF), is defined
which allows the necessary representation of exceptional conditions
while containing sufficient restrictions to prevent arbitrary and
chaotic inclusion of embedded subrelations. Queries on a subset of
exceptional conditions, the exceptional constraints, are provided an
interpretation via an algorithm that transforms ECNF relations into
1NF relations containing two types of null values. Extensions of
relational algebraic operators, suitable for interactive query
navigation, are defined for use with ECNF relations containing all
forms of exceptional conditions." ,

abstract=	" Summary: A fuzzy set can be viewed as a
weighted-max combination or as a convex combination of a family of
nested ordinary sets. The latter point of view allows the
interpretation of a fuzzy set as a consonant random set. Then any
numerical set function applied to a fuzzy set leads to a result which
is a random number. The expectation attached to this random number
provides a scalar evaluation of the fuzzy set with respect to the
considered set function. This approach is very general and can be used
for various kinds of measurements: cardinality, confidence measures
attached to the occurrence of events, diameter or perimeter of a fuzzy
region, distance between two sets, etc. Also the fuzziness of the set
to be evaluated naturally induces a fuzzy set of possible evaluations,
and expected values of the lower and upper bounds of this fuzzy set of
numbers can be computed. The weighted max-combination view, which
leads to another type of scalar evaluation, is also briefly discussed.
In this paper the approach above is more particularly applied to the
treatment of queries asking for some global evaluation of a set of
items specified by means of a fuzzy property. This kind of query can
be managed by languages SQL in the case of a crisp set of items. When
this set is fuzzily specified, a scalar answer can still be provided
as well as a fuzzy-valued or interval-valued one if we want to keep
track of the effect of the fuzziness of the query. The case where the
data base contains precise information is considered, as well as the
more general case of fuzzy information data bases. " ,

concepts of temporal entities and temporal events and extend the
conventional crisp notion of events to define generalized events. We
also note that there are two broad categories of temporal operators,
those which operate on temporal entities and those which operate on
temporal events. We provide new definitions for temporal operators
used for generalized events. We choose a temporal data model which is
independent of conventional data models, but is similar to temporal
data models proposed by other researchers and is sufficiently general
to be applied to suitable extensions of conventional data models. We
show how to combine different generalized events and apply temporal
operators to such compound events. An outline of a possible
implementation of our ideas in the relational data model is also

defended on the grounds that by defining several additional unary

proposed unary operators contribute to the conceptual utility of the
4VL by providing an explicit way for users to relate familiar results
of two-valued logic to analogous results in 4VL." ,

storing default values (instead of null values) in place of missing

default values in corresponding fields of corresponding tables. For
valued logic is used so that the logical status of the default data
values can be described as, not just true or false, but also as
inapplicable or unknown. This method, in contrast to the ``hidden
byte'' approach, has two important advantages: (1) Because the logical
status of all data is represented explicitly in tables, all 4-valued
operations can be handled via a 2-valued data manipulation language,
such as SQL. Language extensions for handling missing data (e.g., ``Is
NULL'') are not necessary. (2) Because data fields always contain a
default value (as opposed to a null value or mark), it is possible to
do arithmetic across missing data and to interpret the logical status
of the result by means of logical operations on the corresponding
stored truth values." ,

approximation to the true result. The aim is to get a precise
approximation. We regard databases as many-sorted algebras. Based on
the concept of extended algebra we define what it means for an algebra
to approximate another algebra. We then give the following simple
principle for extending query languages to handle missing data:
``Whenever information is added to an incomplete database subsequent
answers to queries must not be contradictory or less informative than
previously.'' We then apply this principle to extend the functional
query language Varqa. Finally, we compare the previously proposed
many-valued logic systems with the system devised based on our
principles." ,

portions of a traditional closed world database as open-world.
Attributes, part of a relation, or entire relations can be explicitly
defined as ``open'' through the insertion of null-values. Under this
assumption, we consider three different types of null values: the
standard {\em unknown}, {\em does not exist}, and the new one, called
{\em open}. We give a complete formal specification of the semantics
of these null values. We extend the arithmetic and logical operators
to cover nulls and outline how relational operators can be extended
accordingly. This paper describes ongoing work. We state some open
problems to be solved in order to render our approach more
operational." ,

representing the set of possible worlds in a fashion that is suitable
for storing and processing the database. We have complemented the
representation hierachy with a construct called Horn tables. The class
of Horn tables is algebraically closed under any set of total
dependencies, and it is the only class in the hierarchy with this
property (apart from the top elements in the hierachy, which is of
theoretical interest only). All sets of dependencies consisting of
equality generating dependencies and one join dependency can be
efficiently incorporated into a Horn table. The certain answer to any
datalog query can be evaluated in polynomial time in the size of the
Horn table. The same is true for the possible answer to any positive
existential query. If one is concerned only with certain answers to
datalog queries, any set of dependencies can be efficiently
incorporated into a Horn table so that no corruption of the
information occurs w.r.t. the answers. " ,

within a framework of database theories which contains the domain

addition, for negative information we use a Generalized Closed World
Assumption. Queries are also formulas in first-order logic, while
possible answers are disjunctions of tuples. We give an algorithm to
check if a candidate answer is in fact an answer. We also develop an
algorithm to find all minimal answers to a query. We show how the
problem of null values can be investigated as a special case of
incomplete information." ,

sound, even in the presence of incomplete information. Thus the merits
of doing consistent judgements in uncertain domains and the advantages
of modularity and incrementality of rule-based application development
come together. We also can offer mechanisms to trace down collections
of uncertain rules. As next-generation applications will have to
handle vast amounts of uncertain data, an integration into databases
is mandatory. We give a direct implementation of our calculus on top
of a database system with a DATALOG-interface. In this way we extend
current database technology towards providing new applications with
new suitable primitives and with a database platform for coping with
uncertainty." ,

for any decision making done by an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)

ITSs still have ``generalized'' student models which represent a type

representative of each individual student, the goal of providing
individualized tutoring cannot be attained. In this paper we describe
an Intelligent Fuzzy Temporal Relational Database (IFTReD), an
intelligent system-independent SR which allows for almost any degree
of individualization the designer wishes to incorporate. It is
anticipated that this IFTReD will provide a significant improvement
over standard AI storage techniques for the SR. These improvements
will be realized in terms of: (1) intelligence; (2) greater storage
efficiency; (3) greater speed in retrieval and query; (4) ability to
handle linguistic codes, ranges, fuzzy possibilities, and incomplete
data in student models; (5) friendliness of query language; (6)
availability of temporal knowledge to give a history of past
performance; and (7) a more holistic view of the student permitting
greater individualization of the tutor." ,

expands, database systems are being directly handled more and more by
nonprofessionals. In this field, it is important that friendly
user-interfaces are provided. It has been found that nonprocedural
ways of describing queries such as QBE are preferred. A further step
toward attaining a higher degree of user-friendliness would be the
development of a way of enabling the system to perform a flexible
interpretation of queries usually specified definitely by the user. A
flexible interpretation is necessary so that data items which are
semantically close to an exact match with the query conditions can be
obtained. This paper presents a relational database system, ARES,
which has the capability of performing a flexible interpretation of
queries. In ARES, relational operations have been functionally
augmented with an additional comparison operator which implies
''approximately equal to'' or ``similar to'' for cases in which the
user expects the system to perform a flexible interpretation of the
query conditions. The functional augmentation is simply achieved by a
combination of conventional relational operations. ARES is now in
actual operation in a research environment, and will contribute to the
next step of our research toward implementation of highly intelligent
data processing facilities beyond the present scope of database
technology." ,

relational model of data. Formulated are precise conditions that
should be satisfied in a semantically meaningful extension of the
usual relational operators, such as projection, selection, union, and
join, from operators on tables with ``null values'' of various kinds
allowed. These conditions require that the system be safe in the sense
that no incorrect conclusion is derivable by using a specified subset
$\Omega$ of the relational operators; and that it be complete in the
sense that all conclusions expressible by relational expressions using
operators in $\Omega$ are in fact derivable in this system. Two such
systems of practical interest are shown. The first, based on the usual
Codd's null values, supports projection and selection. The second,
based on many different (``marked'') null values or variables allowed
to appear in a table, is shown to correctly support projection,
positive selection (with no negation occurring in the selection
condition), union, and renaming of attributes, which allows for
processing arbitrary conjunctive queries. A very desirable property
enjoyed by this system is that all relational operators on tables are
performed in exactly the same way as in the case of the usual
relations. A third system, mainly of theoretical interest, supporting
projection, selection, union, join, and renaming, is also discussed.
Under a so-called closed world assumption, it can also handle the
operator of difference. It is based on a device called a conditional
table and is crucial to the proof of the correctness of the second
system. All systems considered allow for relational expressions
containing arbitrarily many different relation symbols, and no form of
the universal relation assumption is required." ,

each design or schedule, and queries can either be evaluated in the

abstract=	" To handle incomplete data in Database and
Information systems is a nontrivial problem. There is no fully
satisfactory design theory incorporating null values in Relational
Database systems. In this paper we present our multivalued logical
proposal to deal with null values in Relational Datanases. This method
is different from classifying nulls into multi categories, such as
Codd's four valued logic which classified nulls into applicable and
inapplica ble nulls, respectively. We believe that four valued logic
cannot cover all possible nulls, and neither can n+1 valued logic. Our
multivalued logical approach is based on traditional three valued
logic, which gives each null value a possible truth degree. The result
of a query will depend on truth degrees of the nulls involved, giving
a 'probabilistic' response to the query. To deal with null values of
various truth degrees we introduce an augmented set of relational and
logical operations. An arithematic operation approach for nulls is
introduced, which we believe can be extended for traditional
relational algebra. To simplify the handling of nulls by a RDBMS, a
measurement of null truth level is proposed. According to the truth
level of a null, RDBMS can decide whether to use it in calculation or
ignore it. " ,

user's query (which may be ill-defined), into a complete query graph
which provides the detailed description of the query, allowing
corrective responses. An intermediate query language (IQL) has been
developed to serve as input to the translator. The translator has been
implemented using Interlisp-D, and its performance has been
demonstrated. " ,

provide a rigorous treatment of the issue of evidential independence,

this issue has not been addressed before in the literature on
quantitative logic programming. In expert systems evidential
independence received only an ad hoc treatment, while the approaches
found in the theory of evidential reasoning are feasible only in small
scale systems. We discuss the problem of query optimization and, as a
first-step, present a quantitative semi-naive query evaluation
algorithm -- generalization of a method well-known in deductive
databases. Treatment of negation and conflicting evidence based on, so
called, support logic is given in the last part of the paper, where we

enable definite responses to queries on the basis of 'common sense'

information is termed an extension. Although such an extension is
self- consistent, in general two or more mutually inconsistent
extensions can arise. We characterise the rules and defaults of a

emphasize that the fuzzy meanings of linguistic data can change with
time; we call this property temporal-fuzziness. The major problems
arising from the lack of the ability to handle this property have been
studied, i.e. users and databases misinterpret the meaning of data.
Thus, it is essential to treat temporal-fuzziness within an
appropriate framework like ours. In our work, we employ concepts based
on fuzzy set theory - possibility theory and linguistic variables -
for modeling and evaluating uncertain/imprecise data from three domain
types, i.e.. quantitative, qualitative, and multivalued logic data
domains. To model past data, the tuple time stamping method and the
discrete time conceptual model are utilized. We introduce three kinds
of measures for each domain type to evaluate data. They can provide
upper bounded, lower bounded, and approximate answers to queries.
Then, Temporal Fuzzy Data Model and a metadatabase are proposed. The
condept of metadatabase allows the time-variant property of fyzzy
meanings to be modeled. Since based on the relational model, our model
has a uniform and simple structure." ,

abstract=	"Various approaches to interpreting queries in a
database with incomplete information are discussed. A simple model of
a database is described, based on attributes which can take values in
specific attribute domains. Information incompleteness means that
instead of having a single value of an attribute, we have a subset of
the attribute domain, which represents our knowledge that the actual
value, though unknown, is one of the values in this subset. This
extends the idea of Codd's null value corresponding to the case when
this subset is the whole attribute domain. A simple query language to
communicate with such a system is described and its various semantics
are precisely defined. We emphasize the distinction between two
different interpretations of the query language -- the external one,
which refers the queries directly to the real world modeled in an
incomplete way by the system, and the internal one, under which the
queries refer to the system's information about this world rather than
to the world itself. Both external and internal interpretations are
provided with the corresponding sets of axioms which serve as a basis
for equivalent transformations of queries. The technique of equivalent
transformations of queries is then extensively exploited for
evaluating the interpretation of (i.e. the response to) a query" ,

incomplete information database are investigated. A simple query
language is described, and its semantics, which refers the queries to
the information about reality contained in a database, rather than to
reality itself, is defined. This approach, called the internal
interpretation, is shown to lead in a natural way to the notions of a
topological Boolean algebra and a model logic related to S4 in the
same way as referring queries directly to reality (external
interpretation) leads to Boolean algebras and classical logic. An
axiom system is given for equivalent (with respect to the internal
interpretation) transformation of queries, which is then exploited as
a basic tool in a method for computing the internal interpretation for
a broad class of queries. An interesting special case of the problem
of determining the internal interpretation amounts to deciding whether
an assertion about reality (a ``yes-no'' query) is consistent with the
incomplete information about reality contained in a database. A
solution to this problem, which relies on the classical combinatorial
problem of distinct representatives of subset, is given." ,

abstract=	" Answering queries in indefinite systems is a
difficult problem both computationally, since it involves non-Horn
clauses and factoring, and conceptually, concerning producting beliefs
for formulas not derivable from the system. To provide a basis for
reasonable beliefs, we propose new criteria as an alternative to the
Full Information Principle. Then an approach to producing stable
beliefs, called Plausible World Assumption (PWA), is introduced. It is
shown how a set of non-Horn clauses can be transformed into a set of
so called singleton-head-rules such that evaluation of a given query
is reduced to processing of a set of Horn clauses relevant to the
query. Finally, algorithms are presented for computing facts and
beliefs for atomic queries in accord with the PWA. This method is
shown to be more efficient than the known techniques for query
evaluation in indefinite systems. " ,

abstract=	"A database is said to be indefinite if there is an
answer to a query of the form $P(a) \Or P(b)$ where neither $P(a)$ nor
$P(b)$ can be derived from the database. Indefinite databases arise
where, in general, the data consists of non-Horn clauses. A clause is
non-Horn if it is a disjunction of literals in which more than one
literal in the clause is positive. Horn databases, which comprise most
databases in existence, do not admit answers of the form $P(a) \Or
P(b)$ where neither $P(a)$ nor $P(b)$ are derivable from the database.
It has been shown by Reiter that in such databases one can make an
assumption, termed the Closed World Assumption (CWA), that to prove
that $\not P(a)$ is true, one can try to prove $P(a)$, and if the
proof for $P(a)$ fails, one can assume $\not P(a)$ is true. When a
database consists of Horn and non-Horn clauses, Reiter has shown that
it is not possible to make the CWA. In this paper we investigate
databases that consist of Horn and non-Horn clauses. We extend the
definition of CWA to apply to such databases. The assumption needed
for such databases is termed the Generalized Closed World Assumption
(GCWA). Syntactic and semantic definitions of generalized closed
worlds are given. It is shown that the two definitions are equivalent.
In addition, given a class of null values it is shown that the GCWA
gives a correct interpretation for null values." ,

missing or imprecisely known or when an attribute is not applicable to

exceptions is necessary. The approach taken here is to allow any
attribute value to be a regular precise value, a string denoting that
the value is missing, a string denoting that the attribute is not
applicable, or an imprecise value. The imprecise values introduce
uncertainty into query evaluation, since it is no longer obvious which
objects should be retrieved. To handle the uncertainty, two set of
objects are retrieved in response to every query: the set of objects
that are known to satisfy with complete certainty and the set that
possibly satisfies the query with various degrees of uncertainty. Two
methods of estimating this uncertainty, based on information theory,
are proposed. The measure of uncertainty is used to rank objects for
presentation to a user." ,

accompanied with such detailed certifications of their integrity are
more meaningful. First, the model is defined and discussed. Then, a

evaluation is sound (i.e., no incorrect results are derivable) in the
Imielinski-Lipski sense. None of the models is complete (i.e., all
valid conclusions are derivable) in the Imielinski-Lipski sense. We
briefy compare two of the models in the family with other approaches.
Considering each table tuple as a set of d-dimensional cubes, each
model in the family of models presented in this paper can be
considered and implemented as a geometric database model. We briefly
summarize the geometric operations and the primitive update semantics
that need to be utilized in such an implementation." ,

with advantages and disadvantages. The function of information implied
by these forms is described in terms of the business process model.
This model is the basis of a proposed data scheme that organizes
information ``top-down'' into the core of a flexible, effective,

capabilities could be greatly enhanced if there were real-time/online

the data gathered is so large that arguments have been raised for
processing the data on-the-fly during the execution of an experiment
or an application. Processing the data on-the-fly puts a time
constraint on query evaluation, i.e., queries must be processed in
fixed time-units and, for some experiments, in real-time. The efforts
at Case Western Reserve Univ. to build a methodology for synthetic
(approximate) query response construction (a) under real-time/online
time constraints, and (b) with real-time/online incomplete data

formulating the database semantics both with a model-theoretic flavor

the connection between Lipski's approach to incomplete information

extended by introducing [0,1]-valed levels of possibility in order to
take into account the fact that our incomplete knowledge about
properties of objects in databases may be based on soft (non-binary)
information or on statistical-like data. Moreover, possibility theory,
enlarged by the introduction of the concept of necessity, seems easier
to manipulate that the semantics of usual modal logic used by Lipski.
The problems of dependencies, of ``yes--no'' queries or of queries
involving the cardinalities of specified sets when available
information is incomplete are considered. Two illustrative examples
are dealt with." ,

as impreciseness in the association among them. Relational operators
for fuzzy relations have been studied, and applicability of fuzzy
logic in capturing integrity constraints has been investigated. By
introducing a fuzzy resemblance measure EQUAL for comparing domain
values, the definition of classical functional dependency has been
generalized to fuzzy functional dependency ({\bf ff}d. The implication
problem of {\em ff}ds has been examined and a set of sound and
complete inference axioms has been proposed. Next, the problem of
lossless join decomposition of fuzzy relations for a given set of
fuzzy functional dependencies is investigated. It is proved that with
a suitable restriction on EQUAL, the design theory of a classical
relational database with functional dependencies can be extended to
fuzzy relations satisfying fuzzy functional dependencies." ,

We extend the traditional theory and study the properties of extended

the meaning of ``empty set'' is clarified. Finally, contrary to
several previous results, we determine that the traditional

in deductive databases from a semantic point of view. We want to treat
the problem in a homogeneous way, using a formalism which can handle
different types of incompleteness. We argue that it is convenient to
define an incomplete database as a double entity; an underlying
incomplete database together with selection criteria, formally some
preference relation on the set of models of the underlying database,
intended to reduce the incompleteness. Such an idea has been already
exploited in the Perfect Model semantics of Negation as Failure in the
stratified databases. We propose another notion of preference which
induces a stronger selection of models and captures an intuitive
process of ``making choices'' in disjunctive databases. We study both
the declarative and the operational semantics for this notion of
preference." ,

concepts of relevance to the Student Record Component of an
Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction system (ICAI). The Student
Record (SR) is an essential part of any ICAI system, since its task is
to capture the system's knowledge about the student in general, and
his abilities in the domain to be taught and his development over time
during the whole sequence of sessions in particular. This paper
proposes a relational representation as an underlying model for a
Student Record and then extends this by allowing a set-valued
extension of the representation and by finally also adding temporal
aspects to this relational representation. The impact of these two
enhancements of the relational data model on the representation and on
the manipulation is analyzed; and then the relational algebra, a query
language for the relational data model, is extended to cope with these
aspects. The result is a fuzzy temporal retrieval. An essential
feature of this approach is that the operations of this query language
default to their crisp non-temporal counterparts if no fuzzy or
temporal extensions are specified in them. Altogether, a set-valued
temporal relational representation schema with a fuzzy temporal
retrieval is presented, which is claimed to be of use as a knowledge
representation schema for other Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications. It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding
of fuzzy set and relational database theory." ,

instead, operations based on some kind of nearness measures to be
established for each domain for the evaluation of queries made upon
them. An investigation of proposed nearness measures, often fuzzy
equivalences, is conducted. The unnaturalness and impracticality of
these measures leads to the development of a new measure: the

of the art in the representation and manipulation of imprecise and
uncertain information by automated processing systems. To contrast
their objectives and characteristics with the sound deductive
procedures of classical logic, methodologies developed for that
purpose are usually described as relying on approximate reasoning.
Using a unified descriptive framework, we will argue that, far from
being mere approximations of logically correct procedures, approximate
reasoning methods are also sound techniques that describe the
properties of a set of conceivable states of a real-world system. This
framework, which is bases on the logical notion of possible worlds,
permits the description of various approximate reasoning methods and
techniques and simplifies their comparison. More importantly, our
descriptive model facilitates the understanding of the fundamental
conceptual characteristics of the major methodologies. We examine
first the development of approximate reasoning methods from early
advances to the present state of the art, commenting also on the
technical motivation for the introduction of certain controversial
approaches. Our unifying semantic model is then introduced to explain
the formal concepts and structures of the major approximate reasoning
methodologies: classical probability calculus, the Dempster-Shafer
calculus of evidence, and fuzzy (possibilistic) logic. In particular,
we discuss the basic conceptual differences between probabilistic and
possibilistic approaches. Finally, we take a critical look at the
controversy about the need and utility for diverse methodologies, and
asses requirements for future research and development." ,

abstract=	"This dissertation presents a linguistic approach,
based on test-score semantics and fuzzy logic, to the problem of fuzzy
temporal inference in question answering systems. While several models
have been proposed for the analysis of historical information, little
research has been done satisfactorily on the manipulation of fuzzy
temporal quantifiers such as 'a few days ago,' which refers to
absolute count, and 'often,' which refers to relative count. In this
dissertation, the theory of possibility is taken as an appropriate
framework for dealing with such a problem. The first step of the
approach for statements with absolute-count temporal quantifiers only,
is to translate these statements into their corresponding possibility
assignment equations using test-score semantics. Time information
among events can then be inferred from these equations by deriving its
possibility distribution. The compositional rule of inference plays
the central role in solving the equations. The algorithm for computing
the compositional rule can be transformed into one similar to Gaussian
elimination for the solution of linear equations. This method is
straightforward but inefficient. An improved technique is proposed
which represents all quantifiers by fuzzy numbers and replaces the
rule of composition with fuzzy addition. With this technique the
desired possibility distribution can be obtained by applying a
generalized Warshall's algorithm on the Time-Relation-Matrix, which is
a representation for given information. As for quantifiers which refer
to relative count, such as 'often,' fuzzy multiplication will play the
primary role. Finally, all mechanisms amount to a fuzzy temporal
logic, which serves as an inference tool for temporal information
analysis. This computational approach to fuzzy temporal quantifiers
has the following advantages. 1) It subsumes those approaches based on
two valued logic as limiting cases. 2) It deals uniformly with the
relative and absolute time relations. 3) It is easy to implement. 4)
It can be generalized to apply to other quantifiers used in different
concepts such as temperature and distance." ,

Buckles and F.E. Petry is a formal method for organizing and using

has a unique result. The orginal fuzzy relational database model was
based on similarity relations which were defined on finite scalar
domains. Buckles and Petry later extended the model to incorporate
fuzzy number domains; this extension was done without loss of
consistency with the representation or the relational algebra. In a
recent paper we have extended the original model to proximity
relations which generalize similarity relations; the key properties of
Buckles and Petry's model are preserved in the extension. In this work
we demonstrate that the existence of partitions on finite scalar
domains in the fuzzy relational model is the key to preserving the
important properties of the classical relational model. We explain how
proximity relations defined on finite scalar domains are used to
partition the domains. Further, we show that normal fuzzy sets can be
employed as domain values. These fuzzy sets become members of finite
scalar domains, and their characteristic functions are employed in
generating the proximity relations of the fuzzy relational database

to problems from the field of decision-making, data analysis,
knowledge representation, expert systems etc. Several applications
(particularly in medical diagnosis and engineering control) confirm
the usefulness of the rough sets idea. Rough classification concerns
objects described by multiple attributes in a so-called information
system. Traditionally, the information system is assumed to be
complete, i.e. the descriptors are not missing and are supposed to be
precise. In this paper we investigate the case of incomplete
information systems, and present a generalization of the rough sets
approach which deals with missing and imprecise descriptors. " ,

programming, with negations allowed to appear both in the head of a
clause and in the body. As such programs can easily contain
inconsistent information (with respect to the intuitions of two-valued
logic), this means that the formalism allows reasoning about systems
that are intuitively inconsistent but yet have models (in nonclassical
model theory). Such an ability is important because inconsistencies
may occur very easily during the design and development of deductive
databases and/or expert systems. The author also develops a theory of
disjunctive deductive databases that (perhaps) contain inconsistent
information. The author shows how to associate, with any such
database, an operator that maps MV-model states to MV-model states. It
is shown that this operator has a least fixed point which is identical
to the set of all variable- free disjunctions that are provable from
the database under consideration. A procedure to answer queries to
such databases is devised. Soundness and completeness results are
proved. The techniques introduced are fairly general. However, the
results are applicable to databases that are quantitative in nature. " ,

are externally interpreted in some incomplete first-order structures

structure with dependencies which seems to be an adequate model of
data bases with incomplete information. We show that the widely
accepted implicit assumption that first-order models (of a data base)
have a unique domain, has no first-order consequences if the set of
premises (represented in the data base) contains only a finite amount
of information explicitly involving the elements of this domain. This
observation allows us to evaluate the degree of unsolvability of the
problem of answering externally interpreted queries in the incomplete
first-order structures. Moreover, we propose a forcing-based
definition of the internal interpretation of modal queries in such
structures, and investigate some of the properties of this
interpretation. " ,

the fuzzy matching degrees that assigns the appropriate values in the
interval to any combination of fuzzy queries and tuples in relational
databases. FQL helps to provide a human-oriented interface to
relational databases that store a vast amount of information.
Furthermore, fuzzy expert systems are expected to be provided with the
facility to make use of fact data in relational databases through FQL.
In addition, FQL is a theoretical basis for systematically developing
a higher human-oriented interface with relational databases. " ,

several researchers. However, the study of the OODB has just begun,
and there are few investigations about the database schema design in
the OODB. In this paper, we show fundamental ideas and methods to
achieve schema design, update propagation, view implementation and the

to the uncertainties of partial values, the extended divisions may
produce maybe tuples. To process this extended division, we decompose
a relation consisting of partial values into a set of relations

interpretation. Bipartite graph matching techniques are then applied
to develop efficient algorithms for the extended division that handles

answering interesting queries in this framework has been shown to be
almost assuredly intractable. We show that when the representation
language is sufficiently restricted we can develop efficient
algorithms for answering interesting classes of queries including: (i)
determining whether a formula involving temporal relations between
events is possibly true and necessarily true; and (ii) answering
aggregation questions where the set of all events that satisfy a
formula are retrieved. We also show, by examining applications of the
interval algebra discussed in the literature, that our restriction on
the representation language often is not overly restrictive in
practice. " ,

abstract=	"Suppose one wishes to construct, use, and maintain
a database of facts about the real world, even though the state of
that world is only partially known. In the artificial intelligence
domain, this problem arises when an agent has a base set of beliefs
that reflect partial knowledge about the world, and then tries to
incorporate new, possibly contradictory knowledge into this set of
beliefs. In the database domain, one facet of this situation is the
well-known null values problem. We choose to represent such a database
as a logical theory, and view the models of the theory as representing
possible states of the world that are consistent with all known
information. How can new information be incorporated into the
database? For example, given the new information that ``{\em b} or
{\em c} is true,'' how can one get rid of all outdated information
about {\em b} and {\em c}, add the new information, and yet in the
process not disturb any other information in the database? In
current-day database management systems, the difficult and tedious
burden of determining exactly what to add and remove from the database
is placed on the user. The goal of our research was to relieve users
of that burden, by equipping the database management system with
update algorithms that can automatically determine what to add and
remove from the database. Under our approach, new information about
the state of the world is input to the database management system as a
well-formed formula that the state of the world is now known to
satisfy. We have constructed database update algorithms to interpret
this update formula and incorporate the new information represented by
the formula into the database without further assistance from the
user. In this paper we show how to embed the incomplete database and
the incoming information in the language of mathematical logic,
explain the semantics of our update operators, and discuss the
algorithms that implement these operators." ,

recognizes the close connections between probabilistic and
vector-based approaches. It is explicitly shown that both the standard
and generalized vector space models are special cases of the proposed
probabilistic inference model. Our method is applicable to any basic
concepts from an indexing scheme. Furthermore, it provides a
theoretical basis for the vector-based relevance feedback models, and
has the additional advantage that no ad hoc parameters are needed. The
new approach gives a plausible explanation for adopting a linear
measure (discriminant function) for decision making in general,

approaches do not provide an adequate model for modes of reasoning
which are approximate rather than exact. Most modes of human reasoning
and all of common sense reasoning fall into this category. Fuzzy
Logic, which may be viewed as an extension of classical logical
systems, provides an effective conceptual framework for dealing with
the problem of knowledge representation in an environment of
uncertainty and imprecision. Meaning representation in fuzzy logic is
based on test-score semantics. In this semantics, a proposition is
interpreted as a system of elastic constraints, and reasoning is
viewed as elastic constraint propagation. Our paper presents a summary
of the basic concepts and techniques underlying the application of
fuzzy logic to knowledge representation and describes a number of
examples relating to its use as a computational system for dealing
with uncertainty and imprecision in the context of knowledge, meaning,

and efficient strategy for evaluating queries in the presence of nulls

abstract=	"The aim of data base management system designers
is to provide the user with the ability to store data that can be used
in deriving information satisfying the user's information needs.
Information provided by data bases is frequently used as an input in
decision making and problem solving in uncertain environments. Human
beings deal with uncertainty by applying approximate reasoning which
enables them to deal with uncertainty and imprecise, incomplete, or
vague information. Therefore, there is a need for information systems
and expert systems that allow representation and manipulation of
imprecise information in order to model human reasoning. Furthermore,
it is desirable that such systems provide means for
``individualization'' to reflect the user's perception of data and the
information requirements. The fuzzy relational data base (FRDB) model
presented in this paper is based on research in the fields of
relational data bases and theories of fuzzy sets and possibility. It
is designed to satisfy the need for individualization and imprecise
information processing. After introduction to the underlying theory,
the FRDB model architecture and query language are presented. Finally,
the possible applications of the FRDB in imprecise information
processing are discussed." ,

abstract=	" FILIP (fuzzy intelligent learning information
processing) system is designed with the goal to model human
information processing. The issues addressed are uncertain knowledge
representation and approximate reasoning based on fuzzy set theory,
and knowledge acquisition by 'being told' or by 'learning from
examples'. Concepts that can be 'learned' by the system can be
imprecise (fuzzy), or the knowledge can be incomplete. In the latter
case, FILIP uses the concept of similarity to extrapolate the
knowledge to cases that were not covered by examples provided by the
user. Concepts are stored in the knowledge base and employed in
intelligent query processing, based on flexible inference that
supports approximate matches between the data in the database and the
query. The architecture of FILIP is discussed, the learning algorithm
is described, and examples of the system's performance in the
knowledge acquisition and querying modes, together with its
explanatory capabilities are shown." ,

abstract=	"In real life it is very often the case that the
available knowledge is {\it imperfect} in the sense that it represents
multiple possible states of the external world, yet it is unknown
which state corresponds to the actual situation of the world.
Imperfect knowledge can be of two different categories. Knowledge is
{\it incomplete} if it represents different states, one of which is
true in the external world. On the contrary, knowledge is {\it
uncertain} if it represents different states which may be satisfied or
are likely to be true in the external world. Imperfect knowledge can
be considered under two different perspectives: using either an {\it
algebraic} or a {\it logical} approach. We present both approaches in
relation with the standard relational model, providing the necessary
background for the subsequent development. The study of imperfect
knowledge has been an active area of research, in particular in the
context of relational databases. However, due to the complexity of
manipulating imperfect knowledge, little practical results have been
obtained so far. In this thesis we provide a survey of the field of
incompleteness and uncertainty in relational databases; it can be used
also as an introductory tutorial for understanding the intuitive
semantics and the problems encountered when representing and
manipulating such imperfect knowledge. The survey concentrates in
giving an unifying presentation of the different approaches and
results found in the literature, thus providing a state of the art in
the field. The rest of the thesis studies in detail the manipulation
of one type of incomplete knowledge, namely {\it disjunctive
information}, and one type of uncertain knowledge, namely {\it
probabilistic information}. We study both types of imperfect knowledge
using similar approaches, that is through an algebraic and a logical
framework. The relational algebra operators are generalized for
disjunctive and probabilistic relations, and we prove the correctness
of these generalizations. In addition, disjunctive and probabilistic
databases are formalized using appropriate logical theories and we
give sound and complete query evaluation algorithms. A major
implication of these studies is the conviction that viewing
incompleteness and uncertainty as different facets of the same problem
would allow to achieve a deeper understanding of imperfect knowledge,
which is absolutely necessary for building information systems capable
of modeling complex real-life situations." ,

define their semantics. However, it is not possible to define
relational operators over probabilistic relations which yield
semantically correct results for arbitrary relational expressions. For
this reason, we define another kind of relations called {\it trace
relations} or, briefly, {\it t-relations}. Once the semantics of these
relations is defined, we prove that a relational algebra over
t-relations can be correctly defined. Thus, manipulating probabilistic
databases implies translating the database into t-relations, applying
relational operators over the t-relations, and translating the results
obtained into a probabilistic relation. The generalization proposed
can be incorporated into existing relational systems with the addition
of a component for manipulating propositional formulas." ,
