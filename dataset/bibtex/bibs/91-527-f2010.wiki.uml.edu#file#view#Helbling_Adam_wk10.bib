 abstract={ The author's of this paper present a novel idea for transmitting data from LCD screens to devices with cameras. They implement a system called PixNet which allows for 12 Mb/s data transfers up to a distance of 10 meters. This communication mechanism could be applied in areas where many devices exist with a single or a few LCD screens. },
