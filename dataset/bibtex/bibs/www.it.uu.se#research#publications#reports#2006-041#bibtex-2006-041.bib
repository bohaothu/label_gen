  abstract	= {A detailed model of the memory performance of a PDE solver
		  running on a NUMA-system is set up. Due to the complexity
		  of modern computers, such a detailed model inevitably is
		  very complicated. Therefore, approximations are introduced
		  that simplify the model and allows NUMA-systems and PDE
		  solvers to be described conveniently.
		  
		  Using the simplified model, it is shown that PDE solvers
		  using ordered local methods can be made very unsensitive to
		  high NUMA-ratios, allowing them to scale well on virtually
		  any NUMA-system.
		  
		  PDE solvers using unordered local methods, semiglobal
		  methods or global methods are more sensitive to high
		  NUMA-ratios and require special techniques in order to
		  scale well beyond a single locality group.
		  
		  Nevertheless, the potential performance gain of improving
		  the data distribution on a NUMA-system can be considerable
		  for all kinds of PDE solvers studied. }
