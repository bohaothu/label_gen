with many existing solutions. In later years, several methods have been proposed for mining
rules from sequential and temporal data. This paper presents a novel technique based on genetic
programming and specialised pattern matching hardware. The advantages of this method are its
flexibility and adaptability, and its ability to produce intelligible rules of considerable complexity."
