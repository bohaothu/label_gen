  abstract	= {Uncertainty coming from the noise in its neurons and the
		  ill-posed nature of many tasks plagues neural computations.
		  Maybe surprisingly, many studies show that the brain
		  manipulates these forms of uncertainty in a
		  probabilistically consistent and normative manner, and
		  there is now a rich theoretical literature on the
		  capabilities of populations of neurons to implement
		  computations in the face of uncertainty. However, one major
		  facet of uncertainty has received comparatively little
		  attention: time. In a dynamic, rapidly changing world, data
		  are only temporarily relevant. Here, we analyze the
		  computational consequences of encoding stimulus
		  trajectories in populations of neurons. For the most
		  obvious, simple, instantaneous encoder, the correlations
		  induced by natural, smooth stimuli engender a decoder that
		  requires access to information that is nonlocal both in
		  time and across neurons. This formally amounts to a ruinous
		  representation. We show that there is an alternative
		  encoder that is computationally and representationally
		  powerful in which each spike contributes independent
		  information; it is independently decodable, in other words.
		  We suggest this as an appropriate foundation for
		  understanding time-varying population codes. Furthermore,
		  we show how adaptation to temporal stimulus statistics
		  emerges directly from the demands of simple decoding. },

		  phase-resetting of ongoing activity. We investigated the
		  relationship between event-related oscillatory activity in
		  the alpha band and prestimulus levels of ongoing alpha
		  activity on {ERPs.} {EEG} was recorded from 23 participants
		  performing a visual discrimination task. Individuals were
		  assigned to one of three groups according to the amount of
		  prestimulus total alpha activity, and distinct differences
		  of the event-related {EEG} dynamics between groups were
		  observed. While all groups exhibited an event-related
		  increase in phase-locked (evoked) alpha activity, only
		  individuals with sustained prestimulus alpha activity
		  showed alpha-blocking, that is, a considerable decrease of
		  poststimulus non-phase-locked alpha activity. In contrast,
		  individuals without observable prestimulus total alpha
		  activity showed a concurrent increase of phase-locked and
		  non-phase-locked alpha activity after stimulation. Data
		  from this group seems to be in favor of an additive
		  event-related neuronal response without alpha-blocking.
		  However, the dissociable {EEG} dynamics of total and evoked
		  alpha activities together with a complementary simulation
		  analysis indicated a partial event-related reorganization
		  of ongoing brain activity. We conclude that both partial
		  phase-resetting and partial additive power contribute
		  dynamically to the generation of {ERPs.} The prestimulus
		  brain state exerts a prominent influence on event-related

		  Experimental and modeling studies demonstrate that each

		  interneurons. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the
		  resulting rhythmic network inhibition interacts with
		  excitatory input to pyramidal cells such that the more
		  excited cells fire earlier in the gamma cycle. Thus, the
		  amplitude of excitatory drive is recoded into phase values
		  of discharges relative to the gamma cycle. This recoding
		  enables transmission and read out of amplitude information
		  within a single gamma cycle without requiring rate
		  integration. Furthermore, variation of phase relations can
		  be exploited to facilitate or inhibit exchange of

		  synchronous neural oscillation associated with object
		  representation, attention, memory, and consciousness. The
		  most commonly reported {EEG} {iGBR} is a broadband
		  transient increase in power at the gamma range
		  {\textasciitilde}200-300 ms following stimulus onset. A
		  conspicuous feature of this {iGBR} is the trial-to-trial
		  poststimulus latency variability, which has been
		  insufficiently addressed. Here, we show, using single-trial
		  analysis of concomitant {EEG} and eye tracking, that this
		  {iGBR} is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary
		  miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic "spike
		  potential." The time course of the {iGBR} is related to an
		  increase in the rate of saccades following a period of
		  poststimulus saccadic inhibition. Thus, whereas neuronal
		  gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other
		  methods, the broadband transient {iGBR} recorded by scalp
		  {EEG} reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics
		  rather than neuronal oscillations.},
