		  concludes that while neither is adequate alone, nor

		  to address these questions by reviewing literature

		  of relevance as topical, user-oriented,
		  multidimensional, cognitive, and dynamic. We then
		  discuss traditional  assumptions on which most

		  definition based on alternative assumptions. The
		  dynamic, situational approach we suggest views the
		  user---regardless of system---as the central and
		  active determinant of the dimensions of
		  relevance. We believe that relevance is a
		  multidimensional concept; that it is dependent on
		  both internal (cognitive) and external (situational)
		  factors; that it is based on a dynamic human
		  judgement process; and that it is a complex but
		  systematic and measurable phenomenon."
