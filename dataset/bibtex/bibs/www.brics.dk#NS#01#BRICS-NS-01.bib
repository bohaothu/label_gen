                  Version~1.4 through a number of examples. Both
                  the classical decision procedure for the WS1S
                  logic and the MONA approach is explained. Also
                  the WS2S logic and the MONA concept of tree
                  automata is presented.\bibpar
                  Section~1 contains an introductory example and
                  a brief description of MONA applications. In
                  Section~2, the basic features of the MONA tool
                  are described through a number of examples.
                  Section~3 discusses the automaton-logic
                  connection and the MONA compilation semantics.
                  Section~4 describes DAGification, formula
                  reduction, and separate compilation. In
                  Section~5, it is shown how to make MONA produce
                  detailed information about the processing and
                  the resulting automata. Section~6 describes
                  some more advanced constructs, such as,
                  exporting and importing automata, controlling
                  restrictions, and emulating Presburger
                  arithmetic and M2L-Str. In Section~7, the
                  decision procedure for WS2S is presented along
                  with the MONA concept of Guided Tree Automata
                  and an extension with recursive types.
                  Section~8 discusses our plans for future work.
                  In the appendices, the full syntax is defined,
                  the command-line usage of MONA is shown, and
                  the MONA DFA, GTA, and BDD packages are
                  described.\bibpar
                  This 80 page manual is a revised edition of the
                  1.3~manual updating the survey of applications
                  and related work and adding documentation of
                  the newly implemented features, recursive types
                  for the tree-logic part and formula reductions.
                  Furthermore, a large number of minor
                  modifications and improvements have been made",
