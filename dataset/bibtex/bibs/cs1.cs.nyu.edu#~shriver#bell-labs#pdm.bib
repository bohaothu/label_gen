  abstract = {Problems whose data are too large to fit into main memory are
    called {\it out-of-core} problems.  Out-of-core parallel-I/O algorithms
    can handle much larger problems
    than in-memory variants and have much better performance than
    single-device variants.  However, they are not commonly used---partly
    because the understanding of them is not widespread.  Yet such algorithms
    ought to be growing in importance because they address the needs of
    users with ever-growing problem sizes and ever-increasing performance needs.

    This paper addresses this lack of understanding by presenting an
    introduction to the data-transfer models on which most of the
    out-of-core parallel-I/O
    algorithms are based, with particular emphasis on the Parallel Disk
    Model.  Sample algorithms are discussed to demonstrate the paradigms
    (algorithmic techniques) used with these models.

    Our aim is to provide insight into both the paradigms and the
    particular algorithms described, thereby also providing a background
    for understanding a range of related solutions.
    It is hoped that this background would enable
    the appropriate selection of existing algorithms and the development of
    new ones for current and future out-of-core problems.}
