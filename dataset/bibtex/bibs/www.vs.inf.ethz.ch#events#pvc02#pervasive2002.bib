  abstract = {Services are capabilities that enable applications and are of
  crucial importance to pervasive computing in next-generation networks.
  Service Composition is the construction of complex services from primitive
  ones; thus enabling rapid and flexible creation of new services. The presence
  of multiple independent service providers poses new and significant
  challenges. Managing trust across providers and verifying the performance of
  the components in composition become essential issues. Adapting the composed
  service to network and user dynamics by choosing service providers and
  instances is yet another challenge. In SAHARA1, we are developing a
  comprehensive architecture for the creation, placement, and management of
  services for composition across independent providers. In this paper, we
  present a layered reference model for composition based on a classification
  of different kinds of composition. We then discuss the different overarching
  mechanisms necessary for the successful deployment of such an architecture
  through a variety of case-studies involving composition.}

  the household domain. Typical lists include microwave ovens with integrated
  web-pads, refrigerators or washing machines with remote Internet connections
  for maintenance access, and even instrumented coffee mugs or clothes. While
  many of these examples have substantial entertainment value, the likelihood
  of their realization and pervasive deployment in the not too distant future
  is questionable. There is, however, another application domain for ubiquitous
  computing which holds substantial promise, but is often overlooked: the
  automotive sector. \par Cars are fairly attractive protagonists for
  ubiquitous computing: They are large enough to have communication devices
  integrated in them, in fact, a substantial portion of them has integrated
  phones today. They come with their own power source which can also feed their
  communica-tions equipment. Their price is some orders of magnitude higher
  than that of the device to be included, so the relative price increase to
  make them communicate is small. And, perhaps most importantly, some services
  such as mayday, remote tracking, or telediagnosis make vehicle connectivity
  desirable for car buyers and car manufacturers alike. \par In this talk, we
  discuss how ubiquitous computing in the automotive domain can become a
  reality. We investigate the principal services resulting from
  network-connected cars, focussing on vehicle-originated rather than
  passenger-related communication as we believe that ubiquitous computing is
  more about communicating machines than communicating humans. Within the
  vehicle-centric services identified, we distinguish between client/server and
  peer-to-peer applications, resulting in different communication requirements
  and system setups. We outline some network solutions to meet these
  requirements, including technologies for car-to-infrastructure and car-to-car
  communication in different regions of the world. We conclude by discussing
  the overall effect which these developments may have on the automotive
  industry.}

  Often, these difficulties are not apparent from the beginning. Nevertheless,
  difficulties are rarely addressed in the pervasive computing literature as
  they appear to be peripheral compared to the technical challenges. In this
  paper, we argue that the field would largely benefit from addressing these
  issues explicitly. First, focussed discussions would help identify areas that
  have already shown to be difficult or even intractable in related
  disciplines, such as AI or CSCW. Second, it would help developers become
  aware of the difficulties and would allow them to deliberately circumvent
  such areas. We use example scenarios from the pervasive computing literature
  to illustrate these points. Difficulties to describe and to analyze impacts
  of pervasive computing applications indicate a need for an analysis framework
  providing a specific terminology.}

  abstract = {With the increasing popularity of mobile computing devices, the
  need to access information in mobile environments has also grown rapidly. In
  order to support such mobile information accesses, location-based services
  and mobile information systems often rely on location-aware data management
  mechanisms like location-aware caching, data dissemination or prefetching. As
  we explain in this paper, the location-awareness of such mechanisms is only
  useful, if the accessed information is location-dependent, i.e. if the
  probability with that a certain information object is accessed depends on the
  user's location. \par Although the location-dependency of the accessed
  information is crucial for the efficiency of location-aware data management
  mechanisms and the benefit they can get out of their location-awareness, no
  metric to measure the location-dependency of information has been proposed so
  far. In this paper, we describe such a metric together with a second one for
  a further important characteristic of mobile information accesses, the
  so-called focus.}

  user to save and restore multiple independent snapshots of web sessions on a
  browser. At a later time, the user can retrieve any saved snapshot on a
  potentially different browser on a different device to continue any one of
  the chosen saved session in any order. The web session snapshot captures a
  complete browser running state, including the last page that appears on the
  browser, document object state, script state, values that a user enters in
  forms on the last page, browser history for back and forward pages, and
  cookies. BSR service consists of a browser plug-in that takes browser session
  snapshots, and a repository server that stores snapshots securely for each
  user. The main contribution of BSR service is that it decouples association
  between browser state and a device, in favor of association between browser
  state and its user.}

  tool that automatically generates content customization metadata on the basis
  of users' editing operations toward the desired results of the customization.
  A prototype of the metadata generator was developed for the generation of

  combines dynamic replica placement with a self-organizing application-level

  synthetic workloads and real Web server traces show that SCAN deploys close
  to an optimal number of replicas, achieves good load balance, and incurs a
  small delay and bandwidth penalty for update multicast relative to static
  replica placement on IP multicast. We envision that SCAN could enhance a

  avoid increasing complexity, and allow the user to concentrate on her tasks,

  their changing \emph{context}, including the user state and the physical and
  computational environment in which they run. Solar is a middleware platform
  to help these ``context-aware'' applications aggregate desired context from
  heterogeneous sources and to locate environmental services depending on the
  current context. By moving most of the context computation into the
  infrastructure, Solar allows applications to run on thin mobile clients more
  effectively. By providing an open framework to enable dynamic injection of
  context processing modules, Solar shares these modules across many
  applications, reducing application development cost and network traffic. By
  distributing these modules across network nodes and reconfiguring the
  distribution at runtime, Solar achieves parallelism and online load
  balancing.}
