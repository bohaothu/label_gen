		Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to a particular class of recursive
		functions over the reals with the flavour of Kleene's classical
		recursive function theory. We first consider the GPAC and several
		of its extensions to show that all these models have drawbacks and
		we introduce an alternative continuous-time model of computation
		that solves these problems. We also show that this new model
		preserves all the significant relations involving the previous
		models (namely, the equivalence with the differentially algebraic
		functions). We then continue with the topic of recursive
		functions over the reals, and we show full connections between
		functions generated by the model introduced so far and a particular
		class of recursive functions over the reals.}}

  abstract = {Computable analysis is the Turing machine based theory of
		computability on the real numbers and other topological spaces.
		Similarly as Ersov's concept of numberings can be used to deal with
		discrete structures, Kreitz and Weihrauch's concept of
		representations can be used to handle structures of continuum
		cardinality. In this context the choice of representations is very
		sensitively related to the underlying notion of approximation,
		hence to topology. In this paper we summarize some basic ideas of the
		representation based approach to computable analysis and we
		introduce an abstract and purely set theoretic characterization of
		this theory which can be considered as a generalization of the
		classical concept of $\mu$-recursive functions. Together with this
		characterization we introduce the notion of a perfect topological
		structure. In particular, these structures are effectively
		categorical, i.e. they characterize their own computability theory.
		Important examples of perfect structures are provided by metric
		spaces and additional attention is paid to their effective
		subsets.}
