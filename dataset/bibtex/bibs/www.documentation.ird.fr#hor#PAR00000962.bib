  abstract = {{T}he {W}orld {B}ank's {W}orld {D}evelopment {R}eport 2006 addresses equity and development, defining equity as respect for equal opportunities combined with the avoidance of absolute deprivation. {E}quity has up to now remained a marginal issue in development economics. {T}his detailed analysis endeavours to place the subject within the context of the evolution of {W}orld {B}ank thinking and policies. {T}he wealth of the concept is illustrated, the downside being the difficulty in defining it accurately. {W}e also emphasise the gap between the prospects opened up by such an enlargement of development goals and the report's policy recommendations, which are generally merely an extension of the {W}orld {B}ank's traditional analyses.},
