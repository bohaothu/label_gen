  abstract = {{T}his article offers a new approach of study about the fishing activity of the coastal seiners operating in the {J}ava {S}ea. {I}n 1995, about 20,100 investigations were carried out from some villages located along the north coast of the {I}sle of {J}ava. {F}rom these investigations, the fishing activity of some individual fishing units is analyzed daily; it allows to describe the different biases issued from this survey. {F}rom these individual schedule of activity, the main fishing strategies of this coastal fleet are presented.
