  abstract = {{M}any scientists working on pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites) are betting heavily on data generated by longitudinal genomic-transcriptomic-proteomic studies to explain biochemical host-vector-pathogen interactions and thus to contribute to disease control. {A}vailability of genome sequences of various organisms, from viruses to complex metazoans, led to the discovery of the functions of the genes themselves. {T}he postgenomic era stimulated the development of proteomic and bioinformatics tools to identify the locations, functions, and interactions of the gene products in tissues and/or cells of living organisms. {B}ecause of the diversity of available methods and the level of integration they promote, proteomics tools are potentially able to resolve interesting issues specific not only to host-vector-pathogen interactions in cell immunobiology, but also to ecology and evolution, population biology, and adaptive processes. {T}hese new analytical tools, as all new tools, contain pitfalls directly related to experimental design, statistical treatment, and protein identification. {N}evertheless, they offer the potency of building large protein-protein interaction networks for in silica, analysis of novel biological entities named "interactomes," a way of modeling host-vector-pathogen interactions to define new interference strategies.},
