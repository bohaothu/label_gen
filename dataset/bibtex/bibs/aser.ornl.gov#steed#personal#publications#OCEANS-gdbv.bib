	Abstract = {The Geophysical Data Base - Variable resolution (GDBV) is a 
modern, object-oriented data store that is designed to accommodate the 
dynamically derived parameters of the Geo-Acoustic Inversion Toolkit (GAIT). 
Sponsored by the Oceanographer of the Navy (CNO NO96) via PEO (C4I and Space) 
PMW-155, GAIT/GDBV is a Through-the-Sensor (TTS) program that includes a 
flexible data model for the assimilation of data at local, regional, and 
global levels of operation. In addition to its dynamic capabilities, GDBV 
also includes support for historical database roles similar to the Naval 
Oceanographic Office's (NAVOCEANO) Low Frequency Bottom Loss (LFBL) database. 
In order to demonstrate its highly extendable design, this paper explores 
GDBV's database format and data model. In both the historical and dynamic 
capacity, GDBV must be capable of evolving with new system specifications. 
GDBV's multiple levels of organization and object-oriented implementation 
provide an efficient solution for these requirements. In addition to its 
dynamic operational requirements, the GDBV database will accommodate the 
parameter definitions from each of the following Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Master Library (OAML) databases: High Frequency Bottom Loss (HFBL), LFBL, MIW 
Sediments and Roughness, LFBL's N-Layer dataset, and the Applied Physics 
Laboratory of the University of Washington's (APL-UW) GeoAcoustic Bottom 
Interaction Model (GABIM) Bottom Back Scatter (BBS) database. Support for 
these static databases enables the future evolution of each individual 
database into a single broad database that provides a complete description 
of the ocean bottom. The complete parameter set of GDBV is presented along 
with a physical representation of the parameters. The overall data flow is 
very similar to a preceding TTS system, PUMA-TEDS. This working example of 
GDBV in GAIT reinforces the portability of the database design and the 
benefits of generic TTS software design. GDBV is a modern database that 
provides a lightweight, highly portable data store with sophisticated 
features traditionally offered in large scale database management systems. 
In addition to fulfilling the requirements of the expanding GAIT algorithms, 
the generic implementation of GDBV will provide a valuable tool for a wide 
range of environmental data types, including those of future TTS programs.},
