In our experiments, we noticed that the 5 x 2 cv t test result may vary depending on factors that should not affect the test, and we propose a variant, the combined 5 x 2 cv F test, that combines multiple statistics to get a more robust test. Simulation results show that this combined version of the test has lower type I error and higher power than 5 x 2 cv proper.},

@INPROCEEDINGs{discretization,
	abstract = {Many supervised machine learning algorithms require a discrete feature space. In this paper, we review previous work on continuous feature discretization, identify defining characteristics of the methods, and conduct an empirical evaluation of several methods. We compare binning, an unsupervised discretization method, to entropy-based and purity-based methods, which are supervised algorithms. We found that the performance of the Naive-Bayes algorithm significantly improved when features were discretized using an entropy-based method. In fact, over the 16 tested datasets, the discretized version of Naive-Bayes slightly outperformed C4.5 on average. We also show that in some cases, the performance of the C4.5 induction algorithm significantly improved if features were discretized in advance; in our experiments, the performance never significantly degraded, an interesting phenomenon considering the fact that C4.5 is capable of locally discretizing features.},

After studying the paper, we realize that the paper correctly introduces the basic procedures and some of the most advanced ones when comparing a control method. However, it does not deal with some advanced topics in depth. Regarding these topics, we focus on more powerful proposals of statistical procedures for comparing n × n classifiers. Moreover, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining adjusted and comparable p-values in multiple comparison procedures.}
