           manage risk - Remember, everyone else is seeking to manage risk
           too. - They are all guessing; if they knew for certain, they would
           not be dealing with risk. - Their guesses are strongly influenced
           by their beliefs. - Their behaviour is strongly influenced by their
           guesses, {\em and} tends to reinforce their beliefs. - It is the
           behaviour of others, and the behaviour of nature, that constitute
           your risk environment. - Safety interventions that do not alter
           people's propensity to take risks will be frustrated by responses
           that re-establish the level of risk with which people were
           originally content. - In the absence of reductions in people's
           propensity to take risks, safety interventions will redistribute
           the burden or risk, not reduce it. - Potential safety benefits tend
           to get consumed as performance benefits. - For the forseeable
           future, nature will retain most of her secrets, and science will
           continue to invent new risks. - Human behaviour will always be
           unpredictable because it will always be responsive to human
           behaviour - including your behaviour. - It will never be possible
           to capture ``objective risk'', however powerful your computer,
           because the computer's predictions will be used to guide behaviour
           intended to influence that which is predicted. - {\em In the dance
           of the risk thermostats, the music never stops}.}

           USA. BACKGROUND: The TNM staging system originated as a response to
           the need for an accurate, consistent, universal cancer outcome
           prediction system. Since the TNM staging system was introduced in
           the 1950s, new prognostic factors have been identified and new
           methods for integrating prognostic factors have been developed.
           This study compares the prediction accuracy of the TNM staging
           system with that of artificial neural network statistical models.
           METHODS: For 5-year survival of patients with breast or colorectal
           carcinoma, the authors compared the TNM staging system's predictive
           accuracy with that of artificial neural networks (ANN). The area
           under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as applied to an
           independent validation data set, was the measure of accuracy.
           RESULTS: For the American College of Surgeons' Patient Care
           Evaluation (PCE) data set, using only the TNM variables (tumor
           size, number of positive regional lymph nodes, and distant
           metastasis), the artificial neural network's predictions of the
           5-year survival of patients with breast carcinoma were
           significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system
           (TNM, 0.720; ANN, 0.770; P < 0.001). For the National Cancer
           Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results breast
           carcinoma data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial
           neural network's predictions of 10-year survival were significantly
           more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.692;
           ANN, 0.730; P < 0.01). For the PCE colorectal data set, using only
           the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of
           the 5-year survival of patients with colorectal carcinoma were
           significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system
           (TNM, 0.737; ANN, 0.815; P < 0.001). Adding commonly collected
           demographic and anatomic variables to the TNM variables further
           increased the accuracy of the artificial neural network's
           predictions of breast carcinoma survival (0.784) and colorectal
           carcinoma survival (0.869). CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks
           are significantly more accurate than the TNM staging system when
           both use the TNM prognostic factors alone. New prognostic factors
           can be added to artificial neural networks to increase prognostic
           accuracy further. These results are robust across different data
           sets and cancer sites.}

           privately (Breiman (1992) calls it a `quiet scandal'), they (we)
           continue to ignore the difficulties because it is not clear what
           else could or should be done. P. 421: Estimation errors for
           regression coefficients are usually smaller than errors from
           failing to take into account model specification. P. 422:
           Statisticians must stop pretending that model uncertainty does not
           exist and begin to find ways of coping with it. P. 426: It is
           indeed strange that we often admit model uncertainty by searching
           for a best model but then ignore this uncertainty by making
           inferences and predictions as if certain that the best fitting
           model is actually true. P. 427: The analyst needs to assess the
           model selection {\em process} and not just the best fitting model.
           P. 432: The use of subset selection methods is well known to
           introduce alarming biases. P. 433: ... the AIC can be highly biased
           in data-driven model selection situations. P. 434: Prediction
           intervals will generally be too narrow. In the discussion, Jamal R.

           regarded in some circles as bad statistics. It would, however, be
           widely regarded as good science. I do not believe that anything
           that is good science can be bad statistics, and conclude my remarks
           with the hope that there are no statisticians so inflexible as to
           decline to analyze an honest body of scientific data simply because
           it fails to conform to some favored theoretical scheme. If there

           reflects the risks or benefits for that patient. Gail has noted
           this previously [ENAR Presidential Invited Address, April 1990],
           arguing that one goal of a clinical trial ought to be to predict
           the direction and size of a treatment benefit for a patient with
           specific covariate values. In contrast, population-averaged
           estimates of treatment effect compare outcomes in groups of
           patients. The groups being compared are determined by whatever
           covariates are included in the model. The treatment effect is then
           a comparison of average outcomes, where the averaging is over all
           omitted covariates.''}

           empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws
           that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making
           adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will
           lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under
           evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on
           nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to
           explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize
           themselves by missing possibly important findings.''}

come to believe certain pieces of information, including how
rumors are spread and why so many people believe in UFOs and ESP.
The book also deals quite a bit with why people believe in ineffective
remedies for illness, and why people are impressed with coincidences.
A theme that runs through the book is that people are good with
numerators but not with denominators.  The book has widespread
applicability to how we interpret information and will make every
reader a better decision maker. }

  annote =		 {double data entry;clinical trials;data
  management;Study demonstrated performing double vs. single data 
  entry in a centralized data entry environment decreased error rates
  from 0.15% to 0.13%.  When errors were further classified based on
  their study impact, the single entry error rate was 0.04%.  The
  authors concluded the calculated difference was insignificant based
  on their work practices, and acknowledged the success or failure of
  single data entry required skilled staff and comprehensive computer
  data edit checking systems.  Abstract: There is some controversy
  over the need for double data entry in clinical trials. In
  particular, does the number and types of errors identified with this
  approach justify the extra effort involved? We report the results of
  a study carried out to address this question. Our main outcome
  measure was the frequency and types of errors involved in the entry
  of data for the CHART (continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated
  radiotherapy) trials. Data were reentered for a sample of 44
  patients by a data manager other than the one making the initial
  entry. The second entry was then compared with the first entry. The
  error rate for the two entries combined was 14 per 10,000 data items
  (fields) (95% confidence interval 10, 19). The error rate for the
  initial entry alone was 15 per 10,000 fields (95% confidence
  interval 9.5, 22), and the vital/important error rate (defined as
  any error on a principal outcome measure or a major error on any
  other endpoint or variable) was 2.5 per 10,000 fields (95%
  confidence interval 0.68, 6.4). On this evidence double data entry
  is not performed for the CHART trials.}

You state on the top of P. 1902 that ``Since the QT shortens as the heart rate increases and the heart rate, when modified pharmacologically, is not a constant, a correction factor is needed to assess the QT intervals.''  This does not seem to follow logically although it has certainly been the tradition.  If a drug changes heart rate and this is prognostic of bad outcomes for the patient, and if correcting for the change in heart rate removes a bad prognostic effect of QT changes, can it not be a mistake to correct for heart rate changes?

A good deal of the paper rests on the between-patient variance being greater than zero.  The confidence interval for d11 is [.0018,.0190] which goes fairly close to zero.  Isn't there a boundary problem at zero with MLE or REML estimates of variances?  Has the confidence coverage of such confidence intervals (both tails being 0.025) been verified by simulation?

Your model in section 4.2 is on the QT scale but your other models were on the log QT scale.  How do you know which scale is appropriate for section 4.2?

You have a lot of heart cycles per subject available for analysis.  I am unclear how many were used per subject when fitting equation (3).  It would make sense to use hundreds of cycles per subject when modeling within-patient heart rate dependency on QT intervals.

prognostic relevance of the S-phase fraction in breast cancer published
in the literature.  They identified 19 different cutpoints used in the
literature; some of them were solely used because they emerged as the
`optimal' cutpoint in a specific data set. In a meta-analysis on the
relationship between cathepsin-D content and disease-free survival in
node-negative breast cancer patients, 12 studies were in included with
12 different cutpoints ... Interestingly, neither cathepsin-D nor the

perimeter is lined with an array of numbers, and after the wheel is
given a spin, the needle lands on 65.  You are confronted with a
question: Is the percentage of African countries in the United Nations
greater or less than 65?  Not a matter you have thought much about,
but nonetheless, you are fairly sure that the percentage is less than
65.  What, you are asked, is the \emph{exact} percentage of African
countries in the United Nations?  After some thought, you respond with
an estimate of 45 percent.  A research records your response, thanks
you for your time, and off you go.  Now you are another person, a
person who has not yet answered questions about the United Nations, a
person for whom the wheel of fortune will land on 10 rather than 65.
After the wheel has stopped moving, the researcher asks: Is the
percentage of African countries in the United Nations great or less
than 10?  More you say -- certainly it must be more.  What is the
\emph{exact} percentage of African countries in the United Nations?
After some thought, you respond with an estimate of 25 percent.  In
fact, just a procedure, yielding identical results, was conducted by
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974).  Subjects who were randomly
assigned to an experimental condition in which the needle landed on 65
subsequently gave a median estimate of 45 percent, and subjects for
whom the needle landed on 10 gave a median estimate of 25 percent.
Tversky and Kahneman explained this phenomenon in terms of 'anchoring
and adjustment' -- that is, the insufficient adjustment up or down
from an original starting value, or 'anchor'.  ... Surprisingly, the
effects of anchoring do not disappear with monetary incentives for
accuracy (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974; Wright and Anderson, 1989) or
with outrageously extreme anchors (Quattrone et al., 1984).  In one
experiment, Quattrone and his associates (1984) solicited exact
numerical estimates after first asking whether the number of Beatles
records that had made the top 10 fell above or below 100,025 albums,
whether the average price of a college textbook was more or less than
\$7128.53, or whether the average temperature in San Francisco was
greater or less than 558$^{\deg}$.  Quattrone's research team found that
absurdly high anchor values worked just as well as more plausible
anchor values.  From this result, they concluded that anchoring is a
robust phenomenon in which the size of the effect grows with the
discrepancy between the anchor and the 'preanchor estimate' ... until
the effect reaches an asymptotic level.  If true, these findings
suggest that negotiators, advertisers, politicians, and other
persuasion specialists will generally be most succesful by staking out
extreme initial positions.''}

stratification via estimated propensity scores based on within-stratum
sample mean differences and a fixed number of strata can lead to biased
inference due to residual confounding, and the effect of this bias
becomes more serious with increasing sample size. Using more strata
can increase the sample size at which the trade-off of bias and
variability involved in efficiency takes place, but stratifying on
quintiles seems to be the most popular approach in practice, even for
substantial sample sizes. Thus, as the trade-off point will be unknown
for any specific problem, this approach should be used with caution. An
interesting avenue for future research would be to establish
guidelines for choosing the number of strata based on theoretical
analysis of the rate at which the number of strata should increase
with sample size to eliminate bias. A modification of stratification
based instead on within-stratum regression estimates of treatment effect
can eliminate this bias and achieve dramatic improvements in efficiency,
but correct specification of the regression model is essential;
otherwise, bias and degradation of performance can result. In this
regard, this approach is similar to estimating causal effects via
direct regression modelling but is less sensitive to
mismodelling. Methods based on weighting are consistent and offer
approximately unbiased inference for practical sample sizes. The
semiparametric efficient estimator identified by the theory of Robins et
al. [13], which incorporates regression modelling as a way to gain efficiency,
also yields high precision. Although stratification based on
regression and direct modelling can outperform this approach under
some conditions, this estimator enjoys the unique 'double robustness'
property in that it continues to lead to unbiased estimation of the
average causal effect even if the regression models involved do not
coincide with the true relationship, affording the analyst broad
protection against misspecification not available with these other
approaches. The results presented here support routine use of this
estimator in practice.''; nice derivations of inner workings of propensity score

the value of randomization if, in all except the Normal case, we
cannot guarantee to have unbiased estimates.  My view ... was that the
form of analysis envisaged (that is to say, which factors and
covariates should be fitted) justified the allocation and \emph{not

We don't know what asymptotic means for a given dataset, and it ignores the poor power that parametric tests have when extreme skewness or kurtosis is present.  Many students are confused by the central limit theorem, thinking it applies to both type I and II errors when it only applies to type I.  There is another hazard to multi-step approaches, related to not preserving type I error.  Companies may sometimes ``forget'' about their intention to test for normality, for example, if the t-test is significant.}

cross-validations, focusing primarily on the results of the incomplete
cross-validation (for the same genes each time), but the error rate
was higher ... in the complete cross-validation.  Three other groups
... also selected among several gene models the ones with best
performance in cross-validation. ... However the best performance was
seen in four small datasets ... the odds of reaching a formally
significant association increased 3.5 times ... per doubling of sample
size and 9.7 times ... per ten-fold increase in the number of
probes. ... A study on lung adenocarcinoma found that unsupervised DNA
microarray analysis predicted death with a sensitivity of 38\% and a
specificity of 81\%.  Cross-validation of supervised modelling gave
71\% sensitivity and 66\% specificity.  In two independent
validations, the sensitivity was 64\% and 50\%, with specificity 63\%

correlates.  The predictive performance of this new technique was
variable, and in many cases molecular classifications were not
subjected to appropriate validation.  Validation in independent
datasets has been rare.  Furthermore, without full adjustment for
previously known predictors of cancer outcomes, appraisal of the
contribution of DNA microarray data towards individualising cancer
management is difficult. ... incomplete cross-validation can lead to
inflated estimates of accuracy. ... Reporting of only the best results
spuriously inflates accuracy. ... Phase III studies have been rare in

                  inflexibility, which in turn limits innovation in
                  the design and analysis of clinical trials. ... The
                  set of `other possible results' depends on the
                  experimental design. ... Everything that is known is
                  taken as given and all probabilities are calculated
                  conditionally on known values. ... in contrast to
                  the frequentist approach, only the probabilities of
                  the observed results matter. ... The continuous
                  learning that is possible in the Bayesian approach
                  enables investigators to modify trials in midcourse.
                  ... it is possible to learn from small samples,

                  adapt to what is learned to enable better treatment
                  of patients. ... subjectivity in prior distributions
                  is explicit and open to examination (and critique)
                  by all.  ... The Bayesian approach has several
                  advantages in drug development.  One is the process
                  of updating knowledge gradually rather than
                  restricting revisions in study design to large,

	Abstract = {Concentrations of chemical constituents of precipitation  
are frequently expressed in terms of the precipitation-weighted mean,  
which has several desirable properties. Unfortunately, the weighted  
mean has no analytical analog of the standard error of the arithmetic  
mean for use in characterizing its statistical uncertainty. Several  
approximate expressions have been used previously in the literature,  
but there is no consensus as to which is best. This paper compares  
three methods from the literature with a standard based on  
bootstrapping. Comparative calculations were carried out for nine  
major ions measured at 222 sampling sites in the National Atmospheric  
Deposition/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). The ratio variance  
approximation of Cochran (1977) gave results that were not  
statistically different from those of bootstrapping, and is suggested  
as the method of choice for routine computing of the standard error  
of the weighted mean. The bootstrap method has advantages of its own,  
including the fact that it is nonparametric, but requires additional  
effort and computation time.}}

	Abstract = {One motivation for estimating the standard error, SEMw,  
of a weighted mean concentration, Mw, of an ion in precipitation is  
to use it to compute a confidence interval for Mw. Typically this is  
done by multiplying the standard error by a factor that depends on  
the degree of confidence one wishes to express, on the assumption  
that the weighted mean has a normal distribution. This paper compares  
confidence intervals of Mw concentrations of ions in precipitation,  
as computed using the assumption of a normal distribution, with those  
estimated from distributions produced by bootstrapping. The  
hypothesis that Mw was normally distributed was rejected about half  
the time (at the 5{\%} significance level) in tests involving nine  
major ions measured at ten diverse sites in the National Atmospheric  
Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). Most of these  
rejections occurred at sites with fewer than 100 samples, in  
agreement with previous results. Nevertheless, the hypothesis was  
often rejected at sites with more than 100 samples as well. The  
maximum error (relative to Mw) in the 95{\%} confidence limits made  
by assuming a normal distribution of the Mw at the ten sites examined  
was about 27{\%}. Most such errors were less than 10{\%}, and errors  
were smaller at sampling sites with > 100 samples than at those with  
< 100 samples.}}

Most of the 866 patients enrolled in our multicenter study underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring and determination of the resting radionuclide ventricular ejection fraction before discharge. Univariate analyses showed a progressive increase in cardiac mortality during one year as the ejection fraction fell below 0.40 and as the number of ventricular ectopic depolarizations exceeded one per hour. Only four risk factors among eight prespecified variables were independent predictors of mortality: an ejection fraction below 0.40, ventricular ectopy of 10 or more depolarizations per hour, advanced New York Heart Association functional class before infarction, and rales heard in the upper two thirds of the lung fields while the patient was in the coronary-care unit. Various combinations of these four factors identified five risk subgroups with two-year mortality rates ranging from 3 per cent (no factors) to 60 per cent (all four factors).

In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.}

The receiver of a diagnostic measurement \ldots wants to make a decision based on some $x_{c}$, and is not especially interested in how well he would have done had he used some different cutoff.''; in the discussion David Hand states ``when integrating to yield the overall AUC measure, it is necessary to decide what weight to give each value in the integration.

A three-decision rule, credited to Neyman or Wald, is presented that does not require the doubling of the $p$-value, and is consistent with a Bayesian approach.  For most comparative clinical trials the three-decision rule is appropriate, and its use would abolish the controversy over one-sided tests.''}

To get around copyright protection, Ronald Fisher restructered the tables to present critical values for $t$ for $\alpha=.01, .02, .05, .1, .2, .3, ... .9$.  This has led to the use of cutoffs for $P$-values to determine what Fisher called ``significance'', which has led to widespread problems in science and especially to publication bias.

  Abstract = {The use of the Gibbs sampler with fully conditionally specified models, where the distribution of each variable given the other variables is the starting point, has become a popular method to create imputations in incomplete multivariate data. The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.}

Circularity is therefore the error that beautifies results, rendering them more attractive to authors, reviewers and editors, and thus more competitive for publication.

We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.

An initiative to advance our knowledge about the effectiveness of clinical strategies can hasten the day when personalized medicine transforms health care.\ldots large observational databases and pooled trial results can be used to learn more about the subgroups of patients who benefit from therapy. A recent study showed that mortality was similar overall for patients with coronary disease whether treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass surgery. However, the results varied strikingly with age: mortality was much lower with surgery among patients 65 years of age or older and lower with PCI among those 55 years of age or younger. Such information is important not only for patients with varying risk characteristics and coexisting conditions but for women, members of minority groups, and others who have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials. Current CER efforts aim to ensure that much more useful data will be collected and that better methods will be developed for understanding differences in effectiveness among different patient groups. \ldots The greatest obstacle to the adoption of personalized approaches such as genomic testing, however, is the lack of adequately designed studies assessing their clinical utility. Often there is little consensus about the best way to design and implement such studies. We may know very little about how a test might improve health in typical clinical settings. These are precisely the kinds of issues that CER is designed to address. \ldots Genomic medicine, however, has had little impact to date in most areas of care -- a fact that some critics blame on payers, claiming that they impose unrealistically high evidence barriers before agreeing to pay for genomic tests. But payers have often championed personalized approaches -- for example, by reimbursing for KRAS testing before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fully embraced it. The real bottleneck is often the science itself: progress in identifying clinically important genetic variants has been slow, since seldom does the presence of a common variant greatly increase the relative risk of a serious disease or of severe harm from treatment. Moreover, only some genomic tests provide clinically important information. For example, although the FDA endorsed the use of genomic tests to identify persons with warfarin sensitivity, comparative trials showed that the tests added little value over careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio. Chromosomal mutation 9p21.3 is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women, but a recent study showed that knowledge of its presence adds no additional predictive power to the standard information on risk.

Health care, because of its desire to be `scientific,' has not only been stricken by the curse of Kelvin, but has positively embraced it; this despite the fact that many prominent scientists (including some of Kelvin's contemporaries, eg, Darwin or Virchow) succeeded while completely ignoring his advice. Thus, we see a proliferation of scales and measurement instruments aimed at quantifying the hitherto unquantifiable''.  A.R.

The stated goal of this operation is to provide unitless covariates to compare like with like, especially when penalized likelihood or prior distributions are used. We contend that this vision is too simplistic. Instead, we propose to take into account a more essential component of the structure of the regression matrix by rescaling the covariates based on the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of the maximum-likelihood estimator. We illustrate the differences between the standard $\rho$ and proposed $\Sigma$-rescalings with various estimators and data sets.}

  volume = 	 37,

  pages = 	 {83-117},
  annote = 	 {multiple imputation;missing data;missing Y;  Abstract:When fitting a generalized linear model--such as linear regression, logistic regression, or
hierarchical linear modeling--analysts often wonder how to handle missing values of the
dependent variable Y. If missing values have been filled in using multiple imputation, the
usual advice is to use the imputed Y values in analysis. We show, however, that using
imputed Ys can add needless noise to the estimates. Better estimates can usually be obtained
using a modified strategy that we call multiple imputation, then deletion (MID). Under MID,
all cases are used for imputation, but following imputation cases with imputed Y values are
excluded from the analysis. When there is something wrong with the imputed Y values, MID
protects the estimates from the problematic imputations. And when the imputed Y values are
acceptable, MID usually offers somewhat more efficient estimates than an ordinary MI
strategy.  From Peter Lachenbruch: Going back to Bruce Weaver's comment, I've finished reading van Hippel's paper and the argument is
1.      Use all variables to impute all others - this will include the y variable - i.e. a y that is present carries information on the missing x values.
2.      After the imputation step, remove all cases in which the y value is missing.  The reason for this is that these cases carry no information about the regression of y on the x values.  The math for this is outlined in van Hippel's paper.  The y values do carry information about the x values (whether missing or not) and so can be used for the imputation.  Once imputation is complete, the imputed y values carry no information for the regression - and add nothing further.  Thus, by deleting these observations, we obtain a slightly better prediction.  In his paper, the simulations are based on normal distributions, and the improvement is small.  Nothing was said about imputation and prediction for non-normal (e.g., binary or poisson) cases.  Still an open question.
3.      For the query posted by Irene Zeng: Missing at baseline is always a pain in the neck, but if you have plenty of other times, you can impute the baseline and then use your Kaplan-Meier estimate (or a proportional hazards model).  Using means is almost always a bad idea,  and even worse is last observation carried forward (or first observation carried backward). }

The short-term consultant model relegates the statistician to a subsidiary position, and suggests that applied statistics consists of handling well-formulated questions, so as to match an accepted method to nearly any kind of data. \dots Statistical thinking uses probabilistic descriptions of variability in (1) inductive reasoning and (2) analysis of procedures for data collection, prediction, and scientific inference. \dots The essential component that characterizes the discipline is the introduction of probability to describe variation in order to provide a good solution to a problem involving the reduction of data for a specific purpose. \dots (we) elaborate our definition of statistical thinking by stating that it involves two principles: 1. Statistical models of regularity and variability in data may be used to express knowledge and uncertainty about a signal in the presence of noise, via inductive reasoning.  2. Statistical methods may be analyzed to determine how well they are likely to perform.''}
