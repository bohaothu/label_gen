                 This paper shows how the semantic-grammar acquisition
                 problem can be viewed as the learning of search-control
                 heuristics in a logic program. Appropriate control
                 rules are learned using a new first-order induction
                 algorithm that automatically invents useful syntactic
                 and semantic categories. Empirical results show that

                 and out-perform previous approaches based on
