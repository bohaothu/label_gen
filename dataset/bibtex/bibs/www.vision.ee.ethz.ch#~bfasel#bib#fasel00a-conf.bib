  abstract = "Most automatic facial expression analysis systems try to analyze
 emotion categories. However, psychologists argue that there is no straight
forward way to classify emotions from facial expressions. Instead, they
propose FACS (Facial Action Coding System), a de-facto standard for 
categorizing facial actions independent from emotional categories. We 
describe a system that recognizes asymmetric FACS Action Unit activities and 
intensities without the use of markers. Facial expression extraction is
achieved by difference images that are projected into a sub-space using 
either PCA or ICA, followed by nearest neighbor classification. Experiments 
show that this holistic approach achieves a recognition performance 
comparable to marker-based facial expression analysis systems or human FACS 
experts for a single-subject database recorded under controlled conditions.",
