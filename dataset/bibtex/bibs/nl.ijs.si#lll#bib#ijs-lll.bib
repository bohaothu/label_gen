  Automatic lemmatisation is a core application for many language
  processing tasks. In inflectionally rich languages, such as Slovene,
  assigning the correct lemma (base form) to each word in a running
  text is not trivial, as, for instance, nouns inflect for number and
  case, with a complex configuration of endings and stem
  modifications. The problem is especially difficult for unknown
  words, as word-forms cannot be matched against a morphological
  lexicon. The paper discusses a machine learning approach to the
  automatic lemmatisation of unknown words in Slovene texts. We
  decompose the problem of learning to perform lemmatisation into two
  subproblems: learning to perform morphosyntactic tagging of words in
  a text, and learning to perform morphological analysis, which
  produces the lemma from the word-form given the correct
  morphosyntactic tag. A statistics-based trigram tagger is used to
  learn morphosyntactic tagging and a first-order decision list
  learning system is used to learn rules for morphological
  analysis. We train the analyser on open-class inflecting Slovene
  words, namely nouns, adjectives, and main verbs, together being
  characterised by more than 400 different morphosyntactic tags. Our
  training sets consist of a morphological lexicon containing 15,000
  lemmas and a manually annotated corpus consisting of 100,000 running
  words.  We evaluate the learned model on word lists extracted from a
  corpus of Slovene texts containing 500,000 words, and show that our
  morphological analysis module achieves 98.6\% accuracy, while the
  combination of the tagger and analyser is 92.0\% accurate on unknown
  inflecting Slovene words.

  abstract = {We consider the task of tagging Slovene words with morphosyntactic
  descriptions (MSDs). MSDs contain not only part-of-speech
  information but also attributes such as gender and case. In the case
  of Slovene there are 2,083 possible MSDs. P-Progol was used to learn
  morphosyntactic disambiguation rules from annotated data (consisting
  of 161,314 examples) produced by the MULTEXT-East project.  P-Progol
  produced 1,148 rules taking 36 hours.  Using simple grammatical
  background knowledge, e.g.\ looking for case disagreement, P-Progol
  induced 4,094 clauses in eight parallel runs.  These rules have
  proved effective at detecting and explaining incorrect MSD
  annotations in an independent test set, but have not so far produced
  a tagger comparable to other existing taggers in terms of accuracy.}
