software managers can employ to dramatically improve their software

code and library technology.  We have learned that careful consideration
must be given to people, process, and technology.  One approach to the 
systematic integration of these three elements is the concept of the 
software factory.  At Hewlett-Packard Co, we have initiated a multi-
faceted corporate reuse program to help introduce the best practices of 
systematic reuse into the company, complemented by multidisciplinary 
research to investigate and develop better methods for domain-specific,
reuse-based software engineering.  This essay discusses our experiences.
Key aspects include domain-specific kits, business modeling, organization
design, and technology infrastructure for a flexible software factory.}

Object technology (OT) is believed to be crucial to achieving the long-sought
after goal of widespread reuse. Unfortunately, many people naively equate
reuse with objects, adopting it to ``automatically'' ensure reuse, but often
do not get much reuse.  There are also many examples of successful reuse using
non-OO languages. Thus objects are neither necessary nor sufficient for
effective reuse.  Without an explicit reuse agenda, OO reuse will not succeed.
In almost all cases of successful reuse, non-technical issues such as
management support and a stable domain seem to dominate over specific language
or design methodology.  True systematic OO reuse in today's OT requires
several improvements, including: reuse-oriented processes; extended OO methods
to directly support domain, component, and framework engineering; better
understanding of the production of layered, modular architectures; and methods
for augmenting OO application frameworks with problem-oriented, scripting
languages.

The panelists will explore software reuse from several perspectives, covering
process, organizations, methods, languages, architecture, tools, patterns, and
frameworks, discussing the benefits and problems raised using OT for effective
reuse.  They bring a wealth of insight, gained from many years of research,
teaching and practical experience in developing OO applications, tools,
methods and reuse.  They have built several large applications and frameworks
in SmallTalk, C++, Visual Basic and other non-OO languages. They have
contributed to the use of systematic reuse in several companies, and are
engaged in developing new reuse enabling methods and processes.

  ,abstract = {The domain analysis methodology being developed at the SEI is
to support reuse at the functional and architectural levels.  We believe that
the commonality identified at these levels can be used to support library
management and reusable components construction, as well as reuse at
functional and architectural levels.  We view domain analysis as a phase in
the software lifecycle where a domain model, which describes the common
functions, data, and relationships of a family of systems in the domain, a
dictionary, which defines the terminology used in the domain, and a set of
software architectures, which describe the packaging, control, and
interfaces, are produced.  The information necessary to produce a domain
model, a dictionary, and an architecture is gathered, organized, and
represented during the domain analysis.}

  ,abstract = {In this article, I relate the experience I
and my clients have gained in developing tightly
constrained, custom systems, in which success depends on
delivering a functional system on time and on budget, often
for a fixed price.  Many of the systems we developed had the
additional constraint of real-time requirements, and most
had some kind of reuse goals.
We have learned how to adapt existing management skills and
techniques to object-oriented development.  We have also
lerned how component reuse can be brought under the control
of project management; our lessons and suggestions about
achieving reuse are summarized in the box on p.46-47.}
