data model provides a set of base types consisting of integers and
reals of varying sizes, character strings, booleans and enumerations.
The type constructors of EXTRA include tuples, fixed and variable
length arrays, sets and references. References are used for complex
object support. In addition to this, EXTRA also supports derived
attributes through function definitions and new base types are formed
through user defined ADT's. EXTRA completely separates the notions of
type and instance. Collections of instances must be explicitly created

developed by the {Alta\"{i}r} Group located in France. O$_2$ is based on
the set-and-tuple data model. It extends the basic model by dealing
with arbitrary complex objects and defining a strong type system with
overriding. They have borrowed Cardelli's \cite{cardelli84}
interpretation of inheritance for tuple types over that of Bruce and
Wegner's \cite{bruce86} because of its intuitive notion of subtyping
for tuple structures. Values in O$_2$ can be atomic, set-structured or
tuple-structured. Objects support strong identity and are initially
defined as (identity, value) pairs, but later revised into the triple
(identity, value, methods) similar to that of Straube's
\cite{straube91b}. O$_2$ defines the three equality relationships of
identity equal, shallow equal and deep equal. Type structures have
interpretations which identifies their subtyping and classification
relationships. The entire definition is formal and concise for the power and expressibility it provides.",
