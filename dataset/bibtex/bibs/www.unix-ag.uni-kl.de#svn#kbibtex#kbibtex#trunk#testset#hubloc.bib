No access, it shows that p-Median is NP-hard, but O(n^2p^2) if the network is a tree:
It is shown that the problem of finding a $p$-median of a network is an
$NP$-hard problem even when the network has a simple structure (e.g., planar
graph of maximum vertex degree 3). However, results leading to efficient
algorithms are presented when the network is a tree: In particular, we first
show that a 1-median of a tree is identical to its $w$-centroid, and obtain
Goldman's $O(n)$ algorithm for finding a 1-median of a tree out of more
general considerations. Then, we present an algorithm which finds a $p$-median
of a tree (for $p > 1$) in time $O(n^2 \cdot p^2 )$.
