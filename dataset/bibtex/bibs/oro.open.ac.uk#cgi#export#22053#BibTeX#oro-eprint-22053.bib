        abstract = {Most of the research in multimedia retrieval applications has focused on retrieval by content or retrieval by example. Since the classical review by Smeulders, Worring, Santini, Gupta, and Jain (2000) a new interest has grown immensely in the multimedia information retrieval community: retrieval by semantics. This exciting new research area arises as a combination of multimedia understanding, information extraction, information retrieval and digital libraries. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of analysis algorithms to extract semantic information from multimedia content. We discuss statistical approaches to analyse images and video content and conclude with a discussion regarding the described methods.}
