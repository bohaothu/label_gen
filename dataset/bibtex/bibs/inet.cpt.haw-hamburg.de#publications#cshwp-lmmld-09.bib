 omnipresent at our students, advertising itself as the platform for mobile, pervasive learning. Currently, these devices rapidly open and enhance, being soon able to serve as a major platform for rich, open multimedia applications and communication. In this report we introduce a video conferencing software, which seamlessly integrates mobile with stationary users into fully distributed multi-party conversations. Following the paradigm of flexible, user-initiated group communication, we present an integrated solution, which scales well for medium-size conferences and accounts for the heterogeneous nature of mobile and stationary participants. This approach allows for a spontaneous, location independent establishment of video dialogs, which is of particular importance in interactive learning scenarios. The work is based on a highly optimized realization of a H.264 codec.},
