% The user is kindly requested to send corrections and/or additions
% to this current bibliography to the forementioned address. This
% concerns especially to talks based on an existing, but not
% listed technical report.
%
% First of all, the author is deeply indebted to Irv Lustig, Princeton. His
% salient encouragement and cooperation have influenced the development and
% publication of this bibliography.
% Based on Lustig's idea "to indicate that something is a talk" (because,
% sometimes, a talk and the corresponding report differs only in title) the
% author has rewritten his Discussion Paper published at the FernUniversitaet
% Hagen, May 1991.
%
% At last, the author is obliged to Eric Grosse and Dave Gay for making this
% bibliography available via NETLIB.
