ABSTRACT::
Chinese characters are used daily by well over a billion people. They constitute
the main writing system of China and Taiwan, form a major part of written Japanese,
and are also used in South Korea. Anything more than a cursory glance at these characters
will reveal a high degree of structure to them, but computing systems do not currently
have a means to operate on this structure. Existing character databases and dictionaries
treat them as numerical code points, and associate with them additional `hand-computed'
data, such as stroke count, stroke order, and other information to aid in specific
searches. Searching by a character's `shape' is effectively impossible in these
systems.

I propose a new approach to representing these characters, through an XML-based
language called SCML. This language, by encoding an abstract form of a character,
allows the direct retrieval of important information such as stroke count and stroke
order, and permits useful but previously impossible automated analysis of characters.
In addition, the system allows the design of a view that takes abstract SCML representations
as character models and outputs glyphs based on an aesthetic, facilitating the creation
of `meta-fonts' for Chinese characters. Finally, through the creation of a specialized
database, SCML allows for efficient structural character queries to be performed
against the body of inserted characters, thus allowing people to search by the most
obvious of a character's characteristics: its shape.
