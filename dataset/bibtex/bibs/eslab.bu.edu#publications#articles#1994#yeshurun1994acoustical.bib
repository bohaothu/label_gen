  abstract =     { The left-right signal correspondence problem, that
                  is considered as one of the most prominent problems
                  by visual stereoscopic computational models, is much
                  ignored by computational auditory stereophonic
                  models. The correspondence problem, which is trivial
                  if only one acoustic source is present, is highly
                  complicated for a multiple sources environment. The
                  authors present a computational model able to
                  perform localization of natural complex acoustic
                  signals (one or two human speakers). The model
                  relies mainly on computing the cross-correlation
                  functions of selected frequency channels arriving at
                  the two ears, and performing a weighted integration
                  on these functions. Thus, first attempts are made to
                  establish a correspondence between acoustic features
                  of the two channels. Preliminary results show that
                  this model, which might be compared to "early
                  vision" models in computational vision research, can
                  serve as a first step in analyzing the acoustic
                  scene},
