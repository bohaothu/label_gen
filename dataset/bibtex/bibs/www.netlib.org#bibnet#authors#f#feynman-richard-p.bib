                 increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved
                 in the calculation of these curves. The force on a
                 nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the
                 classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on
                 this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons'

                 in a different way. It is, however, mathematically
                 equivalent to the familiar formulation. In quantum
                 mechanics the probability of an event which can happen
                 in several different ways is the absolute square of a
                 sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative
                 way. The probability that a particle will be found to
                 have a path $x(t)$ lying somewhere within a region of
                 space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one
                 from each path in the region. The contribution from a
                 single path is postulated to be an exponential whose
                 (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of
                 $\hbar$) for the path in question. The total
                 contribution from all paths reaching $x$, $t$ from the
                 past is the wave function $\psi (x, t)$. This is shown
                 to satisfy Schr{\"o}dinger's equation. The relation to

  abstract =     "In this paper two things are done. (1) It is shown
                 that a considerable simplification can be attained in
                 writing down matrix elements for complex processes in
                 electrodynamics. Further, a physical point of view is
                 available which permits them to be written down
                 directly for any specific problem. Being simply a
                 restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however,
                 the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2)
                 Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction
                 of electrons at short distances. All matrix elements
                 are now finite, with the exception of those relating to
                 problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are
                 evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe,
                 which gives finite results for these matrices also. The
                 only effects sensitive to the modification are changes
                 in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could
                 not be directly observed. Phenomena directly
                 observable, are insensitive to the details of the
                 modification used (except at extreme energies). For
                 such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of
                 the modification goes to zero. The results then agree
                 with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and
                 presumably consistent, method is therefore available
                 for the calculation of all processes involving
                 electrons and photons.\par

                 The simplification in writing the expressions results
                 from an emphasis on the over-all space-time view
                 resulting from a study of the solution of the equations
                 of electrodynamics. The relation of this to the more
                 conventional Hamiltonian point of view is discussed. It
                 would be very difficult to make the modification which
                 is proposed if one insisted on having the equations in
                 Hamiltonian form.

                 The methods apply as well to charges obeying the
                 Klein--Gordon equation, and to the various meson
                 theories of nuclear forces. Illustrative examples are
                 given. Although a modification like that used in
                 electrodynamics can make all matrices finite for all of
                 the meson theories, for some of the theories it is no
                 longer true that all directly observable phenomena are
                 insensitive to the details of the modification
                 used.

                 The actual evaluation of integrals appearing in the
                 matrix elements may be facilitated, in the simpler
                 cases, by methods described in the appendix.",

  abstract =     "The problem of the behavior of positrons and electrons
                 in given external potentials, neglecting their mutual
                 interaction, is analyzed by replacing the theory of
                 holes by a reinterpretation of the solutions of the
                 Dirac equation. It is possible to write down a complete
                 solution of the problem in terms of boundary conditions
                 on the wave function, and this solution contains
                 automatically all the possibilities of virtual (and
                 real) pair formation and annihilation together with the
                 ordinary scattering processes, including the correct
                 relative signs of the various terms.\par

                 In this solution, the ``negative energy states'' appear
                 in a form which may be pictured (as by St{\"u}ckelberg)
                 in space-time as waves traveling away from the external
                 potential backwards in time. Experimentally, such a
                 wave corresponds to a positron approaching the
                 potential and annihilating the electron. A particle
                 moving forward in time (electron) in a potential may be
                 scattered forward in time (ordinary scattering) or
                 backward (pair annihilation). When moving backward
                 (positron) it may be scattered backward in time
                 (positron scattering) or forward (pair production). For
                 such a particle the amplitude for transition from an
                 initial to a final state is analyzed to any order in
                 the potential by considering it to undergo a sequence
                 of such scatterings.\par

                 The amplitude for a process involving many such
                 particles is the product of the transition amplitudes
                 for each particle. The exclusion principle requires
                 that antisymmetric combinations of amplitudes be chosen
                 for those complete processes which differ only by
                 exchange of particles. It seems that a consistent
                 interpretation is only possible if the exclusion
                 principle is adopted. The exclusion principle need not
                 be taken into account in intermediate states. Vacuum
                 problems do not arise for charges which do not interact
                 with one another, but these are analyzed nevertheless
                 in anticipation of application to quantum
                 electrodynamics.\par

                 The results are also expressed in momentum--energy
                 variables. Equivalence to the second quantization
                 theory of holes is proved in an appendix.",

                 the solution of problems in quantum electrodynamics is
                 established. Starting with Fermi's formulation of the
                 field as a set of harmonic oscillators, the effect of
                 the oscillators is integrated out in the Lagrangian
                 form of quantum mechanics. There results an expression
                 for the effect of all virtual photons valid to all
                 orders in e2/ c. It is shown that evaluation of this
                 expression as a power series in e2/ c gives just the
                 terms expected by the aforementioned rules.\par

                 In addition, a relation is established between the
                 amplitude for a given process in an arbitrary
                 unquantized potential and in a quantum electrodynamical
                 field. This relation permits a simple general statement

                 suggested. Instead of the order being defined by the
                 position on the paper, an ordering subscript is
                 introduced so that $A_s B_s$ means $AB$ or $BA$
                 depending on whether $s$ exceeds $s$ or vice
                 versa. Then $A_s$ can be handled as though it were an
                 ordinary numerical function of $s$. An increase in ease

                 quantum mechanics are made. In quantum electrodynamics

                 ordering parameter in this case as a fifth coordinate

  abstract =     "The relativistic corrections to the Lamb shift, i.e.,
                 terms of order $\alpha (Z \alpha)^5 mc^2$, are
                 calculated. For this purpose, the Lamb shift is
                 separated into one term in which the Coulomb potential
                 acts only once, and another term in which it acts two
                 or more times (Sec. II). The one-potential term is
                 shown to be equal to the expression calculated in
                 previous papers except for corrections of order $\alpha
                 (Z \alpha)^6$ (Sec. III), and a method is given by
                 which these corrections could be evaluated if desired
                 (Appendix). The many-potential term can be separated
                 into a nonrelativistic part which is again equal to the
                 term calculated in previous papers, and a relativistic
                 term which can be calculated by considering the
                 intermediate states as free (Sec. IV). The calculation
                 of the latter term which, of course, involves the
                 Coulomb potential exactly twice, is described in Sec.
                 V. A correction to the vacuum polarization term which
                 is of the same order, is evaluated in Sec. VI.\par

                 The result for the relativistic correction is 7.13
                 Mc/sec, and is in agreement with the result of Karplus,
                 Klein, and Schwinger which was obtained by an
                 independent method. The result for the complete Lamb
                 shift has been given in a recent paper by Salpeter. The
                 small remaining discrepancy of 0.6 Mc/sec between
                 theory and experiment might be due to the next order
                 relativistic correction which should be of order
                 $\alpha (Z \alpha )^6 \ln(Z \alpha)$.",

  abstract =     "The properties of liquid helium at very low
                 temperatures (below $0.5^\circ K$) are discussed from
                 the atomic point of view. It is argued that the lowest
                 states are compressional waves (phonons). Long-range
                 motions which leave density unaltered (stirrings) are
                 impossible for Bose statistics since they simply
                 permute the atoms. Motions on an atomic scale are
                 possible, but require a minimum energy of excitation.
                 Therefore at low temperature the specific heat varies
                 as $T^3$ and the flow resistance of the fluid is small.
                 The arguments are entirely qualitative no calculation
                 of the energy of excitation nor of the low-temperature
                 viscosity is given. In an appendix an expression,
                 previously given, for the partition function is
                 modified to include the effects of phonons.",

  abstract =     "It is shown from first principles that, in spite of
                 the large interatomic forces, liquid He$^4$ should
                 exhibit a transition analogous to the transition in an
                 ideal Bose--Einstein gas. The exact partition function
                 is written as an integral over trajectories, using the
                 space-time approach to quantum mechanics. It is next
                 argued that the motion of one atom through the others
                 is not opposed by a potential barrier because the
                 others may move out of the way. This just increases the
                 effective inertia of the moving atom. This permits a
                 simpler form to be written for the partition function.
                 A rough analysis of this form shows the existence of a
                 transition, but of the third order. It is possible that
                 a more complete analysis would show that the transition
                 implied by the simplified partition function is
                 actually like the experimental one.",

  abstract =     "It is argued that the wave function representing an
                 excitation in liquid helium should be nearly of the
                 form $\sum if(r_i) \phi$, where $\phi$ is the
                 ground-state wave function, $f(r)$ is some function of
                 position, and the sum is taken over each atom $i$. In
                 the variational principle this trial function minimizes
                 the energy if $f(r) = \exp(ik \cdot r)$, the energy
                 value being $E(k) = \hbar^2 k^2 / 2m S(k)$, where
                 $S(k)$ is the structure factor of the liquid for
                 neutron scattering. For small $k$, $E$ rises linearly
                 (phonons). For larger $k$, $S(k)$ has a maximum which
                 makes a ring in the diffraction pattern and a minimum
                 in the $E(k)$ vs $k$ curve. Near the minimum, $E(k)$
                 behaves as $\Delta + \hbar^2 (k - k_0)^2 / 2 \mu$,
                 which form Landau found agrees with the data on
                 specific heat. The theoretical value of $\Delta$ is
                 twice too high, however, indicating need of a better
                 trial function.\par

                 Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all
                 essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau.
                 The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the
                 two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view
                 is not adequate to deal with the details of the
                 $\lambda$ transition and with problems of critical flow
                 velocity.\par

                 In a dilute solution of He$^3$ atoms in He$^4$, the
                 He$^3$ should move essentially as free particles but of
                 higher effective mass. This mass is calculated, in an
                 appendix, to be about six atomic mass units.",

                 excitation (phonon or roton) in liquid helium, inserted
                 into a variational principle for the energy, gave an
                 energy-momentum curve having the qualitative shape
                 suggested by Landau; but the value computed for the
                 minimum energy $\Delta$ of a roton was 19.1$^\circ$K,
                 while thermodynamic data require $\Delta = 9.6^\circ
                 K$. A new wave function is proposed here. The new value
                 computed for $\Delta$ is 11.5$^\circ$K. Qualitatively,
                 the wave function suggests that the roton is a kind of
                 quantum-mechanical analog of a microscopic vortex ring,
                 of diameter about equal to the atomic spacing. A
                 forward motion of single atoms through the center of
                 the ring is accompanied by a dipole distribution of
                 returning flow far from the ring.\par

                 In the computation both the two-atom and three-atom
                 correlation functions appear. The former is known from
                 x-rays, while for the latter the Kirkwood approximation
                 of a product of three two-atom correlation functions is
                 used. A method is developed to estimate and correct for
                 most of the error caused by this approximation, so that
                 the residual uncertainty due to this source is
                 negligible.",

                 neutrons scattered from liquid He II would permit a
                 determination of the energy-versus-momentum relation
                 for the elementary excitations (phonons and rotons) in
                 the liquid. A major part of the scattering at a fixed
                 angle arises from production or annihilation of a
                 single excitation and appears as sharp lines in the
                 energy spectrum. From the position of these lines the
                 energy-versus-momentum relation of the excitations can
                 be inferred. Other processes, such as production or
                 annihilation of multiple excitations, contribute a
                 continuous background, and occur at a negligible rate
                 if the incident neutrons are slow ($\lambda \geq
                 4{\AA}$) and the helium cold ($T < 2^\circ K$). The
                 total cross-section data can be accounted for by

                 proposed to represent excitations, agrees with

                 Line widths in the discrete spectrum are negligible at

  abstract =     "The representation of Fermi particles by two-component
                 Pauli spinors satisfying a second order differential
                 equation and the suggestion that in $\beta$ decay these
                 spinors act without gradient couplings leads to an
                 essentially unique weak four-fermion coupling. It is
                 equivalent to equal amounts of vector and axial vector
                 coupling with two-component neutrinos and conservation
                 of leptons. (The relative sign is not determined
                 theoretically.) It is taken to be ``universal''; the
                 lifetime of the $\mu$ agrees to within the experimental
                 errors of 2\%. The vector part of the coupling is, by
                 analogy with electric charge, assumed to be not
                 renormalized by virtual mesons. This requires, for
                 example, that pions are also ``charged'' in the sense
                 that there is a direct interaction in which, say, a
                 $\pi^0$ goes to $\pi^-$ and an electron goes to a
                 neutrino. The weak decays of strange particles will
                 result qualitatively if the universality is extended to
                 include a coupling involving a $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$
                 fermion. Parity is then not conserved even for those
                 decays like $K \to 2 \pi$ or $3 \pi$ which involve no
                 neutrinos. The theory is at variance with the measured
                 angular correlation of electron and neutrino in He$^6$,
                 and with the fact that fewer than $10^{-4}$ pion decay
                 into electron and neutrino.",

  abstract =     "We have obtained an approximate expression for the
                 impedance function at all frequencies, temperatures,
                 and coupling strengths of an electron coupled to a
                 polar lattice (a system commonly called a polaron). The
                 starting point for the calculation is the quantum
                 mechanical expression for the expected current. The
                 phonon coordinates are eliminated from this expression
                 by well-known field-theory techniques. The resulting
                 exact ``influence functional'' is then approximated by
                 a corresponding quadratic ``influence functional'
                 which, it is hoped, imitates the real polaron.
                 Correction terms are computed to account for the
                 difference between the approximate impedance and the
                 exact polaron impedance in a manner closely analogous
                 to Feynman's treatment of the polaron self-energy. In
                 fact, the analytic evaluation of the expression for the
                 impedance obtained here is carried out using the
                 approximate ``influence functional'' that was
                 successfully employed in minimizing the binding (and
                 free) energy of the polaron in earlier calculations.
                 However, the accuracy obtained using this
                 approximation, for the impedance calculation, is less
                 satisfactory and its limitations are discussed.
                 Nevertheless, beginning at intermediate coupling
                 strengths, the approximate impedance produces a level
                 structure of increasing complexity and narrowing
                 resonances as the coupling strengthens. This suggests
                 that further refinements may be fruitful. Methods for
                 finding a better quadratic influence functional for use
                 in our impedance expression as well as ways of
                 improving the expression further are suggested. A
                 comparison of our results with those of the Boltzmann
                 equation points up interesting differences which arise
                 from reversing the order of taking limits of zero
                 frequency and coupling.",

  abstract =     "We have a habit in writing articles published in
                 scientific journals to make the work as finished as
                 possible, to cover up all the tracks, to not worry
                 about the blind alleys or to describe how you had the
                 wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn't any place
                 to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually
                 did in order to get to do the work although there has
                 been in these days some interest in this kind of thing.
                 Since winning the prize is a personal thing, I thought
                 I could be excused in this particular situation if I
                 were to talk personally about my relationship to
                 quantum electrodynamics, rather than to discuss the
                 subject itself in a refined and finished fashion.
                 Furthermore, since there are three people who have won
                 the prize in physics, if they are all going to be
                 talking about quantum electrodynamics itself, one might
                 become bored with the subject. So what I would like to
                 tell you about today is the sequence of events, really
                 the sequence of ideas, which occurred, and by which I
                 finally came out the other end with an unsolved problem
                 for which I ultimately received a prize",

                 acquired by an electron interacting with the
                 longitudinal, optical phonons of a polar crystal in a
                 finite electric field is analyzed quantum mechanically
                 for arbitrary coupling strength, field strength, and
                 temperature. The rate of loss of momentum by an
                 electron drifting through the crystal in the applied
                 field is expressed in a form in which the lattice
                 coordinates (the phonons) have been eliminated exactly
                 by path-integral methods. This expression is then
                 evaluated by a path-integral approach similar to that
                 used to calculate the impedance of electrons in polar
                 crystals. We present numerical calculations of field
                 (loss of energy per unit distance) versus velocity for
                 three coupling strengths using the Fr{\"o}hlich polaron
                 model. In a single curve, all the expected phenomena
                 appear, including a threshold field for producing hot
                 electrons and a decreasing rate of energy loss with
                 velocity for very fast electrons. Using only the
                 experimentally measured values of the reststrahlen
                 energy and the static and optical dielectric constants,
                 we find an energy loss of 0.025 eV/{\AA} for electrons
                 near the threshold in Al$_2$O$_3$, which compares
                 favorably with the experimental value of about 0.03
                 eV/{\AA}. We conclude that optical-phonon scattering
                 can indeed produce the high rate of energy loss that is
                 present in tunnel-cathode structures.",

  abstract =     "A relativistic equation to represent the symmetric
                 quark model of hadrons with harmonic interaction is
                 used to define and calculate matrix elements of vector
                 and axial-vector currents. Elements between states with
                 large mass differences are too big compared to
                 experiment, so a factor whose functional form involves
                 one arbitrary constant is introduced to compensate
                 this. The vector elements are compared with experiments
                 on photoelectric meson production, $K_\beta$ decay, and
                 $\omega \to \pi \gamma$. Pseudoscalar-meson decay
                 widths of hadrons are calculated supposing the
                 amplitude is proportional (with one new scale constant)
                 to the divergence of the axial-vector current matrix
                 elements. Starting only from these two constants, the
                 slope of the Regge trajectories, and the masses of the
                 particles, 75 matrix elements are calculated, of which
                 more than 3/4 agree with the experimental values within

  abstract =     "We investigate the consequences of the assumption that
                 the high-transverse-momentum particles seen in
                 hadron-hadron collisions are produced by a single,
                 hard, large-angle elastic scattering of quarks, one
                 from the target and one from the beam. The fast
                 outgoing quarks are assumed to fragment into a cascade
                 jet of hadrons. The distributions of quarks in the
                 incoming hadrons are determined from lepton--hadron
                 inelastic scattering data, together with certain
                 theoretical constraints such as sum rules, etc. The
                 manner in which quarks cascade into hadrons is
                 determined from particle distributions seen in
                 lepton--hadron and lepton--lepton collisions
                 supplemented by theoretical arguments. The quark
                 elastic scattering cross section is parametrized in a
                 purely phenomenological way and the choice $d\sigma /dt
                 = 2.3 \times 10^6/(-s t^3) \mu b \mathrm{GeV}^_6$ gives
                 a reasonable fit to all the data for hadron + hadron
                 meson + anything for $p_\perp \geq 2 \mathrm{GeV}/c$.
                 Many predictions do not depend sensitively on the exact
                 form for $d\sigma /dt$ and therefore test our basic
                 assumption. The data examined include single-particle
                 production in pp collisions at various energies and
                 angles. Particle ratios ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $K^+$,
                 $K^-$, and $\eta$) are predicted and discussed. In
                 addition, the ratio of production of $\pi^0$'s by beams
                 of $\pi^+$ and protons on a proton target is explained.
                 With this model we have found no serious inconsistency
                 with data, but several predictions for charge ratios
                 and beam ratios at other angles are presented that have
                 yet to be tested experimentally.",

  abstract =     "It is shown that if, in a calculation of
                 high-transverse-momentum (p ) meson production in
                 hadron-hadron collisions, one includes not only the
                 scale-breaking effects that might be expected from
                 asymptotically free theories but also the effects due
                 to the transverse momentum of quarks in hadrons and
                 further adds contributions from quark-gluon and
                 gluon-gluon scattering to those of quark-quark
                 scattering then the results are not inconsistent with
                 the data. The approach yields the correct magnitude and
                 an apparent approximate $1 / p_\perp^8$ behavior in
                 accord with single-particle data for the energy range
                 currently observed. Two-particle correlations are
                 examined. Because of scale-breaking effects and the
                 presence of gluons, the theory does not have the
                 problem of predicting too many away-side hadrons at
                 large $p_\perp$ as did an earlier quark-quark
                 scattering ``black-box'' approach. We conclude that the
                 quantum-chromodynamics approach is in reasonable accord
                 with the data although theoretical uncertainties
                 (especially at low $p_\perp$) make incontrovertible
                 conclusions impossible at present. Crucial tests of the
                 theory require higher $p_\perp$ than are now available;
                 estimates for this region are made.",

                 I got a call from William Graham, who was the acting
                 director of NASA. Mr. Graham had been a student of
                 mine---at Caltech, and also at the Hughes Aircraft
                 Company, where I gave a series of lectures---and
                 thought maybe I would be of some use to the
                 investigation. When I heard it would be in Washington,
                 my immediate reaction was not to do it. I have a
                 principle of not going anywhere near Washington or

                 superconductivity, and quantum mechanics, Feynman's

                 We conclude that Feynman was not interested in building
                 miniaturized versions of existing macroscopic machines,
                 but wished to construct microbiological machines and

                 be the best introductory set of lectures on physics
                 ever written. Feynman himself, however, stated in his
                 original preface that he was ``pessimistic'' with
                 regard to the success with which he reached all of his
                 students. The Feynman lectures were written ``to
                 maintain the interest of very enthusiastic and rather
                 smart students coming out of high schools and into Cal
                 Tech.'' Feynman was targeting the lectures to students
                 who, ``at the end of two years of our previous course,
                 [were] very discouraged because there were really very
                 few grand, new, modern ideas presented to them.'' As a
                 result, some physics students find the lectures more
                 valuable after they obtain a good grasp of physics by
                 studying more traditional texts. Many professional
                 physicists refer to the lectures at various points in
                 their careers to refresh their minds with regard to
                 basic principles.",

                 Alamos to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the
                 laboratory. This volume contains the papers presented
                 in that meeting. It presents many of the important
                 advances made in physics over the intervening forty
                 years and provides an idea of the possibilities for the
                 future. Among the contributors are eight Nobel
                 Laureates. The contents include: Los Alamos in the
                 1980s; tiny computers obeying quantum mechanical laws;
                 present, and future of nuclear magnetic resonance;
                 experimental evidence that an asteroid impact led to
                 the extinction of many species 65 million years ago;
                 the lunar laboratory; the future of particle
                 accelerators: Post WWII and now; models, hypotheses and
                 approximations; comments on three thermonuclear paths
                 for the synthesis of helium; and the sad augurs mock
                 their own passage; experiments on time reversal
                 symmetry and parity; on the course of our magnetic
                 fusion energy enterprise; early days in the Lawrence
                 Laboratory; nuclear charge distribution in fission;
                 developing larger software systems; reflections on
                 style in physics; tuning up the TPC; remarks on the
                 future of particle physics; supernova theory; how well
                 we meant; history and the hierarchy of structure.",
