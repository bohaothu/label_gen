ABSTRACT::

The far ultraviolet spectra of the four starburst galaxies NGC&nbsp;6090,
Mrk&nbsp;66, Mrk&nbsp;1267, and IRAS&nbsp;0833+6517 were observed with HUT
during the Astro-2 mission. Additional data were obtained for
IRAS&nbsp;0833+6517 with the HST+GHRS. We analyse the observations in terms
of the stellar content and the kinematics of the interstellar medium, and
we discuss the implications of these results for the interpretation of the
ultraviolet spectra of high-redshift galaxies.
 <P>
Evolutionary synthesis models are used to constrain the star formation
history from the absolute ultraviolet flux and from the stellar components of
the absorption lines SiIV and CIV, and from the far ultraviolet lines
OVI+L<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/beta.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=10 ALIGN=absbottom>+CII. The
spectral energy distributions from these models are used as input to the
photoionization code CLOUDY to predict [OIII]/H<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/beta.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=10 ALIGN=absbottom> and the column densities of the cool component
of the ionized gas (SiII and CII) associated with the HII region. The results
indicate continuous star formation during about 9 Myr or, alternatively,
bursts with an age between 3 and 6 Myr, and a mass consistent with that from
the H<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/alpha.gif" HEIGHT=8 WIDTH=10> flux. Evidence for significant
dilution by a field star population is found in all galaxies, except
NGC&nbsp;6090.
 <P>
Most of the interstellar absorption lines are saturated. Their equivalent
widths indicate a large velocity dispersion in the gas. Other evidence for
large scale-motions of the interstellar gas comes from blueshifts of
several hundred km s<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>-1</SUP></FONT> with respect to the
systemic velocity in the interstellar lines of NGC&nbsp;6090, Mrk&nbsp;66,
and IRAS&nbsp;0833+6517. These outflows are most likely driven by the
starburst.
 <P>
L<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/alpha.gif" HEIGHT=8 WIDTH=10> was detected in emission in three
of the galaxies (NGC&nbsp;6090, Mrk&nbsp;66, and IRAS&nbsp;0833+6517). The
dereddened ratio L<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/alpha.gif" HEIGHT=8 WIDTH=10>/H<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/beta.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=10 ALIGN=absbottom> in IRAS&nbsp;0833+6517 is
close to the recombination value, indicating that extinction is more important
than multiple resonant scattering effects. However, the GHRS spectrum of
IRAS&nbsp;0833+6517 clearly shows that the emision profile of
L<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/alpha.gif" HEIGHT=8 WIDTH=10> is asymmetric, with the blue
wing being absorbed by neutral gas. This indicates that the velocity
structure of the neutral gas and the scattering by HI atoms can
play an important role in the escape of the
L<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/alpha.gif" HEIGHT=8 WIDTH=10> photons as well.
