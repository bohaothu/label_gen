Query Language) is presented by translating SQL into an extended

laid on the correct translation of grouping and aggregation of
SQL. The translation of an SQL query is performed in eight steps. Some
steps can be omitted for most of the queries. Making use of the
presented translation, it is possible to prove properties of SQL,
e.g. subqueries which are added with IN, ALL, or EXISTS can be
replaced equivalently by subqueries using the aggregation function

appropriate components. Context sensitive conditions are translated
into integrity constraints formulated in the calculus. This approach
especially allows to describe various degrees of incompleteness of ACT

for conceptual modeling of information systems.  It is designed to
describe the Universe of Discourse (UoD) as a system of concurrently
existing and interacting objects, i.e., an object community.  The
first part of the talk introduces the various language concepts
offered by TROLL light.  The second part of our paper outlines a
simplified computational model for TROLL light. After introducing
signatures for collections of object types we explain how single
states of an object community are constructed. By parallel occurrence
of a finite set of events the states of object communities change. The
object community itself is regarded as a graph where the nodes are the
object community states reachable from an initial state and the edges
represent transitions between states.}"

abstract  ="{Different approaches support the construction of software by
representing certain aspects of a system graphically. Recently, the
UML has become common to provide software designers with tools, in
which they can create visual representations of software
interactively. But the UML is intended to be drawn on two-dimensional
surfaces. Our approach extends UML into a third and fourth dimension
in a way that we can place both static and dynamic aspects in one
single view. By this, we can show behavior in the context of
structural aspects, instead of drawing different diagrams for each
aspect with only loose relation to each other.  We also use the third
dimension to emphasize important things and to place less interesting
things in the background. Thereby, we direct the viewer's attention to
the important things in the foreground.  Currently, UML shows dynamic
behavior by diagrams which do not change and are therefore static in
nature. In sequence diagrams, for example, time elapses from the top
of the diagram to the bottom.  We point out that behavior is better
visualized by animated diagrams where message symbols move from the
sender object to the receiver object. Our approach supports the
creation of a system as well as the communication of its dynamic
processes especially to customers.}"

precise understanding of UML class models and their interpretation,
(3) a solid foundation for implementing CASE tools supporting
analysis, simulation and validation of UML models.  We also feel that
there is one aspect of OCL which often gets underrated. OCL
expressions cannot only be used to specify constraints, but more
generally, one can utilize them to specify queries retrieving
non-trivial information about certain objects in a given system state.
These queries can then be translated into statements of a query
language of the chosen implementation environment. A precise OCL
semantics would obviously facilitate a more systematic description of
a translation scheme from OCL to e.g. SQL or the ODMG's Object Query
Language (OQL).}"

the non-core language features is given by a translation into the core,

necessary in the metamodel of UML, and secondary features possessed by

of existing programs. However, the inherent structure of UML diagrams,
which consists of graphical as well as textual information, makes it
difficult to read and oversee large diagrams generated from complex
systems. The view on such diagrams can be compared with taking a look
at a detailed map: the reader has to decide whether to read the fine
details or to view the whole structure.  We present approaches to
overcome this problem by using object-oriented metrics for program
analysis and location of submodules in diagrams that belong together
in terms of coupling.  The shown techniques have been implemented into
our reverse engineering tool Idea, which allows interactive selection
and isolation of coherent regions of class diagrams.}"

of UML models and OCL constraints. We focus on models and constraints
specified in the analysis and early design stage of a software
development process. For this purpose, a suitable subset of UML
corresponding to information that is usually represented in class
diagrams is identified and formally defined. This basic modeling
language provides a context for all OCL constraints. We define a
formal syntax and semantics of OCL types, operations, expressions,
invariants, and pre-/postconditions. We also give solutions for
problems with the current OCL definition and discuss possible
extensions.  A metamodel for OCL is introduced that defines the
abstract syntax of OCL expressions and the structure of types and
values. The metamodel approach allows a seamless integration with the
UML metamodeling architecture and makes the benefits of a precise OCL
definition easier accessible. The OCL metamodel also allows to define
context-sensitive conditions for well-formed OCL expressions more
precisely. These conditions can now be specified with OCL whereas they
previously were specified only informally.  % In order to demonstrate
the practical applicability of our work, we have realized substantial
parts of it in a tool supporting the validation of models and
constraints. Design specifications can be ``executed'' and animated
thus providing early feedback in an iterative development process. Our
approach offers novel ways for checking user data against
specifications, for automating test procedures, and for checking CASE
tools for standards conformance.  Therefore, this work contributes to
the goal of improving the overall quality of software systems by
combining theoretical and practical techniques.}"

difficulties are that constraints are used in the stereotype context
in two completely different ways and that no full support of

abstract ="{Reverse engineering techniques have been applied successfully in
software maintenance, reengineering, as well as traditional software
engineering processes for many years. With the establishment of the
UML as a standard for modeling of object-oriented software systems,
many new opportunities but also challenges have opened up in the new
field of UML-based reverse engineering. In this dissertation thesis,
techniques for application of the UML in static design recovery as
well as metric-based static software analysis are presented, with a
focus on programs written in Java. To address the problem of uniquely
representing aspects of existing programs in UML diagrams, a metamodel
for the Java language has been developed. It serves as a foundation
for a standardized metamodel-level translation scheme between Java and
the UML. Based on this scheme, techniques for recovering the abstract
design of a software system from the implementation model are
introduced. The focus of these is on design recovery strategies for
recognition of advanced UML class diagram features. When reverse
engineering non-trivial software systems, the resulting amount of
information is often huge. One of the central problems of UML diagrams
is the tradeoff between detailed rendering and lack of space and
readability: Even for programs of average size, the resulting diagrams
tend to become quickly too large for comfortable viewing. In addition
to metricbased analysis techniques, which help to understand the
software by integrating metrics and UML diagrams, we present a
metric-based approach for identification of logical substructures in a
software architecture, which helps to partition the system and thus
make it easier comprehensible. The techniques presented in this
dissertation have been implemented in the reverse engineering tool
IDEA, a system for static analysis of Java programs. IDEA supports
generation of both UML class as well as activity diagrams from source
code. Concerning its primary functionality, static design recovery, it
is possible to recognize many of UML s advanced notational features in
an interactive process. Furthermore, the calculation of metrics is
supported and used both for integration in extended UML class
diagrams, as well as for metric-based analyses. The approaches
presented in this dissertation thesis contribute to the research field
of reverse engineering, by showing novel ways to redocument and
analyse object-oriented software systems using the graphical UML
notation. Thereby, they help to improve a general understanding of how
to apply the UML in reverse engineering and static program analysis.}"

covariant overriding rule for methods, attributes, and associations.

in programming languages and we discuss which consequences arise when
implementing UML models in programming languages.  Second, weaknesses
of the UML~2.0 metamodel and the textual explanations are addressed
and solutions, which could be incorporated with minor efforts are
proposed. Despite of these weaknesses we generally agree with the

approach models layered graphs with a UML class diagram, and
operations and invariants are formally characterized with OCL and are
validated with the USE tool. Metamodeling properties like strictness

represents the state of the system at a specific point in time during
execution is likewise introduced by means of a metamodel. The simulated
system run is performed by applying graph transformation rules on the

RE (Relational) database schema into a collection of RE database

collection of ER database states into a collection of RE database
states. These four separate transformations may be viewed as a single
transformation between the ER datamodel and the RE datamodel. The
schemas are regarded as determining the syntax of the datamodels, and
the set of associated states is regarded as being the semantics of the
datamodels, because the states associate meaning with the
schemas. When one usually considers database models, one formally only
treats syntactical aspects, i.e., schemas, and handles the semantics
merely informally. Our approach allows to formally handle syntax and
semantics of database models and their transformation within a single
and uniform framework. The approach thus allows to precisely describe
properties of the datamodels and properties of the transformation. The
method behind our approach is to divide a language into a syntax and
semantics part and to describe a transformation between two languages
as a direction-neutral affair. Formal properties of the languages to
be transformed and formal properties of the transformation are
described uniformly. Transformation properties can be properties
regarding syntax and semantics. The method can be applied not only to
database languages but to transformations between common computer
science languages.}"

database models are considered, one formally only treats syntactical
aspects, i.e., schemas, and handles the semantics, i.e., states,
merely informally. Our approach formally handles syntax and semantics
of database models and their transformation within a single, uniform
framework. The approach thus precisely describes properties of the
datamodels and properties of the transformation. Our metamodel
transformations do not simply convert ER schemas into Relational
schemas, but they respect the semantics in a formal way and they can
also be used the other way round in order to transfrom Relational
schemas into ER ones. This opens the approach for re-engineering as
well.}"

discusses the view that model transformations can be abstracted as
being transformation models. As a simple example for a transformation
model, the well-known transformation from the Entity-Relationship
model to the Relational model is shown. A transformation model in this
contribution is nothing more than an ordinary, simple model, i.e., a

model may transport syntax and semantics of the described domain. The
contribution thus covers two views on transformations: An operational
model transformation view and a descriptive transformation model view.}"

modeling using UML (Unified Modeling Language), OCL (Object Constraint

application domains, technologies, visions and paradigms used in
modeling, the formalisms and techniques currently used have to support
development of large scale applications. Therefore, efficiency
represents another important feature that tools supporting OCL must
provide. The OCL is required to ensure a fine balance between the use
of language in specifying models realized in early life-cycle phases
and the rigor asked by the strong relationship with formal
languages. Fixing ambiguities reported from the OCL specification
without affecting the above mentioned balance is also important.
Today, promoting OCL needs a conjoint support from both the research
community and the industry. The main target of the OCLApps 2006

UML can be integrated into a single visual semanticmodel. It discusses
UML models composed of class, object, state, sequence and
collaboration diagrams and presents an integrated semantics of these
models. As formal basis the theoretically well-founded area of graph
transformation is employed which supports a visual and rule-based
transformation of UML model states. For the translation of a UML model
into a graph transformation system the operations in class diagrams
and the transitions in state diagrams are associatedwith graph
transformation rules that are then combined into one system in order
to obtain a single coherent semantic description. Operation calls in
sequence and collaboration diagrams can be associated with
applications of graph transformation rules in the constructed graph
transformation system so that valid sequence and collaboration
diagrams correspond to derivations, i.e., to sequences of graph
transformation rule applications. The main aim of this paper is to
provide a formal framework that supports visual simulation of
integrated UML specifications in which system states and state changes
are modeled in a straighforward way.}"

approaches for MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) depend on OCL.  However,
OCL is present not only in these areas influenced by the OMG but also
in the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).  Thus the quality of OCL and
its realization in tools seems to be crucial for the success of
model-driven development.  Surprisingly, up to now a benchmark for OCL
to measure quality properties has not been proposed.  This paper puts
forward in the first part the concepts of a comprehensive OCL
benchmark. Our benchmark covers (A) OCL engine accuracy (e.g., for the
undefined value and the use of variables), (B) OCL engine
determinateness properties (e.g., for the collection operations any
and flatten), and (C) OCL engine efficiency (for data type and
user-defined operations). In the second part, this paper empirically
evaluates the proposed benchmark concepts by examining a number of OCL
tools.  The paper discusses several differences in handling particular
OCL language features and underspecifications in the OCL standard.}"

factor. How to integrate TGGs and OCL is a topic of ongoing research

for this integration: One part of this language has a one-one mapping
to TGGs and the remaining part covers OCL concepts. The language is
realized in our tool UML-based Specification Environment (USE) by
taking two views on operations derived from TGG rules: Declarative OCL
pre- and postconditions are employed as operation contracts, and
imperative command sequences are taken as an operational
realization. USE offers full OCL support for restricting models and
metamodels with invariants, for checking pre- and postconditions of
operations as well as for validating and animating transformation
operations. Our approach covers a complete realization of TGGs

interest in the security community, organizations still seek a
flexible and effective approach to impose role-based authorization

today often only basic RBAC concepts have found their way into
commercial RBAC products; specifically, authorization constraints are
not widely supported. In this paper, we present an RBAC administration
tool that can enforce certain kinds of role-based authorization
constraints such as separation of duty constraints. The authorization
constraint functionality is based upon the OCL validation tool USE. We

abstract  ="{In this paper, a new metamodel for workflows is described by using
UML. The underlying UML class diagram is formally extended with OCL
pre- and postconditions for operations and OCL invariants for system
states. The metamodel allows the developer to specify processes,
activities in processes and temporal relations between them. Known
workflow patterns are formally captured in the metamodel and
sophisticated temporal relations between activities can be expressed
easily. Development of workflow models is explained as well as process
instantiation and process execution on the basis of a tool realizing
parts of the UML action semantics. Prototypical process execution and
animation allows the designer to discover properties of the designed
processes and activities in early phases of the development without
the need for building a full implementation.}"

abstract  ="{Model transformation (MT) testing is gaining interest as the size and
complexity of MTs grows. In general it is very difficult and expensive
(time and computational complexity-wise) to validate in full the
correctness of a MT. This paper presents a cost effective MT testing
approach based on the concept of Tract, which is a generalization of
the concept of Model Transformation Contract. A Tract defines a set of
constraints on the source and target metamodels, a set of
source-target constraints, and a tract test suite, i.e., a collection
of source models satisfying the source constraints. We automatically
generate input test suite models, which are then transformed into
output models by the transformation under test, and the results
checked with the USE tool (UML-based Specification Environment)
against the constraints defined for the transformation. We show the
different kinds of tests that can be conducted over a MT using this
automated process, and the kinds of problems it can help uncovering.}"
