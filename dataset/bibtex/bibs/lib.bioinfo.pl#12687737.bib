abstract={Increasingly, medical information is being stored, accessed, and communicated electronically, which makes this information vulnerable to breaches in security and privacy. Clinicians must be familiar with the best practices for keeping medical information private, as well as the local, state, and federal regulations that govern the security, privacy and patient-identifiable information. Noncompliance carries the potential for civil and criminal penalties.}
