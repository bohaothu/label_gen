Strictly layered feedforward networks with binary neurons are viewed as maps from the vertex set of an n-cube to the vertex set of an l-cube. With only one output neuron, they can in principle realize any Boolean function on n inputs. We address the problem of determining the necessary and sufficient numbers of hidden units for this task by using separability properties of affine oriented hyperplane arrangements. },

Spatial interdependences of multiple stochastic units can be suitably quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the joint probability distribution from the corresponding factorized distribution. In the present paper, a generalized measure for stochastic interaction, which also captures temporal interdependences, is analysed within the setting of Markov chains. The dynamical properties of systems with strongly interacting stochastic units are analytically studied and illustrated by computer simulations. In particular, the emergence of determinism in such systems is demonstrated.},

@article{Wennekers2003Spatial-and-Temporal,
	Abstract = {Summary
The observation of various types of spatio-temporal correlations in
spikepatterns of multiple cortical neurons has shifted attention from rate
coding paradigms to computational processes based on the precise timing of
spikes in neuronal ensembles. In the present work we develop the notion of
''spatial'' and ''temporal interaction'' which provides measures for statistical
dependences in coupled stochastic processes like multiple unit spike trains. We
show that the classical Willshaw network and Abeles' synfire chain model both
reveal a moderate spatial interaction, but only the synfire chain model reveals
a positive temporal interaction, too. Systems that maximize temporal interaction
are shown to be almost deterministic globally, but posses almost unpredictable
firing behavior on the single unit level.},

The definition takes phase coexistence into account by taking the infimum over the translation-invariant Gibbs measures of an interaction potential. It is shown that this infimum is attained in a pure state. An explicit formula can be found for the Ising square lattice, where the quantity is proved to be maximized at the phase-transition point. By this, phase coexistence is linked to high model complexity in a rigorous way.},

	Abstract = {In all but special circumstances, measurements of time-dependent processes reflect internal structures and correlations only indirectly. Building predictive models of such hidden information sources requires discovering, in some way, the internal states and mechanisms. Unfortunately, there are often many possible models that are observationally equivalent. Here we show that the situation is not as arbitrary as one would think. We show that generators of hidden stochastic processes can be reduced to a minimal form and compare this reduced representation to that provided by computational mechanics -- the ε-machine. On the way to developing deeper, measure-theoretic foundations for the latter, we introduce a new two-step reduction process. The first step (internal-event reduction) produces the smallest observationally equivalent σ-algebra and the second (internal-state reduction) removes σ-algebra components that are redundant for optimal prediction. For several classes of stochastic dynamical systems these reductions produce representations that are equivalent to ε-machines.},

      The closure of a discrete exponential family is described by a finite set of equations corresponding to the circuits of an underlying oriented matroid.

This description allows for a combinatorial study of the possible support sets in the closure of an exponential family. If two exponential families induce the same oriented matroid, then their closures have the same support sets. Furthermore, the positive cocircuits give a parameterization of the closure of the exponential family.},

However, this seemingly inevitable topological variation is never catastrophic (the dynamic type is preserved) if the dimension of the system is high enough.},

This paper examines the most probable route to chaos a high-dimensional dynamical systems function space (time-delay neural networks) endowed with a probability measure in a computational setting. The most probable route to chaos (relative to the measure we impose on the function space) as the dimension is increased is observed to be a sequence of Neimark-Sacker bifurcations into chaos. The analysis is composed of the study of an example dynamical system followed by a probabilistic study of the ensemble of dynamical systems from which the example was drawn. A scenario depicting the decoupling of the stable manifolds of the torus leading up to the onset of chaos in high-dimensional dissipative dynamical systems is also presented.},

	Abstract = {It has been argued that information processing in the cortex is optimised with regard to certain information theoretic principles. We have, for instance, recently shown that spike-timing dependent plasticity can improve an information-theoretic measure called spatio-temporal stochastic interaction which captures how strongly a set of neurons cooperates in space and time. Systems with high stochastic interaction reveal Poisson spike trains but nonetheless occupy only a strongly reduced area in their global phase space, they reveal repetiting but complex global activation patterns, and they can be interpreted as computational systems operating on selected sets of collective patterns or "global states" in a rule-like manner. In the present work we investigate stochastic interaction in high-resolution EEG-data from cat auditory cortex. Using Kohonen maps to reduce the high-dimensional dynamics of the system, we are able to detect repetiting system states and estimate the stochastic interaction in the data, which turns out to be fairly high. This suggests an organised cooperation in the underlying neural networks which cause the data and may reflect generic intrinsic computational capabilities of the cortex.},

We provide a geometric framework for investigating the robustness of information flows over biological networks. We use information measures to quantify the impact of knockout perturbations on simple networks. Robustness has two components, a measure of the causal contribution of a node or nodes, and a measure of the change or exclusion dependence, of the network following node removal. Causality is measured as statistical contribution of a node to network function, whereas exclusion dependence measures a distance between unperturbed network and reconfigured network function.We explore the role that redundancy plays in increasing robustness, and how redundacy can be exploited through error-correcting codes implemented by networks. We provide examples of the robustness measure when applied to familiar boolean functions such as the AND, OR and XOR functions. We discuss the relationship between robustness measures and related measures of complexity and how robustness always implies a minimal level of complexity.},

This extends work by Bernstein and Vazirani who have shown that there is a UQTM that can simulate every other QTM for an arbitrary, but preassigned number of time steps. As a corollary to this result, we give a rigorous proof that quantum Kolmogorov complexity as defined by Berthiaume is invariant, i.e., depends on the choice of the UQTM only up to an additive constant. Our proof is based on a new mathematical framework for QTMs, including a thorough analysis of their halting behavior. We introduce the notion of mutually orthogonal halting spaces and show that the information encoded in an input qubit string can always be effectively decomposed into a classical and a quantum part.},

@article{Ay2008Predictive-information-and,
	Abstract = {Abstract.~~Measures of complexity are of immediate interest for the field of autonomous robots both as a means to classify the behavior and as an objective function for the autonomous development of robot behavior. In the present paper we consider predictive information in sensor space as a measure for the behavioral complexity of a two-wheel embodied robot moving in a rectangular arena with several obstacles. The mutual information (MI) between past and future sensor values is found empirically to have a maximum for a behavior which is both explorative and sensitive to the environment. This makes predictive information a prospective candidate as an objective function for the autonomous development of such behaviors. We derive theoretical expressions for the MI in order to obtain an explicit update rule for the gradient ascent dynamics. Interestingly, in the case of a linear or linearized model of the sensorimotor dynamics the structure of the learning rule derived depends only on the dynamical properties while the value of the MI influences only the learning rate. In this way the problem of the prohibitively large sampling times for information theoretic measures can be circumvented. This result can be generalized and may help to derive explicit learning rules from complexity theoretic measures.   },

	Abstract = {Effective complexity measures the information content of the regularities of an object. It has been introduced by Gell-Mann and Lloyd to avoid some of the disadvantages of Kolmogorov complexity. In this paper, we derive a precise definition of effective complexity in terms of algorithmic information theory. We analyze rigorously its basic properties such as effective simplicity of incompressible binary strings and existence of strings that have effective complexity close to their lengths. Since some of the results have appeared independently in the context of algorithmic statistics by Ga #x0301;cs , we discuss the relation of effective complexity to the corresponding complexity measures, in particular to Kolmogorov minimal sufficient statistics. As our main new result we show a remarkable relation between effective complexity and Bennett's logical depth: If the effective complexity of a string x exceeds a certain explicit threshold then that string must have astronomically large depth; otherwise, the depth can be arbitrarily small.},

@article{Herzog2010Binomial-edge-ideals,
	Abstract = {
We introduce binomial edge ideals attached to a simple graph G and study their algebraic properties. We characterize those graphs for which the quadratic generators form a Gr{\"o}bner basis in a lexicographic order induced by a vertex labeling. Such graphs are chordal and claw-free. We give a reduced squarefree Gr{\"o}bner basis for general G. It follows that all binomial edge ideals are radical ideals. Their minimal primes can be characterized by particular subsets of the vertices of G. We provide sufficient conditions for Cohen-Macaulayness for closed and nonclosed graphs.
Binomial edge ideals arise naturally in the study of conditional independence ideals. Our results apply for the class of conditional independence ideals where a fixed binary variable is independent of a collection of other variables, given the remaining ones. In this case the primary decomposition has a natural statistical interpretation.},

	Abstract = {We present Binomials, a package for the computer algebra system Macaulay 2, which specializes well-known algorithms to binomial ideals. These come up frequently in algebraic statistics and commutative algebra, and it is shown that significant speedup of computations like primary decomposition is possible. While central parts of the implemented algorithms go back to a paper of Eisenbud and Sturmfels, we also discuss a new algorithm for computing the minimal primes of a binomial ideal. All decompositions make significant use of combinatorial structure found in binomial ideals, and to demonstrate the power of this approach we show how Binomials was used to compute primary decompositions of commuting birth and death ideals of Evans et al., yielding a counterexample for their conjectures.},
