                 provides a powerful means to detect concurrency errors,
                 which are often subtle and difficult to reproduce.
                 Nevertheless, widespread use of this technology by
                 developers is unlikely until tools provide automated
                 support for extracting the required finite-state models
                 directly from program source. Unfortunately, the
                 dynamic features of modern languages such as Java
                 complicate the construction of compact finite-state
                 models for verification. In this article, we show how
                 shape analysis, which has traditionally been used for
                 computing alias information in optimizers, can be used
                 to greatly reduce the size of finite-state models of
                 concurrent Java programs by determining which
                 heap-allocated variables are accessible only by a
                 single thread, and which shared variables are protected
                 by locks. We also provide several other state-space
                 reductions based on the semantics of Java monitors. A
                 prototype of the reductions demonstrates their
                 effectiveness.",

                 pocket computers, we consider applications running in a

                 Java design tradeoffs applicable to pocket computers,
                 and quantify their energy costs. For the design options

  abstract =     "Processors conforming to the IEEE Standard for
                 Floating-Point Arithmetic have been commonplace for
                 some years, and now several programming languages seem
                 to support or conform to this standard, from hereon
                 referred to as ``the IEEE Standard.'' For example, The
                 Java Language Specification by Gosling, Joy, and
                 Steele, which defines the Java language, frequently
                 mentions the IEEE Standard. Indeed, Java, as do other
                 languages, supports some of the features of the IEEE
                 Standard, including a couple floating-point data
                 formats, and even requires (in section 4.2.4
                 ``Floating-Point Operations'' of the aforementioned
                 book) that ``operators on floating-point numbers behave
                 exactly as specified by IEEE 754.'' Arguing that the
                 support current languages offer is not enough, this
                 thesis establishes clear criteria for what it means to
                 fully support the IEEE Standard in a programming
                 language. Each aspect of the IEEE Standard is examined
                 in detail from the point of view of how various
                 arithmetic engines implement that aspect of the IEEE
                 Standard, how different languages (and implementations
                 thereof) support it, and what the range of options are
                 in supporting that aspect. Practical recommendations
                 are then offered (particularly, but not exclusively,
                 for Ada and Java), taking, for example, programmer
                 convenience and impact on performance into
                 consideration. A detailed model specification following
                 these recommendations is provided for the Ada language.
                 In addition, a variety of issues related to the
                 floating-point aspects of programming languages are
                 discussed, so as to serve as a more complete guide to
                 language designers. One such issue is floating-point
                 expression evaluation schemes, and, more specifically,
                 whether bit-for-bit identical results are actually
                 achievable on a variety of platforms that conform to
                 the IEEE Standard, as the Java language promises.
                 Closely tied to this issue is that of double rounding,
                 which occurs when a (possibly intermediate) result is
                 rounded more than once before subsequent use or before
                 being delivered to its final destination. So this
                 thesis discusses when double rounding makes a
                 difference, how it can be avoided, and what the
                 performance impact is in avoiding it.",

  abstract =     "Although mobile code systems typically employ
                 link-time code verifiers to protect host computers from
                 potentially malicious code, implementation flaws in the
                 verifiers may still leave the host system vulnerable to
                 attack. Compounding the inherent complexity of the
                 verification algorithms themselves, the need to support
                 lazy, dynamic linking in mobile code systems typically
                 leads to architectures that exhibit strong
                 interdependencies between the loader, the verifier, and
                 the linker. To simplify verifier construction and
                 provide improved assurances of verifier integrity, we
                 propose a modular architecture based on the concept of
                 proof linking. This architecture encapsulates the
                 verification process and removes dependencies between
                 the loader, the verifier, and the linker. We also
                 formally model the process of proof linking and
                 establish properties to which correct implementations
                 must conform. As an example, we instantiate our
                 architecture for the problem of Java bytecode
                 verification and assess the correctness of this
                 instantiation. Finally, we briefly discuss alternative

  abstract =     "The Java Language Specification (JLS) [Gosling et al.
                 1996] provides an operational definition for the
                 consistency of shared variables. The definition remains
                 unchanged in the JLS 2nd edition, currently under peer
                 review, which relies on a specific abstract machine as
                 its underlying model, is very complicated. Several
                 subsequent works have tried to simplify and formalize
                 it. However, these revised definitions are also
                 operational, and thus have failed to highlight the
                 intuition behind the original specification. In this
                 work we provide a complete nonoperational specification
                 for Java and for the JVM, excluding synchronized
                 operations. We provide a simpler definition, in which
                 we clearly distinguish the consistency model that is
                 promised to the programmer from that which should be
                 implemented in the JVM. This distinction, which was
                 implicit in the original definition, is crucial for
                 building the JVM. We find that the programmer model is
                 strictly weaker than that of the JVM, and precisely
                 define their discrepancy. Moreover, our definition is
                 independent of any specific (or even abstract) machine,
                 and can thus be used to verify JVM implementations and
                 compiler optimizations on any platform. Finally, we
                 show the precise range of consistency relaxations
                 obtainable for the Java memory model when a certain
                 compiler optimization-- called {\em prescient stores\/}
                 in JLS--is applicable.",

  abstract =     "Web server performance in a distributed
                 Object-Oriented (OO) environment is a complex interplay
                 between a variety of factors (e.g., hardware platform,
                 threading model, object scope model, server operating
                 system, network bandwidth, disk file size, caching). In
                 this paper, we present a model-based approach to Web
                 Server performance evaluation in terms of an end-to-end
                 queueing model implemented in a simulation tool. We
                 have applied this model to Active Server Page (ASP) and
                 Common Object Model (COM) technology in Microsoft's
                 Internet Information Server and to the Java Server Page
                 (JSP) and JavaBean technology in both IIS and Netscape
                 Enterprise Server (NES). Our results indicate that for
                 the ASP Script Engine, performance predictions from the
                 simulation model matched the performance observed in a
                 test environment. However, for the JSP Script Engine,
                 the model predicted higher throughput than laboratory
                 test results at high load. This result suggests that
                 Web Server performance can be severely limited by a
                 software bottleneck that causes requests to be
                 serialized. This may cause a request to wait for some
                 resource (i.e., a lock) as opposed to consuming CPU or
                 memory. Implications of these results for Web Server
                 performance in general are discussed",

  abstract =     "This survey describes research directions in
                 techniques to improve the performance of programs
                 written in the Java programming language. The standard
                 technique for Java execution is interpretation, which
                 provides for extensive portability of programs. A Java
                 interpreter dynamically executes Java bytecodes, which
                 comprise the instruction set of the Java Virtual
                 Machine (JVM). Execution time performance of Java
                 programs can be improved through compilation, possibly
                 at the expense of portability. Various types of Java
                 compilers have been proposed, including Just-In-Time
                 (JIT) compilers that compile bytecode into native
                 processor instructions on the fly; direct compilers
                 that directly translate the Java source code into the
                 target processor's native language; and
                 bytecode-to-source translators that generate either
                 native code or an intermediate language, such as C,
                 from the bytecodes. Additional techniques, including
                 bytecode optimization, dynamic compilation, and
                 executing Java programs in parallel, attempt to improve
                 Java run-time performance while maintaining Java's
                 portability. Another alternative for executing Java
                 programs is a Java processor that implements the JVM
                 directly in hardware. In this survey, we discuss the
                 basis features, and the advantages and disadvantages,
                 of the various Java execution techniques. We also
                 discuss the various Java benchmarks that are being used
                 by the Java community for performance evaluation of the
                 different techniques. Finally, we conclude with a
                 comparison of the performance of the alternative Java
                 execution techniques based on reported results.",

                 programs by analyzing memory reference traces of
                 several SPECjvm98 applications running with a
                 Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. Trace information is
                 collected by an exception-based tracing tool called
                 JTRACE, without any instrumentation to the Java
                 programs or the JIT compiler.First, we find that the
                 overall cache miss ratio is increased due to garbage
                 collection, which suffers from higher cache misses
                 compared to the application. We also note that going
                 beyond 2-way cache associativity improves the cache
                 miss ratio marginally. Second, we observe that Java
                 programs generate a substantial amount of short-lived
                 objects. However, the size of frequently-referenced
                 long-lived objects is more important to the cache
                 performance, because it tends to determine the
                 application's working set size. Finally, we note that
                 the default heap configuration which starts from a
                 small initial heap size is very inefficient since it
                 invokes a garbage collector frequently. Although the
                 direct costs of garbage collection decrease as we
                 increase the available heap size, there exists an
                 optimal heap size which minimizes the total execution
                 time due to the interaction with the virtual memory
                 performance.",

                 performance for pointer-centric applications by up to
                 24% and reduces cache misses by up to 35%. This is
                 achieved by selecting an improved ordering for the data
                 members of pointer-based data structures. Our
                 optimization is applicable to all type-safe programming
                 languages that completely abstract from physical
                 storage layout; examples of such languages are Java and
                 Oberon. Our technique does not involve programmers in
                 the optimization process, but runs fully automatically,
                 guided by dynamic profiling information that captures
                 which paths through the program are taken with that
                 frequency. The algorithm first strives to cluster data
                 members that are accessed closely after one another
                 onto the same cache line, increasing spatial locality.
                 Then, the data members that have been mapped to a
                 particular cache line are ordered to minimize load
                 latency in case of a cache miss.",

                 implementation of orthogonal persistence for the Java
                 platform (OPJ). The PEVM is based on the Sun
                 Microsystems Laboratories Virtual Machine for Research
                 (ResearchVM), which features an optimizing Just-In-Time
                 compiler, exact generational garbage collection, and
                 fast thread synchronization. It also uses a new,
                 scalable persistent object store designed to manage
                 more than 80GB of objects. The PEVM is approximately
                 ten times faster than previous OPJ implementations and
                 can run significantly larger programs. It is faster
                 than or comparable in performance to several commercial
                 persistence solutions for the Java platform. Despite
                 the PEVM's speed and scalability, its implementation is
                 simpler than our previous OPJ implementation (e.g.,
                 just 43\% of the VM source patches needed by our
                 previous OPJ implementation). Its speed and simplicity
                 are largely due to our pointer swizzling strategy, the
                 ResearchVM's exact memory management, and a few simple
                 but effective mechanisms. For example, we implement
                 some key data structures in the Java programming
                 language since this automatically makes them
                 persistent.",

  abstract =     "Complete system simulation to understand the influence
                 of architecture and operating systems on application
                 execution has been identified to be crucial for systems
                 design. While there have been previous attempts at
                 understanding the architectural impact of Java
                 programs, there has been no prior work investigating
                 the operating system (kernel) activity during their
                 executions. This problem is particularly interesting in
                 the context of Java since it is not only the
                 application that can invoke kernel services, but so
                 does the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
                 implementation which runs these programs. Further, the
                 JVM style (JIT compiler or interpreter) and the manner
                 in which the different JVM components (such as the
                 garbage collector and class loader) are exercised, can
                 have a significant impact on the kernel activities.To
                 investigate these issues, this research uses complete
                 system simulation of the SPECjvm98 benchmarks on the
                 SimOS simulation platform. The execution of these
                 benchmarks on both JIT compilers and interpreters is
                 profiled in detail, to identify and quantify where time
                 is spent in each component. The kernel activity of
                 SPECjvm98 applications constitutes up to 17\% of the
                 execution time in the large dataset and up to 31\% in
                 the small dataset. The average kernel activity in the
                 large dataset is approximately 10\%, in comparison to
                 around 2\% in four SPECInt benchmarks studied. Of the
                 kernel services, TLB miss handling is the most dominant
                 in all applications. The TLB miss rates in the JIT
                 compiler, dynamic class loader and garbage collector
                 portions of the JVM are individually analyzed. In
                 addition to such execution profiles, the ILP in the
                 user and kernel mode are also quantified. The Java code
                 is seen to limit exploitable parallelism and aggressive
                 instruction issue is seen to be less efficient for
                 SPECjvm98 benchmarks in comparison to SPEC95 programs.
                 Also, the kernel mode of execution does not exhibit as
                 much ILP as the user mode.",

  abstract =     "Palm organizers are widely used in a multi-tasking
                 fashion. Users switch from one application to another
                 without losing the context established in either of
                 them. Despite its obvious usefulness, there is no
                 automatic support for this convenience in the
                 organizer's operating system, PalmOS. Programmers must
                 implement event callbacks that have to operate on a
                 PalmOS database API to save and reload specific
                 application state. In this report, we describe how this
                 burden can be eliminated. We enhanced the Spotless Java
                 virtual machine for the Palm organizer with transparent
                 multi-tasking support that automates persistence. As a
                 consequence, running Java programs can be beamed
                 between the infra-red links of two Palm organizers. A
                 beamed program will resume on the receiving organizer
                 in the exact same state as on the sending device. A
                 HotSync operation effectively establishes a checkpoint
                 for each involved Java program. The original Spotless
                 JVM's address range for running programs is limited to
                 a few tens of KB in the dynamic RAM area. By directly
                 addressing the much larger static RAM area, our
                 modified VM supports address ranges of several MB. We
                 provide an easy-to-use protocol that leverages
                 persistent threads for automatic life cycle control of
                 external resources (e.g., windows, forms and
                 databases). When applied at the library level, this
                 protocol maintains complete persistence transparency
                 for the application programmer.",

  abstract =     "Although there has been some experimentation with Java
                 as a language for numerically intensive computing,
                 there is a perception by many that the language is
                 unsuited for such work because of performance
                 deficiencies. In this article we show how optimizing
                 array bounds checks and null pointer checks creates
                 loop nests on which aggressive optimizations can be
                 used. Applying these optimizations by hand to a simple
                 matrix-multiply test case leads to Java-compliant
                 programs whose performance is in excess of 500 Mflops
                 on a four-processor 332MHz RS/6000 model F50 computer.
                 We also report in this article the effect that various
                 optimizations have on the performance of six
                 floating-point-intensive benchmarks. Through these
                 optimizations we have been able to achieve with Java at
                 least 80\% of the peak Fortran performance on the same
                 benchmarks. Since all of these optimizations can be
                 automated, we conclude that Java will soon be a serious
                 contender for numerically intensive computing.",

                 and integrity of data, because programs containing
                 untrusted code are the rule rather than the exception.
                 Information flow control allows the enforcement of
                 end-to-end security policies, but has been difficult to
                 put into practice. This article describes the
                 decentralized label model, a new label model for
                 control of information flow in systems with mutual
                 distrust and decentralized authority. The model
                 improves on existing multilevel security models by
                 allowing users to declassify information in a
                 decentralized way, and by improving support for
                 fine-grained data sharing. It supports static program
                 analysis of information flow, so that programs can be
                 certified to permit only acceptable information flows,

  abstract =     "Java bytecode verification forms the basis for
                 Java-based Internet security and needs a rigorous
                 description. One important aspect of bytecode
                 verification is to check if a Java Virtual Machine
                 (JVM) program is statically well-typed. So far, several
                 formal specifications have been proposed to define what
                 the static well-typedness means. This paper takes a
                 step further and presents a chaotic fixpoint iteration,
                 which represents a family of fixpoint computation
                 strategies to compute a least type for each JVM program
                 within a finite number of iteration steps. Since a
                 transfer function in the iteration is not monotone, we
                 choose to follow the example of a nonstandard fixpoint
                 theorem, which requires that all transfer functions are
                 increasing, and monotone in case the bigger element is
                 already a fixpoint. The resulting least type is the
                 artificial top element if and only if he JVM program is
                 not statically well-typed. The iteration is standard
                 and close to Sun's informal specification and most
                 commercial bytecode verifiers.",

  abstract =     "A new method is presented for analyzing and
                 reengineering class hierarchies. In our approach, a
                 class hierarchy is processed along with a set of
                 applications that use it, and a fine-grained analysis
                 of the access and subtype relationships between
                 objects, variables, and class members is performed. The
                 result of this analysis is again a class hierarchy,
                 which is guaranteed to be behaviorally equivalent to
                 the original hierarchy, but in which each object only
                 contains the members that are required. Our method is
                 semantically well-founded in {\em concept analysis\/}:
                 the new class hierarchy is a minimal and maximally
                 factorized {\em concept lattice\/} that reflects the
                 access and subtype relationships between variables,
                 objects and class members. The method is primarily
                 intended as a tool for finding imperfections in the
                 design of class hierarchies, and can be used as the
                 basis for tools that largely automate the process of
                 reengineering such hierarchies. The method can also be
                 used as a space-optimizing source-to-source
                 transformation that removes redundant fields from
                 objects. A prototype implementation for Java has been
                 constructed, and used to conduct several case studies.
                 Our results demonstrate that the method can provide
                 valuable insights into the usage of a class hierarchy
                 in a specific context, and lead to useful restructuring
                 proposals.",

                 confidence intervals; as more data are examined, the
                 answers and their corresponding running confidence
                 intervals are refined. In this paper, we extend this
                 approach to handle nested queries with aggregates
                 (i.e., at least one inner query block is an aggregate
                 query) by providing users with (approximate) answers
                 progressively as the inner aggregation query blocks are
                 evaluated. We address the new issues pose by nested
                 queries. In particular, the answer space begins with a
                 superset of the final answers and is refined as the
                 aggregates from the inner query blocks are refined. For
                 the intermediary answers to be meaningful, they have to
                 be interpreted with the aggregates from the inner
                 queries. We also propose a {\em multi-threaded model\/}
                 in evaluating such queries: each query block is
                 assigned to a thread, and the threads can be evaluated
                 concurrently and independently. The time slice across
                 the threads is {\em nondeterministic\/} in the sense
                 that the user controls the relative rate at which these
                 subqueries are being evaluated. For {\em enumerative\/}
                 nested queries, we propose a priority-based evaluation
                 strategy to present answers that are certainly in the
                 final answer space first, before presenting those whose
                 validity may be affected as the inner query aggregates
                 are refined. We implemented a prototype system using
                 Java and evaluated our system. Results for nested
                 queries with a level and multiple levels of nesting are
                 reported. Our results show the effectiveness of the
                 proposed mechanisms in providing progressive feedback
                 that reduces the initial waiting time of users
                 significantly without sacrificing the quality of the
                 answers.",

                 dangerous routine. Java systems have adopted a
                 technique called stack inspection to address this
                 concern. But its original definition, in terms of
                 searching stack frames, had an unclear relationship to
                 the actual achievement of security, overconstrained the
                 implementation of a Java system, limited many desirable
                 optimizations such as method inlining and tail
                 recursion, and generally interfered with
                 interprocedural optimization. We present a new
                 semantics for stack inspection based on a belief logic
                 and its implementation using the calculus of {\em
                 security-passing style\/} which addresses the concerns
                 of traditional stack inspection. With security-passing
                 style, we can efficiently represent the security
                 context for any method activation, and we can build a
                 new implementation strictly by rewriting the Java
                 bytecodes before they are loaded by the system. No
                 changes to the JVM or bytecode semantics are necessary.
                 With a combination of static analysis and runtime
                 optimizations, our prototype implementation shows
                 reasonable performance (although traditional stack
                 inspection is still faster), and is easier to consider
                 for languages beyond Java. We call our system SAFKASI
                 (the Security Architecture Formerly Known as Stack
                 Inspection).",

  abstract =     "Extensible systems, such as Java or the SPIN
                 extensible operating system, allow for units of code,
                 or extensions, to be added to a running system in
                 almost arbitrary fashion. Extensions closely interact
                 through low-latency but type-safe interfaces to form a
                 tightly integrated system. As extensions can come from
                 arbitrary sources, not all of whom can be trusted to
                 conform to an organization's security policy, such
                 structuring raises the question of how security
                 constraints are enforced in an extensible system. In
                 this paper, we present an access control mechanism for
                 extensible systems to address this problem. Our access
                 control mechanism decomposes access control into a
                 policy-neutral enforcement manager and a security
                 policy manager, and it is transparent to extensions in
                 the absence of security violations. It structures the
                 system into protection domains, enforces protection
                 domains through access control checks, and performs
                 auditing of system operations. The access control
                 mechanism works by inspecting extensions for their
                 types and operations to determine which abstractions
                 require protection and by redirecting procedure or
                 method invocations to inject access control operations
                 into the system. We describe the design of this access
                 control mechanism, present an implementation within the
                 SPIN extensible operating systems, and provide a
                 qualitative as well as quantitative evaluation of the
                 mechanism.",

  abstract =     "Since the advent of high-performance
                 distributed-memory parallel computing, the need for
                 intelligible code has become ever greater. The
                 development and maintenance of libraries for these
                 architectures is simply too complex to be amenable to
                 conventional approaches to implementation. Attempts to
                 employ traditional methodology have led, in our
                 opinion, to the production of an abundance of
                 anfractuous code that is difficult to maintain and
                 almost impossible to upgrade.Having struggled with
                 these issues for more than a decade, we have concluded
                 that a solution is to apply a technique from
                 theoretical computer science, formal derivation, to the
                 development of high-performance linear algebra
                 libraries. We think the resulting approach results in
                 aesthetically pleasing, coherent code that greatly
                 facilitates intelligent modularity and high performance
                 while enhancing confidence in its correctness. Since
                 the technique is language-independent, it lends itself
                 equally well to a wide spectrum of programming
                 languages (and paradigms) ranging from C and Fortran to
                 C++ and Java. In this paper, we illustrate our
                 observations by looking at the Formal Linear Algebra
                 Methods Environment (FLAME), a framework that
                 facilitates the derivation and implementation of linear
                 algebra algorithms on sequential architectures. This
                 environment demonstrates that lessons learned in the
                 distributed-memory world can guide us toward better
                 approaches even in the sequential world. We present
                 performance experiments on the Intel (R) Pentium (R)
                 III processor that demonstrate that high performance
                 can be attained by coding at a high level of
                 abstraction.",

                 quantitative performance models of computer systems are
                 usually obtained by performing a series of arithmetical
                 operations on the input parameters of the model.
                 However, especially during early phases of system
                 design and implementation, not all the parameter values
                 are usually known exactly. In related research
                 contributions, intervals have been proposed as a means
                 to capture parameter uncertainties. Furthermore,
                 methods to adapt existing solution algorithms to
                 parameter intervals have been discussed. In this paper
                 we present the adaptation of an existing performance
                 model to parameter intervals. The approximate solution
                 of a queueing network modelling an Enterprise JavaBeans
                 server implementation is adapted to interval arithmetic
                 in order to represent the uncertainty in some of the
                 parameters of the model. A new interval splitting
                 method is applied to obtain reasonable tight
                 performance measure intervals. Monotonicity properties
                 of intermediate computation results are exploited to
                 achieve a more efficient interval solution. In
                 addition, parts of the original solution algorithm are
                 modified to increase the efficiency of the
                 corresponding interval arithmetical solution.",

                 recognizes a musical tune whistled by the user, finds
                 it in a database, and returns its name, composer, and
                 other information. Such a service is useful for track
                 retrieval at radio stations, music stores, etc., and is
                 also a step toward the long-term goal of communicating
                 with a computer much like one would with a human being.
                 Tuneserver is implemented as a public Java-based WWW
                 service with a database of approximately 10,000 motifs.
                 Tune recognition is based on a highly error-resistant
                 encoding, proposed by Parsons, that uses only the
                 direction of the melody, ignoring the size of intervals
                 as well as rhythm. We present the design and
                 implementation of the tune recognition core, outline
                 the design of the Web service, and describe the results
                 obtained in an empirical evaluation of the new
                 interface, including the derivation of suitable system
                 parameters, resulting performance figures, and an error

  abstract =     "The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the cornerstone of
                 Java technology and its efficiency in executing the
                 portable Java bytecodes is crucial for the success of
                 this technology. Interpretation, Just-in-Time (JIT)
                 compilation, and hardware realization are well-known
                 solutions for a JVM and previous research has proposed
                 optimizations for each of these techniques. However,
                 each technique has its pros and cons and may not be
                 uniformly attractive for all hardware platforms.
                 Instead, an understanding of the architectural
                 implications of JVM implementations with real
                 applications can be crucial to the development of
                 enabling technologies for efficient Java runtime system
                 development on a wide range of platforms. Toward this
                 goal, this paper examines architectural issues from
                 both the hardware and JVM implementation perspectives.
                 The paper starts by identifying the important execution
                 characteristics of Java applications from a bytecode
                 perspective. It then explores the potential of a smart
                 JIT compiler strategy that can dynamically interpret or
                 compile based on associated costs and investigates the
                 CPU and cache architectural support that would benefit
                 JVM implementations. We also study the available
                 parallelism during the different execution modes using
                 applications from the SPECjvm98 benchmarks. At the
                 bytecode level, it is observed that less than 5 out of
                 the 256 bytecodes constitute 90 percent of the dynamic
                 bytecode stream. Method sizes fall into a trinodal
                 distribution with peak of 1, 9, and 26 bytecodes across
                 all benchmarks. The architectural issues explored in
                 this study show that, when Java applications are
                 executed with a JIT compiler, selective translation
                 using good heuristics can improve performance, but the
                 saving is only 10-15 percent at best. The instruction
                 and data cache performance of Java applications are
                 seen to be better than that of C/C++ applications
                 except in the case of data cache performance in the JIT
                 mode. Write misses resulting from installation of JIT
                 compiler output dominate the misses and deteriorate the
                 data cache performance in JIT mode. A study on the
                 available parallelism shows that Java programs executed
                 using JIT compilers have parallelism comparable to
                 C/C++ programs for small window sizes, but falls behind
                 when the window size is increased. Java programs
                 executed using the interpreter have very little
                 parallelism due to the stack nature of the SVM
                 instruction set, which is dominant in the interpreted
                 execution mode. In addition, this work gives revealing
                 insights and architectural proposals for designing an
                 efficient Java runtime system.",

  abstract =     "Advanced e-services require efficient, flexible, and
                 easy-to-use workflow technology that integrates well
                 with mainstream Internet technologies such as XML and
                 Web servers. This paper discusses an XML-enabled
                 architecture for distributed workflow management that
                 is implemented in the latest version of our Mentor-lite
                 prototype system. The key asset of this architecture is
                 an XML mediator that handles the exchange of business
                 and flow control data between workflow and
                 business-object servers on the one hand and client
                 activities on the other via XML messages over http. Our
                 implementation of the mediator has made use of Oracle's
                 XSQL servlet. The major benefit of the advocated
                 architecture is that it provides seamless integration
                 of client applications into e-service workflows with
                 scalable efficiency and very little explicit coding, in
                 contrast to an earlier, Java-based, version of our
                 Mentor-lite prototype that required much more code and
                 exhibited potential performance problems.",

                 Java workloads used in benchmarking Java Virtual
                 Machines (JVMs), based on instrumentation of both
                 application and library code in a state-of-the-art JVM,
                 and provides structured information about these
                 workloads to help guide systems' design. We begin by
                 characterizing the inherent memory behavior of the
                 benchmarks, such as information on the breakup of heap
                 accesses among different categories and on the hotness
                 of references to fields and methods. We then provide
                 detailed information about misses in the data TLB and
                 caches, including the distribution of misses over
                 different kinds of accesses and over different methods.
                 In the process, we make interesting discoveries about
                 TLB behavior and limitations of data prefetching
                 schemes discussed in the literature in dealing with
                 pointer-intensive Java codes. Throughout this paper, we
                 develop a set of recommendations to computer architects
                 and compiler writers on how to optimize computer
                 systems and system software to run Java programs more
                 efficiently. This paper also makes the first attempt to
                 compare the characteristics of SPECjvm98 to those of a
                 server-oriented benchmark, pBOB, and explain why the
                 current set of SPECjvm98 benchmarks may not be adequate
                 for a comprehensive and objective evaluation of JVMs
                 and just-in-time (JIT) compilers.We discover that the
                 fraction of accesses to array elements is quite
                 significant, demonstrate that the number of ``hot
                 spots'' in the benchmarks is small, and show that field
                 reordering cannot yield significant performance gains.
                 We also show that even a fairly large L2 data cache is
                 not effective for many Java benchmarks. We observe that
                 instructions used to prefetch data into the L2 data
                 cache are often squashed because of high TLB miss rates
                 and because the TLB does not usually have the
                 translation information needed to prefetch the data
                 into the L2 data cache. We also find that co-allocation
                 of frequently used method tables can reduce the number
                 of TLB misses and lower the cost of accessing type
                 information block entries in virtual method calls and
                 runtime type checking.",

  abstract =     "The Internet has allowed the creation of huge amounts
                 of data located on many sites. Performing complex
                 operations on some data requires that the data be
                 transferred first to the machine on which the
                 operations are to be executed, which may require a
                 non-negligible amount of bandwidth and may seriously
                 limit performance if it is the bottleneck. However,
                 instead of moving the data to the code, it is possible
                 to move the code to the data, and perform all the
                 operations locally. This simple idea has led to a new
                 paradigm called {\em code-mobility:\/} a mobile object
                 --- sometimes called an agent --- is given a list of
                 destinations and a series of operations to perform on
                 each one of them. The agent will visit all of the
                 destinations, perform the requested operations and
                 possibly pass the result on to another object. Any
                 mobility mechanism must first provide a way to migrate
                 code from one host to another. It must also ensure that
                 any communication following a migration will not be
                 impaired by it, namely that two objects should still be
                 able to communicate even if one of them has migrated.
                 Such a mechanism is referred to as a {\em location\/}
                 mechanism since it often relies on the knowledge of the
                 location of the objects to ensure communications. Two
                 location mechanisms are widely used: the first one uses
                 a centralized server whereas the second one relies on
                 special objects called {\em forwarders.\/} This paper
                 evaluates and compares the performance of an existing
                 implementation of these approaches in terms of cost of
                 communication in presence of migration. Based on a
                 Markov chain analysis, we will construct and solve two
                 mathematical models, one for each mechanism and will
                 use them to evaluate the cost of location. For the
                 purpose of validation, we have developed for each
                 mechanism a benchmark that uses {\em ProActive\/} [2],
                 a Java library that provides all the necessary
                 primitives for code mobility. Experiments conducted on
                 a LAN and on a MAN have validated both models and have
                 shown that the location server always performs better
                 than the forwarders. Using our analytical models we
                 will nevertheless identify situations where the
                 opposite conclusion holds. However, under most
                 operational conditions location servers will perform
                 better than forwarders.",

                 and the WebSphere Administration Console, all in the
                 context of building and running the example programs
                 for O'Reilly's Enterprise JavaBeans, 3rd edition. The
                 Workbook guides developers step-by-step, explaining how
                 to build and deploy working solutions in a particular
                 application server, and provides useful hints, tips and
                 warnings.\par

                 This WebSphere 4.0 AEs Workbook was originally
                 published by Enterprise JavaBeans author Richard
                 Monson-Haefel's Titan Books publishing company.
                 O'Reilly thought so highly of it, we acquired the
                 rights to publish it ourselves, in order to give more
                 developers access to this critical information.",

                 really figuring out how to use it to its fullest
                 potential. He calls the books, ``the culmination of

  abstract =     "Grid systems span manifold organizations and
                 application domains. Because this diverse environment
                 inevitably engenders multiple protocols,
                 interoperability mechanisms are crucial to seamless,
                 pervasive access. This paper presents the design,
                 rationale, and implementation of the Proteus
                 multiprotocol library for integrating multiple message
                 protocols, such as SOAP and JMS, within one system.
                 Proteus decouples application code from protocol code
                 at run-time, allowing clients to incorporate separately
                 developed protocols without recompiling or halting.
                 Through generic serialization, which separates the
                 transfer syntax from the message type, protocols can
                 also be added independently of serialization routines.
                 We also show performance-enhancing mechanisms for Grid
                 services that examine metadata, but pass actual data
                 through opaquely (such as adapters). The interface
                 provided to protocol implementors is general enough to
                 support protocols as disparate as our current
                 implementations: SOAP, JMS, and binary. Proteus is
                 written in C++; a Java port is planned.",

                 number of programs in object-oriented languages such as
                 Java that require garbage collection (GC). To explore
                 the design and evaluation of GC algorithms quickly,
                 researchers are using simulation based on traces of
                 object allocation and lifetime behavior. The {\em brute
                 force\/} method generates perfect traces using a
                 whole-heap GC at every potential GC point in the
                 program. Because this process is prohibitively
                 expensive, researchers often use {\em granulated\/}
                 traces by collecting only periodically, e.g., every 32K
                 bytes of allocation. We extend the state of the art for
                 simulating GC algorithms in two ways. First, we present
                 a systematic methodology and results on the effects of
                 trace granularity for a variety of copying GC
                 algorithms. We show that trace granularity often
                 distorts GC performance results compared with perfect
                 traces, and that some GC algorithms are more sensitive
                 to this effect than others. Second, we introduce and
                 measure the performance of a new precise algorithm for
                 generating GC traces which is over 800 times faster
                 than the brute force method. Our algorithm, called
                 Merlin, frequently timestamps objects and later uses
                 the timestamps of dead objects to reconstruct precisely
                 when they died. It performs only periodic garbage
                 collections and achieves high accuracy at low cost,
                 eliminating any reason to use granulated traces.",

                 may greatly improve performance. We exploit this in a
                 compiler for Titanium, a dialect of Java. Our compiler
                 combines reordering optimizations such as loop fusion
                 and tiling with storage optimizations such as array
                 contraction (eliminating or reducing the size of
                 temporary arrays). The programmers we have in mind are
                 willing to spend some time tuning their code and their
                 compiler parameters. Given that, and the difficulty in
                 statically selecting parameters such as tile sizes, it
                 makes sense to provide automatic parameter searching
                 alongside the compiler. Our strategy is to optimize
                 aggressively but to expose the compiler's decisions to
                 external control. We double or triple the performance
                 of Gauss--Seidel relaxation and multigrid (versus an
                 optimizing compiler without tiling and array
                 contraction), and we argue that ours is the best

                 Java programs by analyzing memory reference traces of
                 the SPECjvm98 applications executed by the Latte Java
                 virtual machine. We study in detail Java programs'
                 cache performance of different access types in three
                 JVM phases, under two execution modes, using three
                 cache configurations and two application data sets. We
                 observe that the poor data cache performance in the JIT
                 execution mode is caused by code installation, when the
                 data write miss rate in the execution engine can be as
                 high as 70\%. In addition, code installation also
                 deteriorates instruction cache performance during
                 execution of translated code. High cache miss rate in
                 garbage collection is mainly caused by large working
                 set and pointer chasing of the garbage collector. A
                 larger data cache works better on eliminating data
                 cache read misses than write misses, and is more
                 efficient on improving cache performance in the
                 execution engine than in the garbage collection. As
                 application data set increases in the JIT execution
                 mode, instruction cache and data cache write miss rates
                 of the execution engine decrease, while data cache read
                 miss rate of the execution engine increases. On the
                 other hand, impact of varying data set on cache
                 performance is not as pronounced in the interpreted
                 mode as in the JIT mode.",

                 A BigDecimal consists of an arbitrary precision integer
                 unscaled value and a non-negative 32-bit integer scale,
                 which represents the number of digits to the right of

                 the XML-RPC system for remote method invocation. We
                 developed a program that can use either XML-RPC-based
                 network communication or a hand-rolled version of
                 networking code based on the java.net package. We first
                 compare our two implementations using traditional
                 object-oriented metrics. In addition, we conduct tests
                 over a local network and the Internet to assess the
                 performance of the two versions of the networking code
                 using traditional internetworking metrics. We find that
                 XML-RPC reduces the programming complexity of the
                 software by roughly 50\% (across various metrics). On
                 the other hand, the hand-rolled java.net-based
                 implementation offers up to an order of magnitude
                 better network performance in some of our tests.",

                 benchmark, has attracted a large number of results
                 submissions and their subsequent publication. However,
                 ECperf places little restriction on the hardware
                 platform, operating systems and databases utilized in
                 the benchmarking process. This, combined with the
                 existence of only two primary metrics, makes it
                 difficult to accurately compare the results, or the
                 performance of the Application Server products
                 themselves. By mining the full-disclosure archives for
                 trends and correlations we have discovered that J2EE
                 technology is very scalable with increasing middle-tier
                 resources, as long as the database has sufficient
                 resources to prevent it becoming a bottleneck. Other
                 observed trends include, a linear correlation between
                 middle-tier total processing power and throughput, as
                 well as between J2EE Application Server license costs
                 and throughput. However, the results clearly indicate
                 that there is an increasing cost per user with
                 increasing capacity systems. Finally, the correlation
                 between middle-tier processing power and throughput,
                 combined with results obtained from a different
                 `lighter-weight' benchmark, facilitates an estimate of
                 throughput for different types of J2EE applications.",

  abstract =     "The National Ignition Facility (NIF) currently under
                 construction at the University of California Lawrence
                 Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is a 192-beam,
                 1.8-Megajoule, 500-Terawatt laser being built by the
                 Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security
                 Agency (NNSA) for inertial confinement fusion and
                 high-energy-density experimental studies. The
                 stadium-sized facility is currently activating systems
                 for first light and will be completed in 2008.The
                 facility is controlled by the Integrated Computer
                 Control System (ICCS), a layered architecture of 300
                 front-end processors (FEP) coordinated by supervisor
                 subsystems. The FEP's are distributed computers that
                 interface to physical devices through VME-bus and
                 PCI-bus crates. The functional subsystems - beam
                 control including automatic beam alignment and
                 wavefront correction, laser pulse generation and
                 pre-amplification, diagnostics, pulse power, and shot
                 timing - implement the actions of operators at eight
                 graphic consoles, coordinate control, and display and
                 archive data in a database. The software architecture
                 mimics the hardware design levels: software devices in
                 FEP's model hardware control points and supervisory
                 objects model the line replaceable units that
                 modularize the laser system. Graphic user interfaces
                 are provided to make status and control of each level
                 accessible to operators. The ICCS software is based on
                 an object-oriented framework that incorporates services
                 for archiving, machine configuration, graphical user
                 interface, status monitoring, event logging, scripting,
                 alert management, and access control. Software code
                 development uses a mixed language environment of Ada
                 (for functional controls) and Java (for user interface
                 and database backend). CORBA is used to communicate
                 between languages and processors. Substantial benefits
                 credited to using Ada include the formality of
                 controlled interfaces that rely on Ada's type model,
                 easy-to-construct exception processing and the
                 robustness of Ada's tasks. A strategy of incremental
                 cycles of construction and formal test has been used
                 since project inception. The project has completed more
                 than 30 planned cycles of deployment into testbeds and
                 is now integrating with the first 4 operational
                 beamlines in the facility. Fifty of the planned 300
                 FEP's have been installed and tested with facility
                 equipment. These implement nearly 200 classes that
                 model physical control hardware - some 2500 software
                 objects. Nearly all of the top-level functional
                 subsystems, embodying some 110 application classes,
                 have been commissioned in the facility. The integrated
                 control system has successfully executed shots into
                 test diagnostics in support of laser integration. The
                 first coordinated facility shots to the 10-m diameter
                 target chamber are expected in early 2003.Issues of
                 robustness and scaling arise as the system integrates
                 larger ensembles of control points and serves an
                 increasing number of operators. The system comprises
                 some 60 intercommunicating processes, and since none of
                 these are known to be defect free, techniques for
                 replacement and restart of individual processes are
                 required. The most common communication pattern -
                 publish and subscribe - is supported by a connection
                 management framework that adds exception handlers to
                 the ORB in order to restore broken connections and
                 restart failed processes without explicit action by
                 application client codes. This work was performed under
                 the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by the
                 University of California, Lawrence Livermore National
                 Laboratory under Contract No. W-7405-Eng-48.",

  abstract =     "The emergence of grid and a new class of data-driven
                 applications is making a new form of parallelism
                 desirable, which we refer to as coarse-grained
                 pipelined parallelism. This paper reports on a
                 compilation system developed to exploit this form of
                 parallelism. We use a dialect of Java that exposes both
                 pipelined and data parallelism to the compiler. Our
                 compiler is responsible for selecting a set of
                 candidate filter boundaries, determining the volume of
                 communication required if a particular boundary is
                 chosen, performing the decomposition, and generating
                 code. We have developed a one-pass algorithm for
                 determining the required communication between
                 consecutive filters. We have developed a cost model for
                 estimating the execution time for a given
                 decomposition, and a dynamic programming algorithm for
                 performing the decomposition. Detailed evaluation of
                 our current compiler using four data-driven
                 applications demonstrate the feasibility of our
                 approach.",

                 algorithm for a Java Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which
                 integrates register minimization into list scheduling.
                 We use backtracking in the list scheduling when we have
                 used up all the available registers. To reduce the
                 overhead of backtracking, we incrementally maintain a
                 set of candidate instructions for undoing scheduling.
                 To maximize the ILP after undoing scheduling. To
                 maximize the ILP after undoing scheduling, we select an
                 instruction chain with the smallest increase in the
                 total execution time. We implemented our new algorithm
                 in a production-level Java JIT compiler for the Intel
                 Itanium processor. The experiment showed that, compared
                 to the best known algorithm by Govindarajan et al., our
                 IPS algorithm improved the performance by up to +1.8\%
                 while it reduced the compilation time for IPS by 58\%
                 on average.",

                 patterns in C programs often constrains compiler alias
                 analysis to yield conservative register allocation and
                 promotion. Speculative register promotion with hardware
                 support has the potential to more aggressively promote
                 memory references into registers in the presence of
                 aliases. This paper studies the use of the Advanced
                 Load Address Table (ALAT), a data speculation feature
                 defined in the IA-64 architecture, for speculative
                 register promotion. An algorithm for speculative
                 register promotion based on partial redundancy
                 elimination is presented. The algorithm is implemented
                 in Intel?s Open Research Compiler (ORC). Experiments on
                 SPEC CPU2000 benchmark programs are conducted to show
                 that speculative register promotion can improve
                 performance of some benchmarks by 1\% to 7\%.",

                 language for the postprocessing of Chebyshev
                 approximations to discontinuous functions is presented.
                 It is demonstrated how to use the package to remove the
                 effects of the Gibbs--Wilbraham phenomenon from
                 Chebyshev approximations of discontinuous functions.
                 Additionally, the package is used to postprocess
                 Chebyshev collocation and Chebyshev super spectral
                 viscosity approximations of hyperbolic partial
                 differential equations. The postprocessing method is
                 the Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure. The Spectral
                 Signal Processing Suite is the first publicly available
                 package that implements the procedure. State-of-the-art
                 techniques are used to implement the algorithms with
                 efficiency while reducing round-off error.",

                 `on the fly' when user requests are received. In this
                 paper, we experimentally evaluate the impact of three
                 different dynamic content technologies (Perl, PHP, and
                 Java) on Web server performance. We quantify achievable
                 performance first for static content serving, and then
                 for dynamic content generation, considering cases both
                 with and without database access. The results show that
                 the overheads of dynamic content generation reduce the
                 peak request rate supported by a Web server up to a
                 factor of 8, depending on the workload characteristics
                 and the technologies used. In general, our results show
                 that Java server technologies typically outperform both
                 Perl and PHP for dynamic content generation, though
                 performance under overload conditions can be erratic
                 for some implementations.",

                 Instrumentation separates collector and program
                 behavior, and performance counters measure timing and
                 memory behavior on three architectures. Our
                 experimental design reveals key algorithmic features
                 and how they match program characteristics to explain
                 the direct and indirect costs of garbage collection as
                 a function of heap size on the SPEC JVM benchmarks. For
                 example, we find that the contiguous allocation of
                 copying collectors attains significant locality
                 benefits over free-list allocators. The reduced
                 collection costs of the generational algorithms
                 together with the locality benefit of contiguous
                 allocation motivates a copying {\em nursery\/} for
                 newly allocated objects. These benefits dominate the
                 overheads of generational collectors compared with
                 non-generational and no collection, disputing the myth
                 that `no garbage collection is good garbage
                 collection.' Performance is less sensitive to the
                 mature space collection algorithm in our benchmarks.
                 However the locality and pointer mutation
                 characteristics for a given program occasionally prefer
                 copying or mark-sweep. This study is unique in its
                 breadth of garbage collection algorithms and its depth
                 of analysis.",

  abstract =     "It is a major challenge for a Java JIT compiler to
                 perform single-precision floating-point operations
                 efficiently for the x86 processors. In previous
                 research, the double-precision mode is set as the
                 default precision mode when methods are invoked.
                 Sophisticated approaches then use heuristic approaches
                 to optimization by considering the trade-offs between
                 roundings and mode switches. However, this convention
                 introduces redundant mode switches across method
                 boundaries. Furthermore, methods that include both
                 single- and double-precision operations cannot switch
                 the mode, even if single-precision operations are
                 dominant. We propose a new approach to these problems.
                 We eliminate redundant mode switches by ignoring the
                 default precision mode and calling a method in the same
                 precision mode as the caller. For methods that include
                 both single- and double-precision methods, we reduce
                 the overhead of rounding by isolating code segments of
                 a given method that should be executed in the
                 single-precision mode. We implemented our approach in
                 IBM's Just-in-Time compiler, and obtained experimental
                 results demonstrating that, in SPECjvm98, it
                 consistently shows the best performance in any
                 configuration of benchmark programs, inline policies,
                 and processor architectures compared with previous
                 research approaches.",

  abstract =     "An overview is presented of object-based and
                 image-based representations of objects by their
                 interiors. The representations are distinguished by the
                 manner in which they can be used to answer two
                 fundamental queries in database applications: (1)
                 Feature query: given an object, determine its
                 constituent cells (i.e., their locations in space). (2)
                 Location query: given a cell (i.e., a location in
                 space), determine the identity of the object (or
                 objects) of which it is a member as well as the
                 remaining constituent cells of the object (or objects).
                 Regardless of the representation that is used, the
                 generation of responses to the feature and location
                 queries is facilitated by building an index (i.e., the
                 result of a sort) either on the objects or on their
                 locations in space, and implementing it using an access
                 structure that correlates the objects with the
                 locations. Assuming the presence of an access
                 structure, implicit (i.e., image-based) representations
                 are described that are good for finding the objects
                 associated with a particular location or cell (i.e.,
                 the location query), while requiring that all cells be
                 examined when determining the locations associated with
                 a particular object (i.e., the feature query). In
                 contrast, explicit (i.e., object-based) representations
                 are good for the feature query, while requiring that
                 all objects be examined when trying to respond to the
                 location query. The goal is to be able to answer both
                 types of queries with one representation and without
                 possibly having to examine every cell. Representations
                 are presented that achieve this goal by imposing
                 containment hierarchies on either space (i.e., the
                 cells in the space in which the objects are found), or
                 objects. In the former case, space is aggregated into
                 successively larger-sized chunks (i.e., blocks), while
                 in the latter, objects are aggregated into successively
                 larger groups (in terms of the number of objects that
                 they contain). The former is applicable to image-based
                 interior-based representations of which the space
                 pyramid is an example. The latter is applicable to
                 object-based interior-based representations of which
                 the R-tree is an example. The actual mechanics of many
                 of these representations are demonstrated in the VASCO
                 JAVA applets found at
                 \url{http://www.cs.umd.edu/{\SGMLtilde}hjs/quadtree/index.html}.",

  abstract =     "The Progressive Deployment System (PDS) is a virtual
                 execution environment and infrastructure designed
                 specifically for deploying software, or ``assets'', on
                 demand while enabling management from a central
                 location. PDS intercepts a select subset of system
                 calls on the target machine to provide a partial
                 virtualization at the operating system level. This
                 enables an asset's install-time environment to be
                 reproduced virtually while otherwise not isolating the
                 asset from peer applications on the target machine.
                 Asset components, or ``shards'', are fetched as they
                 are needed (or they may be pre-fetched), enabling the
                 asset to be progressively deployed by overlapping
                 deployment with execution. Cryptographic digests are
                 used to eliminate redundant shards within and among
                 assets, which enables more efficient deployment. A
                 framework is provided for intercepting interfaces above
                 the operating system (e.g., Java class loading),
                 enabling optimizations requiring semantic awareness not
                 present at the OS level. The paper presents the design
                 of PDS, motivates its ``porous isolation model'' with
                 respect to the challenges of software deployment, and
                 presents measurements of PDS's execution
                 characteristics.",

  abstract =     "Multithreaded applications with multigigabyte heaps
                 running on modern servers provide new challenges for
                 garbage collection (GC). The challenges for
                 ``server-oriented'' GC include: ensuring short pause
                 times on a multigigabyte heap while minimizing
                 throughput penalty, good scaling on multiprocessor
                 hardware, and keeping the number of expensive
                 multicycle fence instructions required by weak ordering
                 to a minimum. We designed and implemented a collector
                 facing these demands building on the mostly concurrent
                 garbage collector proposed by Boehm et al. [1991]. Our
                 collector incorporates new ideas into the original
                 collector. We make it parallel and incremental; we
                 employ concurrent low-priority background GC threads to
                 take advantage of processor idle time; we propose novel
                 algorithmic improvements to the basic mostly concurrent
                 algorithm improving its efficiency and shortening its
                 pause times; and finally, we use advanced techniques,
                 such as a low-overhead work packet mechanism to enable
                 full parallelism among the incremental and concurrent
                 collecting threads and ensure load balancing. We
                 compared the new collector to the mature,
                 well-optimized, parallel, stop-the-world mark-sweep
                 collector already in the IBM JVM. When allowed to run
                 aggressively, using 72\% of the CPU utilization during
                 a short concurrent phase, our collector prototype
                 reduces the maximum pause time from 161 ms to 46 ms
                 while only losing 11.5\% throughput when running the
                 SPECjbb2000 benchmark on a 600-MB heap on an 8-way
                 PowerPC 1.1-GHz processors. When the collector is
                 limited to a nonintrusive operation using only 29\% of
                 the CPU utilization, the maximum pause time obtained is
                 79 ms and the loss in throughput is 15.4\%.",

  abstract =     "An implicit (automatic) signal monitor uses a
                 waituntil predicate statement to construct
                 synchronization, as opposed to an explicit-signal
                 monitor using condition variables and signal/wait
                 statements for synchronization. Of the two
                 synchronization approaches, the implicit-signal monitor
                 is often easier to use and prove correct, but has an
                 inherently high execution cost. Hence, its primary use
                 is for prototyping concurrent systems using monitors,
                 where speed and accuracy of software development
                 override execution performance. After a concurrent
                 system is working, any implicit-signal monitor that is
                 a performance bottleneck can be converted to an
                 explicit-signal monitor. Unfortunately, many
                 monitor-based concurrency systems provide only
                 explicit-signal monitors, precluding the design
                 benefits of implicit-signal monitors. This article
                 presents a historical look at the development of the
                 implicit-signal monitor in relation to its counterpart
                 the explicit-signal monitor. An analysis of the
                 different kinds of implicit-signal monitors shows the
                 effects certain design decisions have on the problems
                 that can be solved and the performance of the
                 solutions. Finally, an extensive discussion is
                 presented on simulating an implicit-signal monitor via
                 different explicit-signal monitors. These simulations
                 are reasonably complex, depending on the kind of
                 explicit-signal monitor available for the simulation
                 and the desired semantics required for the
                 implicit-signal monitor. Interestingly, the complexity
                 of the simulations also illustrates certain
                 deficiencies with explicit-signal monitors, which are
                 discussed in detail. Performance comparisons are made
                 among the different simulations with monitors from the
                 concurrent systems PThreads, Java, and $\mu$C++.",

                 automatic theorem prover Simplify, which is the proof
                 engine of the Extended Static Checkers ESC/Java and
                 ESC/Modula-3. Simplify uses the Nelson--Oppen method to
                 combine decision procedures for several important
                 theories, and also employs a matcher to reason about
                 quantifiers. Instead of conventional matching in a term
                 DAG, Simplify matches up to equivalence in an E-graph,
                 which detects many relevant pattern instances that
                 would be missed by the conventional approach. The
                 article describes two techniques, error context
                 reporting and error localization, for helping the user
                 to determine the reason that a false conjecture is
                 false. The article includes detailed performance
                 figures on conjectures derived from realistic

  abstract =     "Many applications rely upon a tuple space within
                 distributed system middleware to provide loosely
                 coupled communication and service coordination. This
                 paper describes an approach for measuring the
                 throughput and response time of a tuple space when it
                 handles concurrent local space interactions.
                 Furthermore, it discusses a technique that populates a
                 tuple space with tuples before the execution of a
                 benchmark in order to age the tuple space and provide a
                 worst-case measurement of space performance. We apply
                 the tuple space benchmarking and aging methods to the
                 measurement of the performance of a JavaSpace, a
                 current example of a tuple space that integrates with
                 the Jini network technology. The experiment results
                 indicate that: (i) the JavaSpace exhibits limited
                 scalability as the number of concurrent interactions
                 from local space clients increases, (ii) the aging
                 technique can operate with acceptable time overhead,
                 and (iii) the aging technique does ensure that the
                 results from benchmarking capture the worst-case
                 performance of a tuple space.",

  abstract =     "The Java RMI collector is arguably the most widely
                 used distributed garbage collector. Its distributed
                 reference listing algorithm was introduced by Birrell
                 et al. in the context of Network Objects, where the
                 description was informal and heavily biased toward
                 implementation. In this article, we formalize this
                 algorithm in an implementation-independent manner,
                 which allows us to clarify weaknesses of the initial
                 presentation. In particular, we discover cases critical
                 to the correctness of the algorithm that were not
                 accounted for by Birrell. We use our formalization to
                 derive an invariant-based proof of correctness of the
                 algorithm that avoids notoriously difficult temporal
                 reasoning. Furthermore, we offer a novel graphical
                 representation of the state transition diagram, which
                 we use to provide intuitive explanations of the
                 algorithm and to investigate its tolerance to faults in
                 a systematic manner. Finally, we examine how the
                 algorithm may be optimized, either by placing
                 constraints on message channels or by tightening the
                 coupling between the application program and
                 distributed garbage collector.",

                 implementation and empirical evaluation of these
                 algorithms with respect to a set of properties such as
                 bit-rate, stealth, and resilience to attack. We
                 demonstrate through the use of the SANDMARK framework
                 that both of these algorithms have a high bit-rate but
                 are unstealthy and easy to attack.",

                 PageRank and similar fast-converging recursive graph

                 By combining a fast Java-based PageRank implementation
                 with a Prolog base inferential layer, running on top of
                 an optimized WordNet graph, we describe applications to

  abstract =     "In name and in practice, the World-Wide Web (hereafter
                 Web) is used around the World beyond English-speaking
                 areas. This creates a tremendous need to
                 internationalize standard terminology used in the
                 technologies that make the Web possible. Existing
                 efforts on XML internationalization (i18n) and
                 localization (i10n) have focused on the content of XML
                 documents instead of the terms used in markup
                 (annotations) such as elements and attributes. The SGML
                 standard ISO 8879 supports the use of Unicode (ISO
                 10646) throughout a document, including markups.
                 However, most elements and attributes of XML documents
                 are still defined in English, thereby limiting their
                 use among non-English speakers. This paper presents an
                 XSLT-based method that can completely localize the
                 markup of XML documents into different natural
                 languages. We also describe how the proposed technique
                 can be applied to translation problems in programming
                 (e.g. C and Java) or documentation (e.g. \LaTeX{} or
                 other formatting languages) so that a program or a
                 document can be converted to and from an XML format",

                 for multithreaded shared-memory programs, focusing on
                 the Java programming language. The analysis is based on
                 a type system that captures many common synchronization
                 patterns. It supports classes with internal
                 synchronization, classes that require client-side
                 synchronization, and thread-local classes. In order to
                 demonstrate the effectiveness of the type system, we
                 have implemented it in a checker and applied it to over
                 40,000 lines of hand-annotated Java code. We found a
                 number of race conditions in the standard Java
                 libraries and other test programs. The checker required
                 fewer than 20 additional type annotations per 1,000
                 lines of code. This article also describes two
                 improvements that facilitate checking much larger
                 programs: an algorithm for annotation inference and a
                 user interface that clarifies warnings generated by the
                 checker. These extensions have enabled us to use the
                 checker for identifying race conditions in large-scale
                 software systems with up to 500,000 lines of code.",

                 evidence that some relationships follow power-laws,
                 while others do not. We have also observed variations
                 that seem related to some characteristic of the
                 application itself. This study provides important
                 information for researchers who can investigate how and
                 why the structural relationships we find may have
                 originated, what they portend, and how they can be
                 managed.",

  abstract =     "Several programming languages guarantee that array
                 subscripts are checked to ensure they are within the
                 bounds of the array. While this guarantee improves the
                 correctness and security of array-based code, it adds
                 overhead to array references. This has been an obstacle
                 to using higher-level languages, such as Java, for
                 high-performance parallel computing, where the language
                 specification requires that all array accesses must be
                 checked to ensure they are within bounds. This is
                 because, in practice, array-bounds checking in
                 scientific applications may increase execution time by
                 more than a factor of 2. Previous research has explored
                 optimizations to statically eliminate bounds checks,
                 but the dynamic nature of many scientific codes makes
                 this difficult or impossible. Our approach is, instead,
                 to create a compiler and operating system
                 infrastructure that does not generate explicit bounds
                 checks. It instead places arrays inside of Index
                 Confinement Regions (ICRs), which are large, isolated,
                 mostly unmapped virtual memory regions. Any array
                 reference outside of its bounds will cause a protection
                 violation; this provides implicit bounds checking. Our
                 results show that when applying this infrastructure to
                 high-performance computing programs written in Java,
                 the overhead of bounds checking relative to a program
                 with no bounds checks is reduced from an average of
                 63\% to an average of 9\%.",

  abstract =     "Since benchmarks drive computer science research and
                 industry product development, which ones we use and how
                 we evaluate them are key questions for the community.
                 Despite complex runtime tradeoffs due to dynamic
                 compilation and garbage collection required for Java
                 programs, many evaluations still use methodologies
                 developed for C, C++, and Fortran. SPEC, the dominant
                 purveyor of benchmarks, compounded this problem by
                 institutionalizing these methodologies for their Java
                 benchmark suite. This paper recommends benchmarking
                 selection and evaluation methodologies, and introduces
                 the DaCapo benchmarks, a set of open source,
                 client-side Java benchmarks. We demonstrate that the
                 complex interactions of (1) architecture, (2) compiler,
                 (3) virtual machine, (4) memory management, and (5)
                 application require more extensive evaluation than C,
                 C++, and Fortran which stress (4) much less, and do not
                 require \1. We use and introduce new value,
                 time-series, and statistical metrics for static and
                 dynamic properties such as code complexity, code size,
                 heap composition, and pointer mutations. No benchmark
                 suite is definitive, but these metrics show that DaCapo
                 improves over SPEC Java in a variety of ways, including
                 more complex code, richer object behaviors, and more
                 demanding memory system requirements. This paper takes
                 a step towards improving methodologies for choosing and
                 evaluating benchmarks to foster innovation in system
                 design and implementation for Java and other managed

  abstract =     "Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is attracting
                 attention from both research and industry, as
                 illustrated by the ever-growing popularity of AspectJ,
                 the de facto standard AOP extension of Java. From a
                 compiler construction perspective AspectJ is
                 interesting as it is a typical example of compositional
                 language, i.e., a language composed of a number of
                 separate languages with different syntactical styles:
                 in addition to plain Java, AspectJ includes a language
                 for defining pointcuts and one for defining advices.
                 Language composition represents a non-trivial challenge
                 for conventional parsing techniques. First, combining
                 several languages with different lexical syntax leads
                 to considerable complexity in the lexical states to
                 processed. Second, as new language features for AOP are
                 being explored, many research proposals are concerned
                 with further extending the AspectJ language, resulting
                 in a need for an extensible syntax definition. This
                 paper shows how scannerless parsing elegantly addresses
                 the issues encountered by conventional techniques when
                 parsing AspectJ . We present the design of a modular,
                 extensible, and formal definition of the lexical and
                 context-free aspects of the AspectJ syntax in the
                 Syntax Definition Formalism SDF, which is implemented
                 by a scannerless, generalized-LR parser (SGLR). We
                 introduce grammar mixins as a novel application of
                 SDF's modularity features, which allows the declarative
                 definition of different keyword policies and
                 combination of extensions. We illustrate the modular
                 extensibility of our definition with syntax extensions
                 taken from current research on aspect languages.
                 Finally, benchmarks show the reasonable performance of
                 scannerless generalized-LR parsing for this grammar.",

                 exists between collecting garbage too frequently and
                 not collecting it frequently enough. Garbage collection
                 that occurs too frequently may introduce unnecessary
                 overheads at the risk of not collecting much garbage
                 during each cycle. On the other hand, collecting
                 garbage too infrequently can result in applications
                 that execute with a large amount of virtual memory
                 (i.e., with a large footprint) and suffer from
                 increased execution times due to paging. In this
                 article, we use a large set of Java applications and
                 the highly tuned and widely used Boehm-Demers-Weiser
                 (BDW) conservative mark-and-sweep garbage collector to
                 experimentally examine the extent to which the
                 frequency of garbage collection impacts an
                 application's execution time, footprint, and pause
                 times. We use these results to devise some guidelines
                 for controlling garbage collection and heap growth in a
                 conservative garbage collector in order to minimize
                 application execution times. Then we describe new
                 strategies for controlling garbage collection and heap
                 growth that impact not only the frequency with which
                 garbage collection occurs but also the points at which
                 it occurs. Experimental results demonstrate that when
                 compared with the existing approach used in the
                 standard BDW collector, our new strategy can
                 significantly reduce application execution times. Our
                 goal is to obtain a better understanding of how to
                 control garbage collection and heap growth for an
                 individual application executing in isolation. These
                 results can be applied in a number of high-performance
                 computing and server environments, in addition to some
                 single-user environments. This work should also provide

                 'almost compositional' means that for a number of the

                 depends only on the constructor and the results of

                 The pattern consists of a generic part constructed once

                 task-specific part. The generic part contains the code

                 a program has been a long standing problem for compiler
                 writers. To reduce the complexity of this task,
                 existing approaches typically apply the same set of
                 optimizations to all procedures within a program,
                 without regard to their particular structure. This

                 automatically selects the best optimizations on a per
                 method basis within a dynamic compiler. Our approach
                 uses the machine learning technique of logistic

                 that determines which optimizations to apply based on
                 the features of a method. This technique is implemented
                 in the Jikes RVM Java JIT compiler. Using this approach
                 we reduce the average total execution time of the

                 is applied to the DaCapo+ benchmark suite, we obtain an

                 improved by coallocating contemporaneously accessed
                 heap objects in the same cache block. We present a
                 novel profile-based analysis for producing such a
                 layout. The analysis achieves cache-conscious
                 coallocation of a hot data stream H (i.e., a regular
                 data access pattern that frequently repeats) by
                 isolating and combining allocation sites of object
                 instances that appear in H such that intervening
                 allocations coming from other sites are separated. The
                 coallocation solution produced by the analysis is
                 enforced by an automatic tool, cminstr, that redirects
                 a program's heap allocations to a run-time coallocation
                 library comalloc. We also extend the analysis to
                 coallocation at object field granularity. The resulting
                 field coallocation solution generalizes common data
                 restructuring techniques, such as field reordering,
                 object splitting, and object merging, and allows their
                 combination. Furthermore, it provides insight into
                 object restructuring by breaking down the coallocation
                 benefit on a per-technique basis, which provides the
                 opportunity to pick the 'sweet spot' for each program.
                 Experimental results using a set of
                 memory-performance-limited benchmarks, including a few
                 SPECInt2000 programs, and Microsoft VisualFoxPro,
                 indicate that programs possess significant coallocation
                 opportunities. Automatic object coallocation improves
                 execution time by 13\% on average in the presence of
                 hardware prefetching. Hand-implemented field
                 coallocation solutions for two of the benchmarks
                 produced additional improvements (12\% and 22\%) but
                 the effort involved suggests implementing an automated

                 type, which allows covariant and contravariant
                 subtyping on fields where appropriate. Previous
                 approaches formalise variant type as a special case of
                 the existential type system. In this paper, we present
                 a new framework based on flow analysis and modular type
                 checking to provide a simple but accurate model for
                 capturing generic types. Our scheme stands to benefit
                 from past (and future) advances in flow analysis and
                 subtyping constraints. Furthermore, it fully supports
                 casting for variant types with a special reflection
                 mechanism, called cast capture, to handle objects with
                 unknown types. We have built a constraint-based type
                 checker and have proven its soundness. We have also

                 multiple dispatch provides a solution to the binary

                 extensibility problem of object-oriented programming
                 languages, allowing the modular addition of both new
                 types and new operations to an existing type hierarchy.
                 This article illustrates and motivates the design of
                 MultiJava and describes its modular static typechecking
                 and modular compilation strategies. Although MultiJava
                 extends Java, the key ideas of the language design are
                 applicable to other object-oriented languages, such as
                 C\# and C++, and even, with some modifications, to
                 functional languages such as ML. This article also
                 discusses the variety of application domains in which

                 including pervasive computing, graphical user

                 Language, pronounced 'Gee-tel'), a novel language for
                 querying JAVA [8] programs. JTL was designed to serve
                 the development of source code software tools for JAVA,
                 and as a small language which to aid programming
                 language extensions to JAVA. Applications include
                 definition of pointcuts for aspect-oriented
                 programming, fixing type constraints for generic
                 programming, specification of encapsulation policies,
                 definition of micro-patterns, etc. We argue that the
                 JTL expression of each of these is systematic, concise,
                 intuitive and general. JTL relies on a simply-typed
                 relational database for program representation, rather
                 than an abstract syntax tree. The underlying semantics
                 of the language is restricted to queries formulated in
                 First Order Predicate Logic augmented with transitive
                 closure (FOPL). Special effort was taken to ensure
                 terse, yet readable expression of logical conditions.
                 The JTL pattern public abstract class, for example,
                 matches all abstract classes which are publicly
                 accessible, while class (public clone();) matches all
                 classes in which method clone is public. To this end,
                 JTL relies on a DATALOG-like syntax and semantics,
                 enriched with quantifiers and pattern matching which
                 all but entirely eliminate the need for recursive
                 calls. JTL's query analyzer gives special attention to
                 the fragility of the 'closed world assumption' in
                 examining JAVA software, and determines whether a query
                 relies on such an assumption. The performance of the
                 JTL interpreter is comparable to that of JQuery after
                 it generated its database cache, and at least an order
                 of magnitude faster when the cache has to be rebuilt.",

                 optimizations, we study the main optimizations
                 available on Sun HotSpot compilers for a wide range of
                 scientific and non-scientific benchmarks, weighing
                 their cost and benefits in total runtime. We chose the

                 the most widespread programming languages recently.
                 Besides being quite easy to get familiar with them,
                 they are also perfectly suitable for business software
                 development. Although the productivity of imperative
                 languages is much acclaimed, some problems are much
                 easier to solve in a logical language. The paper
                 introduces a Java language extension called Japlo,
                 which fits the Prolog language constructs into Java
                 harmonically. Blurring the borders between the
                 representatives of these two paradigms, the author aims
                 at making the logical programming tools more easily
                 available for Java programmers. Japlo does not only
                 provide a foreign language interface to Prolog
                 programs, but you can write Prolog rules within the
                 language relying on some basic concepts (static typing,
                 expression orientation) and the grammatic structure of
                 Java.",

  abstract =     "The proxy abstraction has a longlasting tradition in
                 object settings. From design pattern to inherent
                 language support, from remote method invocations to
                 simple forms of behavioral reflection - incarnations as
                 well as applications of proxies are innumerable. Since
                 version 1.3, Java supports the concept of dynamic
                 proxy. Such an object conforms to a set of types
                 specified by the program and can be used wherever an
                 expression of any of these types is expected, yet
                 reifies invocations performed on it. Dynamic proxies
                 have been applied to implement paradigms as diverse as
                 behavioral reflection, structural conformance, or
                 multi-methods. Alas, these proxies are only available
                 'for interfaces'. The case of creating dynamic proxies
                 for a set of types including a class type has not been
                 considered, meaning that it is currently not possible
                 to create a dynamic proxy mimicking an instance of a
                 given class. This weakness strongly limits any
                 application of dynamic proxies. In this paper we unfold
                 the current support for dynamic proxies in Java,
                 assessing it in the light of a set of generic criteria
                 for proxy implementations. We present an approach to
                 supporting dynamic proxies 'for classes' in Java,
                 consisting in transformations performed on classes at
                 load-time, including a generic scheme for enforcing
                 encapsulation upon field accesses. These
                 transformations seemlessly extend the scope of the
                 current support for dynamic proxies. We discuss the
                 precise benefits and costs of our extension in terms of
                 the criteria introduced, and illustrate the usefulness
                 of uniformly available proxies by implementing future
                 method invocations both safely and transparently.",

  abstract =     "The objective of extensible DBMSs is to ease the
                 construction of specialized DBMSs for nontraditional
                 applications. Although much work has been done in
                 providing various levels of extensibility (e.g.,
                 extensibility of data types and operators, query
                 language extensibility, and query optimizer
                 extensibility), there has been very limited research in
                 providing extensibility at the buffer management level.
                 Supporting extensibility at the buffer management level
                 is important as it can contribute significantly to
                 overall system performance. This paper addresses the
                 problem of supporting extensibility of buffer
                 replacement policies. The main contribution is the
                 proposal of a framework for modeling buffer replacement
                 policies. This work is novel in two aspects. First, by
                 providing a uniform and generic specification of buffer
                 replacement policies, the proposed framework unifies
                 existing work in this area. Second, our work introduces
                 a new level of extensibility. None of the existing
                 extensible DBMSs, to our knowledge, provides
                 extensibility at the buffer management level. The
                 proposed framework provides a basis for the
                 construction of an extensible buffer manager as part of
                 a 100\% Java-based storage manager. We conducted an
                 extensive performance study to investigate the
                 performance of the proposed framework. The experimental
                 results demonstrate that the proposed framework is
                 indeed feasible for existing DBMSs and improves system
                 performance significantly without costing significant
                 overhead.",

                 Rats!, a parser generator for Java that supports easily
                 extensible syntax. Our parser generator builds on
                 recent research on parsing expression grammars (PEGs),
                 which, by being closed under composition, prioritizing
                 choices, supporting unlimited lookahead, and
                 integrating lexing and parsing, offer an attractive
                 alternative to context-free grammars. PEGs are
                 implemented by so-called packrat parsers, which are
                 recursive descent parsers that memoize all intermediate
                 results (hence their name). Memoization ensures
                 linear-time performance in the presence of unlimited
                 lookahead, but also results in an essentially lazy,
                 functional parsing technique. In this paper, we explore
                 how to leverage PEGs and packrat parsers as the
                 foundation for extensible syntax. In particular, we
                 show how make packrat parsing more widely applicable by
                 implementing this lazy, functional technique in a
                 strict, imperative language, while also generating
                 better performing parsers through aggressive
                 optimizations. Next, we develop a module system for
                 organizing, modifying, and composing large-scale
                 syntactic specifications. Finally, we describe a new
                 technique for managing (global) parsing state in
                 functional parsers. Our experimental evaluation
                 demonstrates that the resulting parser generator
                 succeeds at providing extensible syntax. In particular,
                 Rats! enables other grammar writers to realize
                 real-world language extensions in little time and code,
                 and it generates parsers that consistently out-perform
                 parsers created by two GLR parser generators.",

                 provides a flexible framework for implementing
                 object-based software transactional memory (STM). The
                 library uses transactional factories to transform
                 sequential (unsynchronized) classes into atomic
                 (transactionally synchronized) ones, providing a
                 substantial improvement over the awkward programming
                 interface of our previous DSTM library. Furthermore,
                 researchers can experiment with alternative STM
                 mechanisms by providing their own factories. We
                 demonstrate this flexibility by presenting two
                 factories: one that uses essentially the same
                 mechanisms as the original DSTM (with some
                 enhancements),and another that uses a completely
                 different approach. Because DSTM2 is packaged as a Java
                 library, a wide range of programmers can easily try it
                 out, and the community can begin to gain experience
                 with transactional programming. Furthermore,
                 researchers will be able to use the body of
                 transactional programs that arises from this community
                 experience to test and evaluate different STM
                 mechanisms simply by supplying new transactional
                 factories. We believe that this flexible approach will
                 help to build consensus about the best ways to
                 implement transactions, and will avoid the premature
                 'lock-in' that may arise if STM mechanisms are baked
                 into compilers before such experimentation is done.",

                 programs in object-oriented languages, such as Java and
                 C\#, that require garbage collection. Garbage
                 collection traces and simulation speed up research by
                 enabling deeper understandings of object lifetime
                 behavior and quick exploration and design of new
                 garbage collection algorithms. When generating perfect
                 traces, the brute-force method of computing object
                 lifetimes requires a whole-heap garbage collection at
                 every potential collection point in the program.
                 Because this process is prohibitively expensive,
                 researchers often use granulated traces by collecting
                 only periodically, for example, every 32 KB of
                 allocation. We extend the state of the art for
                 simulating garbage collection algorithms in two ways.
                 First, we develop a systematic methodology for
                 simulation studies of copying garbage collection and
                 present results showing the effects of trace
                 granularity on these simulations. We show that trace
                 granularity often distorts simulated garbage collection
                 results compared with perfect traces. Second, we
                 present and measure the performance of a new algorithm
                 called Merlin for computing object lifetimes. Merlin
                 timestamps objects and later uses the timestamps of
                 dead objects to reconstruct when they died. The Merlin
                 algorithm piggybacks on garbage collections performed
                 by the base system. Experimental results show that
                 Merlin can generate traces over two orders of magnitude
                 faster than the brute-force method which collects after
                 every object allocation. We also use Merlin to produce
                 visualizations of heap behavior that expose new object
                 lifetime behaviors.",

                 application memory spaces and dangling pointers within

  abstract =     "We develop the mechanism of variant parametric types
                 as a means to enhance synergy between parametric and
                 inclusion polymorphism in object-oriented programming
                 languages. Variant parametric types are used to control
                 both the subtyping between different instantiations of
                 one generic class and the accessibility of their fields
                 and methods. On one hand, one parametric class can be
                 used to derive covariant types, contravariant types,
                 and bivariant types (generally called variant
                 parametric types) by attaching a variance annotation to
                 a type argument. On the other hand, the type system
                 prohibits certain method\slash field accesses,
                 according to variance annotations, when these accesses
                 may otherwise make the program unsafe. By exploiting
                 variant parametric types, a programmer can write
                 generic code abstractions that work on a wide range of
                 parametric types in a safe manner. For instance, a
                 method that only reads the elements of a container of
                 numbers can be easily modified so as to accept
                 containers of integers, floating-point numbers, or any
                 subtype of the number type. Technical subtleties in
                 typing for the proposed mechanism are addressed in
                 terms of an intuitive correspondence between variant
                 parametric and bounded existential types. Then, for a
                 rigorous argument of correctness of the proposed typing
                 rules, we extend Featherweight GJ---an existing formal
                 core calculus for Java with generics---with variant
                 parametric types and prove type soundness.",

                 not sufficient since the choice of run-time semantics
                 may introduce subtle programming errors. It is the aim
                 of this paper to exemplify the importance of process
                 queuing and awaking policies resulting from possible
                 choices of the monitor concept implementation.The first
                 part of the paper compares the behaviour of concurrent
                 processes sharing a unique waiting queue for condition
                 synchronization when implemented in Java or in Ada. A
                 particular solution of the dining philosophers paradigm
                 will be used to show how the difference in the monitor
                 semantics may lead or not to deadlock. This comparison
                 provides insight for deriving a correct Java
                 implementation. The second part of the paper shows how
                 the implementation can be refined when using Ada entry
                 families and requeue with requeue once restriction. The
                 result is elegant, safe and fair, and deterministic.
                 This paper ends with quantitative comparisons of
                 concurrency complexity and of concurrency
                 effectiveness.We conclude that Java and C\#

                 architectures to 64-bit architectures, while most of
                 the programs available today are still designed for
                 32-bit architectures. Java, for example, specifies the
                 frequently used ``int'' as a 32-bit signed integer. If
                 such Java programs are executed on a 64-bit

                 sign-extended to 64-bit signed integers for correct
                 operations. This causes serious performance overhead.
                 In this article, we present a fast and effective

                 (such as TRT and TROT instructions on IBM zSeries) to
                 accelerate certain functions such as delimiter search
                 and character conversion. Such special instructions
                 have often been used in high performance libraries, but
                 they have not been exploited well in optimizing
                 compilers except for some limited cases. We propose a
                 new idiom recognition technique derived from a
                 topological embedding algorithm [4] to detect idiom
                 patterns in the input program more aggressively than in
                 previous approaches. Our approach can detect a pattern
                 even if the code segment does not exactly match the
                 idiom. For example, we can detect a code segment that
                 includes additional code within the idiom pattern. We
                 implemented our new idiom recognition approach based on
                 the Java Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that is part of
                 the J9 Java Virtual Machine, and we supported several
                 important idioms for special hardware-assist
                 instructions on the IBM zSeries and on some models of
                 the IBM pSeries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
                 our technique, we performed two experiments. The first
                 one is to see how many more patterns we can detect
                 compared to the previous approach. The second one is to
                 see how much performance improvement we can achieve
                 over the previous approach. For the first experiment,
                 we used the Java Compatibility Kit (JCK) API tests. For
                 the second one we used IBM XML parser, SPECjvm98, and
                 SPCjbb2000. In summary, relative to a baseline
                 implementation using exact pattern matching, our
                 algorithm converted 75\% more loops in JCK tests. We
                 also observed significant performance improvement of
                 the XML parser by 64\%, of SPECjvm98 by 1\%, and of
                 SPECjbb2000 by 2\% on average on a z990. Finally, we
                 observed the JIT compilation time increases by only

                 drawback in that it does not move objects during
                 collection. As a result, large long-running realistic
                 applications, such as Web application servers,
                 frequently face the fragmentation problem. To eliminate
                 fragmentation, a heap compaction is run periodically.
                 However, compaction typically imposes very long
                 undesirable pauses in the application. While efficient
                 concurrent collectors are ubiquitous in production
                 runtime systems (such as JVMs), an efficient
                 non-intrusive compactor is still missing. In this paper
                 we present the Compressor, a novel compaction algorithm
                 that is concurrent, parallel, and incremental. The
                 Compressor compacts the entire heap to a single
                 condensed area, while preserving the objects' order,
                 but reduces pause times significantly, thereby allowing
                 acceptable runs on large heaps. Furthermore, the
                 Compressor is the first compactor that requires only a
                 single heap pass. As such, it is the most efficient
                 compactors known today, even when run in a parallel
                 Stop-the-World manner (i.e., when the program threads
                 are halted). Thus, to the best of our knowledge, the
                 Compressor is the most efficient compactor known today.
                 The Compressor was implemented on a Jikes Research RVM

                 unsuitable for multiprocessor systems. According to
                 conventional wisdom, the update of reference slots and
                 reference-counts requires atomic or synchronized
                 operations. In this work we demonstrate this is not the
                 case by presenting a novel reference-counting algorithm
                 suitable for a multiprocessor system that does not
                 require any synchronized operation in its write barrier
                 (not even a compare-and-swap type of synchronization).
                 A second novelty of this algorithm is that it allows
                 eliminating a large fraction of the reference count
                 updates, thus, drastically reducing the
                 reference-counting traditional overhead. This article
                 includes a full proof of the algorithm showing that it
                 is safe (does not reclaim live objects) and live
                 (eventually reclaims all unreachable objects).\par

                 We have implemented our algorithm on Sun Microsystems'

                 deployment. However, these frameworks are not built
                 around fundamental principles as much as they are
                 engineering efforts closely tied to particulars of the
                 respective systems. Here we aim to elucidate the
                 fundamental principles of software deployment, in a

                 and how to wire components together, versioning,
                 version dependencies, and hot-deployment of components.
                 We define the application buildbox as the place where
                 software is developed and deployed, and define a formal
                 Labeled Transition System (LTS) on the buildbox with

                 component is shipped with a certain version dependency,
                 then at run time that dependency must be satisfied with
                 a compatible version. Our treatment of deployment is
                 both platform- and vendor-independent, and we show how

                 language feature that makes expressive iteration
                 abstractions much easier to implement. Iteration
                 abstractions are valuable for software design, as shown
                 by their frequent use in well-designed data structure
                 libraries such as the Java Collections Framework. While
                 Java iterators support iteration abstraction well from
                 the standpoint of client code, they are awkward to
                 implement correctly and efficiently, especially if the
                 iterator needs to support imperative update of the
                 underlying collection, such as removing the current
                 element. Some languages, such as CLU and C\# 2.0,
                 support iteration through a limited coroutine
                 mechanism, but these mechanisms do not support
                 imperative updates. Interruptible iterators are more
                 powerful coroutines in which the loop body is able to
                 interrupt the iterator with requests to perform
                 updates. Interrupts are similar to exceptions, but
                 propagate differently and have resumption semantics.
                 Interruptible iterators have been implemented as part
                 of the JMatch programming language, an extended version
                 of Java. A JMatch reimplementation of the Java
                 Collections Framework shows that implementations can be

  abstract =     "Understanding the behavior of applications running on
                 high-level language virtual machines, as is the case in
                 Java, is non-trivial because of the tight entanglement
                 at the lowest execution level between the application
                 and the virtual machine. This paper proposes Javana, a
                 system for building Java program analysis tools. Javana
                 provides an easy-to-use instrumentation infrastructure
                 that allows for building customized profiling tools
                 very quickly. Javana runs a dynamic binary
                 instrumentation tool underneath the virtual machine.
                 The virtual machine communicates with the
                 instrumentation layer through an event handling
                 mechanism for building a vertical map that links
                 low-level native instruction pointers and memory
                 addresses to high-level language concepts such as
                 objects, methods, threads, lines of code, etc. The
                 dynamic binary instrumentation tool then intercepts all
                 memory accesses and instructions executed and provides
                 the Javana end user with high-level language
                 information for all memory accesses and natively
                 executed instructions. We demonstrate the power of
                 Javana through a number of applications: memory address
                 tracing, vertical cache simulation and object lifetime
                 computation. For each of these applications, the
                 instrumentation specification requires only a small
                 number of lines of code. Developing similarly powerful
                 profiling tools within a virtual machine (as done in
                 current practice) is both time-consuming and
                 error-prone; in addition, the accuracy of the obtained
                 profiling results might be questionable as we show in
                 this paper.",

                 representation to embed, propagate, and preserve safety
                 information in high performance compilers for safe
                 languages such as Java and C\#. Our representation
                 precisely encodes safety information via static
                 single-assignment (SSA) [11, 3] proof variables that
                 are first-class constructs in the program. We argue
                 that our representation allows a compiler to both (1)
                 express aggressively optimized machine-independent code
                 and (2) leverage existing compiler infrastructure to
                 preserve safety information during optimization. We
                 demonstrate that this approach supports standard
                 compiler optimizations, requires minimal changes to the
                 implementation of those optimizations, and does not
                 artificially impede those optimizations to preserve
                 safety. We also describe a simple type system that
                 formalizes type safety in an SSA-style control-flow
                 graph program representation. Through the types of
                 proof variables, our system enables compositional
                 verification of memory safety in optimized code.
                 Finally, we discuss experiences integrating this
                 representation into the machine-independent global
                 optimizer of STARJIT, a high-performance just-in-time
                 compiler that performs aggressive control-flow,

                 spilled out to memory in order to improve results of
                 coloring register allocation. Previous techniques, such

                 nested intersection, building on earlier work on nested
                 inheritance in the language Jx. Nested inheritance
                 permits modular, type-safe extension of a package
                 (including nested packages and classes), while
                 preserving existing type relationships. Nested
                 intersection enables composition and extension of two

                 while resolving conflicts with a relatively small
                 amount of code. The utility of J\& is demonstrated by
                 using it to construct two composable, extensible
                 frameworks: a compiler framework for Java, and a
                 peer-to-peer networking system. Both frameworks support
                 composition of extensions. For example, two compilers

                 be composed to obtain a compiler for a language that
                 supports both sets of features.",

                 Stack unwinding optimizes the normal path by leaving

                 to the normal path.We propose a new technique called
                 {\em Exception-Directed Optimization\/} (EDO) that
                 optimizes exception-intensive programs without slowing
                 down exception-minimal programs. It is a
                 feedback-directed dynamic optimization consisting of
                 three steps: exception path profiling, exception path
                 inlining, and throw elimination. Exception path
                 profiling attempts to detect hot exception paths.
                 Exception path inlining embeds every hot exception path
                 into the corresponding catching method. Throw
                 elimination replaces a throw with a branch to the
                 corresponding handler. We implemented EDO in IBM's
                 production Just-in-Time compiler and made several
                 experiments. In summary, it improved the performance of
                 exception-intensive programs by up to 18.3\% without
                 decreasing the performance of exception-minimal
                 programs for SPECjvm98. We also found an opportunity
                 for performance improvement using EDO in the startup of
                 a Java application server.",

                 by the advance of Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation
                 technologies. However, debugging such a dynamic
                 compiler is much harder than a static compiler.
                 Recompiling the problematic method to produce a
                 diagnostic output does not necessarily work as
                 expected, because the compilation of a method depends
                 on runtime information at the time of compilation. In
                 this paper, we propose a new approach, called replay
                 JIT compilation, which can reproduce the same
                 compilation remotely by using two compilers, the
                 state-saving compiler and the replaying compiler. The
                 state-saving compiler is used in a normal run, and,
                 while compiling a method, records into a log all of the
                 input for the compiler. The replaying compiler is then
                 used in a debugging run with the system dump, to
                 recompile a method with the options for diagnostic
                 output. We reduced the overhead to save the input by
                 using the system dump and by categorizing the input
                 based on how its value changes. In our experiment, the
                 increase of the compilation time for saving the input
                 was only 1\%, and the size of the additional memory
                 needed for saving the input was only 10\% of the
                 compiler-generated code.",

                 memory approach for simplifying the design of
                 concurrent data structures. Predictive
                 log-synchronization simplifies concurrent programming
                 and program verification by requiring programmers to
                 write only specialized sequential code. This sequential
                 code is then automatically transformed into a
                 non-blocking concurrent program in which threads
                 coordinate all data structure operations via a shared
                 lock-controlled log. The non-blocking progress property
                 is achieved by having threads that fail to acquire the
                 lock predict the outcome of their operations by reading
                 the log and state and computing the effect of these
                 operations without modifying the actual data structure.
                 Log-synchronization is founded on the belief (at this
                 point unsubstantiated by statistical data) that in many
                 concurrent data structures used in real-world

                 modify the structure to ones that simply read it,
                 greatly favors read-only operations, and what's more,
                 that many natural data structures have inherent
                 sequential bottlenecks limiting the concurrency among
                 operations that modify the structure. It follows that
                 delegating all data structure modifications to a single
                 lock-controlled thread at a time will not significantly
                 harm the throughput of modifying operations. Moreover,
                 as we show, it can boost read-only throughput by
                 significantly reducing the overhead of coordination
                 among concurrent operations, and provides a way to
                 simplify concurrent data structures. Initial
                 experimental testing using a Java-based implementation
                 of predictive log-synchronization showed that a
                 log-synchronized concurrent red-black tree is up to
                 five times faster than a simple lock-based one. This
                 paper presents our current understanding of the
                 advantages, drawbacks, and scope of predictive
                 log-synchronization.",

                 worst-case latencies on the order of a millisecond,
                 this technology is approaching its practical limits.
                 For tasks requiring extremely low latency, and
                 especially periodic tasks with frequencies above 1 KHz,
                 Java programmers must currently resort to the
                 NoHeapRealtimeThread construct of the Real-Time
                 Specification for Java. This technique requires
                 expensive run-time checks, can result in unpredictable
                 low-level exceptions, and inhibits communication with
                 the rest of the garbage-collected application. We
                 present Eventrons, a programming construct that can
                 arbitrarily preempt the garbage collector, yet
                 guarantees safety and allows its data to be visible to

                 analysis and simple run-time support with extremely low

                 database to retrieve persistent data and then present
                 the data to the user as dynamically generated output,
                 such as HTML web pages. However, this interaction is
                 commonly done through a low-level API by dynamically
                 constructing query strings within a general-purpose
                 programming language, such as Java. This low-level
                 interaction is ad hoc because it does not take into
                 account the structure of the output language.
                 Accordingly, user inputs are treated as isolated
                 lexical entities which, if not properly sanitized, can
                 cause the web application to generate unintended
                 output. This is called a command injection attack,
                 which poses a serious threat to web application
                 security. This paper presents the first formal
                 definition of command injection attacks in the context
                 of web applications, and gives a sound and complete
                 algorithm for preventing them based on context-free
                 grammars and compiler parsing techniques. Our key
                 observation is that, for an attack to succeed, the
                 input that gets propagated into the database query or
                 the output document must change the intended syntactic
                 structure of the query or document. Our definition and
                 algorithm are general and apply to many forms of
                 command injection attacks. We validate our approach
                 with SqlCheckS, an implementation for the setting of
                 SQL command injection attacks. We evaluated SqlCheckS
                 on real-world web applications with systematically
                 compiled real-world attack data as input. SqlCheckS
                 produced no false positives or false negatives,
                 incurred low runtime overhead, and applied
                 straightforwardly to web applications written in

  abstract =     "Method inlining and data flow analysis are two major
                 optimization components for effective program
                 transformations, but they often suffer from the
                 existence of rarely or never executed code contained in
                 the target method. One major problem lies in the
                 assumption that the compilation unit is partitioned at
                 method boundaries. This article describes the design
                 and implementation of a region-based compilation
                 technique in our dynamic optimization framework, in
                 which the compiled regions are selected as code
                 portions without rarely executed code. The key parts of
                 this technique are the region selection, partial
                 inlining, and region exit handling. For region
                 selection, we employ both static heuristics and dynamic
                 profiles to identify and eliminate rare sections of
                 code. The region selection process and method inlining
                 decisions are interwoven, so that method inlining
                 exposes other targets for region selection, while the
                 region selection in the inline target conserves the
                 inlining budget, allowing more method inlining to be
                 performed. The inlining process can be performed for
                 parts of a method, not just for the entire body of the
                 method. When the program attempts to exit from a region
                 boundary, we trigger recompilation and then use
                 on-stack replacement to continue the execution from the
                 corresponding entry point in the recompiled code. We
                 have implemented these techniques in our Java JIT
                 compiler, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. The
                 experimental results show that our region-based
                 compilation approach achieves approximately 4\%
                 performance improvement on average, while reducing the
                 compilation overhead by 10\% to 30\%, in comparison to
                 the traditional method-based compilation techniques.",

                 development has increased more than ten-fold over the

                 mainstream C/C++/Java/C\# language family remain
                 largely unaddressed. The talk begins with a high-level
                 presentation of the game developer's world: the kinds
                 of algorithms we employ on modern CPUs and GPUs, the
                 difficulties of componentization and concurrency, and
                 the challenges of writing very complex software with

                 threads access shared data and interleave in ways that
                 do not correspond to any sequential execution. Their
                 absence is not guaranteed by the traditional notion of
                 'data race' freedom. We present a new definition of
                 data races in terms of 11 problematic interleaving
                 scenarios, and prove that it is complete by showing
                 that any execution not exhibiting these scenarios is
                 serializable for a chosen set of locations. Our
                 definition subsumes the traditional definition of a
                 data race as well as high-level data races such as
                 stale-value errors and inconsistent views. We also
                 propose a language feature called atomic sets of
                 locations, which lets programmers specify the existence
                 of consistency properties between fields in objects,
                 without specifying the properties themselves. We use
                 static analysis to automatically infer those points in
                 the code where synchronization is needed to avoid data
                 races under our new definition. An important benefit of
                 this approach is that, in general, far fewer
                 annotations are required than is the case with existing
                 approaches such as synchronized blocks or atomic

  abstract =     "The Java language is popular because of its platform
                 independence, making it useful in a lot of technologies
                 ranging from embedded devices to high-performance
                 systems. The platform-independent property of Java,
                 which is visible at the Java bytecode level, is only
                 made possible thanks to the availability of a Virtual
                 Machine (VM), which needs to be designed specifically
                 for each underlying hardware platform. More
                 specifically, the same Java bytecode should run
                 properly on a 32-bit or a 64-bit VM. In this paper, we
                 compare the behavioral characteristics of 32-bit and
                 64-bit VMs using a large set of Java benchmarks. This
                 is done using the Jikes Research VM as well as the IBM
                 JDK 1.4.0 production VM on a PowerPC-based IBM machine.
                 By running the PowerPC machine in both 32-bit and
                 64-bit mode we are able to compare 32-bit and 64-bit
                 VMs. We conclude that the space an object takes in the
                 heap in 64-bit mode is 39.3\% larger on average than in
                 32-bit mode. We identify three reasons for this: (i)
                 the larger pointer size, (ii) the increased header and
                 (iii) the increased alignment. The minimally required
                 heap size is 51.1\% larger on average in 64-bit than in
                 32-bit mode. From our experimental setup using hardware
                 performance monitors, we observe that 64-bit computing
                 typically results in a significantly larger number of
                 data cache misses at all levels of the memory
                 hierarchy. In addition, we observe that when a
                 sufficiently large heap is available, the IBM JDK 1.4.0
                 VM is 1.7\% slower on average in 64-bit mode than in
                 32-bit mode.",

                 object-oriented (OO) programming language construct
                 designed to support object adaptation. Expanders allow
                 existing classes to be noninvasively updated with new
                 methods, fields, and superinterfaces. Each client can
                 customize its view of a class by explicitly importing
                 any number of expanders. This view then applies to all
                 instances of that class, including objects passed to
                 the client from other components. A form of expander
                 overriding allows expanders to interact naturally with
                 OO-style inheritance. We describe the design,
                 implementation, and evaluation of eJava, an extension
                 to Java supporting expanders. We illustrate eJava's
                 syntax and semantics through several examples. The
                 statically scoped nature of expander usage allows for a
                 modular static type system that prevents several
                 important classes of errors. We describe this modular
                 static type system informally, formalize eJava and its
                 type system in an extension to Featherweight Java, and
                 prove a type soundness theorem for the formalization.
                 We also describe a modular compilation strategy for
                 eJava, which we have implemented using the Polyglot

                 commercially-significant systems, for example, Sun
                 Microsystems' Java and Microsoft's .NET. The virtual
                 machine offers many advantages to the system designer
                 and administrator, but complicates the task of workload
                 characterization: it presents an extra abstraction
                 layer between the application and observed hardware
                 effects. Understanding the behavior of the virtual
                 machine is therefore important for all levels of the
                 system architecture.\par

                 We have constructed a tool which examines the state of
                 a Sun Java HotSpot virtual machine running inside
                 Virtutech's Simics execution-driven simulator. We can
                 obtain detailed information about the virtual machine
                 and application without disturbing the state of the
                 simulation. For data, we can answer such questions as:
                 Is a given address in the heap? If so, in which object?
                 Of what class? For code, we can map program counter
                 values back to Java methods and approximate Java source
                 line information. Our tool allows us to relate
                 individual events in the simulation, for example, a
                 cache miss, to the higher-level behavior of the
                 application and virtual machine.\par

                 In this report, we present the design of our tool,
                 including its capabilities and limitations, and

                 profile information is highly intrusive due to the high
                 frequency of method calls in most applications.
                 Previously proposed calling-context profiling
                 mechanisms consequently suffer from either low

                 inhibiting redundant profiling, this approach
                 dramatically reduces overhead while preserving profile
                 accuracy. We first demonstrate the drawbacks of
                 previously proposed calling context profiling
                 mechanisms. We show that a low-overhead solution using
                 sampled stack-walking alone is less than 50\% accurate,
                 based on degree of overlap with a complete
                 calling-context tree. We also show that a static
                 bursting approach collects a highly accurate profile,
                 but causes an unacceptable application slowdown. Our
                 adaptive solution achieves 85\% degree of overlap and
                 provides an 88\% hot-edge coverage when using a 0.1
                 hot-edge threshold, while dramatically reducing

                 provenly correct in the sense that it preserves the
                 static and dynamic semantics. Moreover, it is
                 compatible with separate compilation, since the
                 translation of a Fickle class does not depend on the
                 implementation of used classes. Based on the formal
                 system, we have developed an implementation.

                 The translation turned out to be a more subtle problem
                 than we expected. In this article, we discuss four
                 possible approaches we considered for the design of the
                 translation and to justify our choice, we present
                 formally the translation and proof of preservation of
                 the static and dynamic semantics, and discuss the
                 prototype implementation. Moreover, we outline an
                 alternative translation based on generics that avoids
                 most of the casts (but not all) needed in the previous
                 translation.

                 systems suffer from a low level of abstraction and

                 domains. As a result, real-time systems are difficult
                 to test and must be re-certified every time changes are
                 made to either the software or hardware environment.
                 Exotasks are a novel Java programming construct that
                 achieve deterministic timing, even in the presence of
                 other Java threads, and across changes of hardware and
                 software platform. They are deterministic functional
                 data-flow tasks written in Java, combined with an
                 orthogonal scheduling policy based on the logical
                 execution time (LET) model. We have built a quad-rotor

  abstract =     "We report on our efforts to use the XMC model checker
                 to model and verify the Java metalocking algorithm. XMC
                 [Ramakrishna et al. 1997] is a versatile and efficient
                 model checker for systems specified in XL, a highly
                 expressive value-passing language. Metalocking [Agesen
                 et al. 1999] is a highly-optimized technique for
                 ensuring mutually exclusive access by threads to object
                 monitor queues and, therefore; plays an essential role
                 in allowing Java to offer concurrent access to objects.
                 Metalocking can be viewed as a two-tiered scheme. At
                 the upper level, the metalock level, a thread waits
                 until it can enqueue itself on an object's monitor
                 queue in a mutually exclusive manner. At the lower
                 level, the monitor-lock level, enqueued threads race to
                 obtain exclusive access to the object. Our abstract XL
                 specification of the metalocking algorithm is fully
                 parameterized, both on the number of threads M, and the
                 number of objects N. It also captures a sophisticated
                 optimization of the basic metalocking algorithm known
                 as extra-fast locking and unlocking of uncontended
                 objects. Using XMC, we show that for a variety of
                 values of M and N, the algorithm indeed provides mutual
                 exclusion and freedom from deadlock and lockout at the
                 metalock level. We also show that, while the
                 monitor-lock level of the protocol preserves mutual
                 exclusion and deadlock-freedom, it is not lockout-free
                 because the protocol's designers chose to give equal
                 preference to awaiting threads and newly arrived
                 threads.",

  abstract =     "Objects often define usage protocols that clients must
                 follow in order for these objects to work properly.
                 Aliasing makes it notoriously difficult to check
                 whether clients and implementations are compliant with
                 such protocols. Accordingly, existing approaches either
                 operate globally or severely restrict aliasing.\par

                 We have developed a sound modular protocol checking
                 approach, based on typestates, that allows a great deal
                 of flexibility in aliasing while guaranteeing the
                 absence of protocol violations at runtime. The main
                 technical contribution is a novel abstraction, access
                 permissions, that combines typestate and object
                 aliasing information. In our methodology, developers
                 express their protocol design intent through
                 annotations based on access permissions. Our checking
                 approach then tracks permissions through method
                 implementations. For each object reference the checker
                 keeps track of the degree of possible aliasing and is
                 appropriately conservative in reasoning about that
                 reference. This helps developers account for object
                 manipulations that may occur through aliases. The
                 checking approach handles inheritance in a novel way,
                 giving subclasses more flexibility in method
                 overriding. Case studies on Java iterators and streams
                 provide evidence that access permissions can model
                 realistic protocols, and protocol checking based on
                 access permissions can be used to reason precisely
                 about the protocols that arise in practice.",

                 regions that the garbage collector will rarely, if
                 ever, collect. We extend previous work on pretenuring
                 as follows: (1) We produce pretenuring advice that is
                 neutral with respect to the garbage collector algorithm
                 and configuration. We thus can and do combine advice
                 from different applications. We find for our benchmarks
                 that predictions using object lifetimes at each
                 allocation site in Java programs are accurate, which
                 simplifies the pretenuring implementation. (2) We
                 gather and apply advice to both applications and Jikes
                 RVM, a compiler and runtime system for Java written in
                 Java. Our results demonstrate that building combined
                 advice into Jikes RVM from different application
                 executions improves performance, regardless of the
                 application Jikes RVM is compiling and executing. This
                 build-time advice thus gives user applications some
                 benefits of pretenuring, without any application
                 profiling. No previous work uses profile feedback to
                 pretenure in the runtime system. (3) We find that
                 application-only advice also consistently improves
                 performance, but that the combination of build-time and
                 application-specific advice is almost always noticeably
                 better. (4) Our same advice improves the performance of
                 generational, Older First, and Beltway collectors,
                 illustrating that it is collector neutral. (5) We
                 include an immortal allocation space in addition to a
                 nursery and older generation, and show that pretenuring
                 to immortal space has substantial benefit.",

  abstract =     "Calling context enhances program understanding and
                 dynamic analyses by providing a rich representation of
                 program location. Compared to imperative programs,
                 object-oriented programs use more interprocedural and
                 less intraprocedural control flow, increasing the
                 importance of context sensitivity for analysis.
                 However, prior online methods for computing calling
                 context, such as stack-walking or maintaining the
                 current location in a calling context tree, are
                 expensive in time and space. This paper introduces a
                 new online approach called probabilistic calling
                 context (PCC) that continuously maintains a
                 probabilistically unique value representing the current
                 calling context. For millions of unique contexts, a
                 32-bit PCC value has few conflicts. Computing the PCC
                 value adds 3\% average overhead to a Java virtual
                 machine. PCC is well-suited to clients that detect new
                 or anomalous behavior since PCC values from training
                 and production runs can be compared easily to detect
                 new context-sensitive behavior; clients that query the
                 PCC value at every system call, Java utility call, and
                 Java API call add 0-9\% overhead on average. PCC adds
                 space overhead proportional to the distinct contexts
                 stored by the client (one word per context). Our
                 results indicate PCC is efficient and accurate enough

                 example, when Java and C\# programs dereference null
                 pointers and when C and C++ programs use undefined
                 values to affect program behavior. A stack trace
                 produced on such a crash identifies the effect of the
                 unusable value, not its cause, and is often not much
                 help to the programmer.\par

                 This paper presents efficient origin tracking of
                 unusable values; it shows how to record where these
                 values come into existence, correctly propagate them,
                 and report them if they cause an error. The key idea is
                 value piggybacking: when the original program stores an
                 unusable value, value piggybacking instead stores
                 origin information in the spare bits of the unusable
                 value. Modest compiler support alters the program to
                 propagate these modified values through operations such
                 as assignments and comparisons. We evaluate two
                 implementations: the first tracks null pointer origins
                 in a JVM, and the second tracks undefined value origins
                 in a memory-checking tool built with Valgrind. These
                 implementations show that origin tracking via value
                 piggybacking is fast and often useful, and in the Java
                 case, has low enough overhead for use in a production

                 with a technical background in software development. No
                 previous experience with safety-critical standards is
                 required. Some familiarity with one or more of C, C++,
                 Ada, or Java would be useful.\par

                 Safety-critical systems (whose anomalous behavior could
                 cause catastrophic or major failure involving loss of
                 life) are becoming increasingly prevalent. Standards
                 such as DO-178B, originally developed for commercial
                 avionics, are attracting attention in other segments.
                 The requirement to comply with such standards imposes
                 constraints (on quality assurance, traceability, etc. )
                 much beyond what is typical for
                 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Software. One of the major
                 decisions that affects safety certification is the
                 choice of programming language(s). Specific language
                 features, either by their presence of absence, may make
                 certification easier or harder. (Practicalities such as
                 tool support and programmer experience are of course
                 also important but are outside the scope of the
                 tutorial).\par

                 This tutorial first summarizes existing safety
                 standards, with a focus on DO-178B, and explains how
                 they affect the requirements on a programming language.
                 It specifically addresses the challenges imposed by
                 Object-Oriented Technology and summarizes the work
                 currently underway on DO-178C. The tutorial then
                 assesses three language technologies -- C (including
                 C++), Ada, and Java - with respect to suitability for
                 meeting these requirements through appropriate
                 subsetting. MISRA C, SPARK, and the in-progress
                 Safety-Critical Java Technology are specifically
                 identified and reviewed.",

                 Multiple Ownership is an ownership type system where

                 19] is a formal framework for software development and
                 analysis, in which the developer specifies desired
                 properties using definable specification formalisms,
                 along with code to execute when properties are violated
                 or validated. The MOP framework automatically generates
                 monitors from the specified properties and then
                 integrates them together with the user-defined code
                 into the original system.\par

                 The previous design of MOP only allowed specifications
                 without parameters, so it could not be used to state
                 and monitor safety properties referring to two or more
                 related objects. In this paper we propose a parametric
                 specification formalism-independent extension of MOP,
                 together with an implementation of JavaMOP that
                 supports parameters. In our current implementation,
                 parametric specifications are translated into AspectJ
                 code and then weaved into the application using
                 off-the-shelf AspectJ compilers; hence, MOP
                 specifications can be seen as formal or logical
                 aspects.\par

                 Our JavaMOP implementation was extensively evaluated on
                 two benchmarks, Dacapo [14] and Tracematches [8],
                 showing that runtime verification in general and MOP in
                 particular are feasible. In some of the examples,
                 millions of monitor instances are generated, each
                 observing a set of related objects. To keep the runtime
                 overhead of monitoring and event observation low, we
                 devised and implemented a decentralized indexing
                 optimization. Less than 8\% of the experiments showed
                 more than 10\% runtime overhead; in most cases our tool
                 generates monitoring code as efficient as the
                 hand-optimized code. Despite its genericity, JavaMOP is
                 empirically shown to be more efficient than runtime
                 verification systems specialized and optimized for
                 particular specification formalisms. Many property
                 violations were detected during our experiments; some
                 of them are benign, others indicate defects in
                 programs. Many of these are subtle and hard to find by
                 ordinary testing.",

                 applications that are secure by construction. In modern
                 web applications, some application functionality is
                 usually implemented as client-side code written in
                 JavaScript. Moving code and data to the client can
                 create security vulnerabilities, but currently there
                 are no good methods for deciding when it is secure to
                 do so. Swift automatically partitions application code
                 while providing assurance that the resulting placement
                 is secure and efficient. Application code is written as
                 Java-like code annotated with information flow policies

  abstract =     "Managing power concerns in microprocessors has become
                 a pressing research problem across the domains of
                 computer architecture, CAD, and compilers. As a result,
                 several parameterized cycle-level power simulators have
                 been introduced. While these simulators can be quite
                 useful for microarchitectural studies, their generality
                 limits how accurate they can be for any one chip
                 family. Furthermore, their hardware focus means that
                 they do not explicitly enable studying the interaction
                 of different software layers, such as Java applications
                 and their underlying runtime system software. This
                 paper describes and evaluates XTREM, a power-simulation
                 tool tailored for the Intel XScale microarchitecture.
                 In building XTREM, our goals were to develop a
                 microarchitecture simulator that, while still offering
                 size parameterizations for cache and other structures,
                 more accurately reflected a realistic processor
                 pipeline. We present a detailed set of validations
                 based on multimeter power measurements and hardware
                 performance counter sampling. XTREM exhibits an average
                 performance error of only 6.5\% and an even smaller
                 average power error: 4\%. The paper goes on to present
                 an application study enabled by the simulator. Namely,
                 we use XTREM to produce an energy consumption breakdown
                 for Java CDC and CLDC applications. Our simulator
                 measurements indicate that a large percentage of the
                 total energy consumption (up to 35\%) is devoted to the
                 virtual machine's support functions.",

                 reduce the reliability of software systems.
                 Constraint-based datastructure repair promises to help
                 programs recover from potentially crippling corruption
                 errors. Prior work repairs a variety of relatively
                 small data structures, usually with hundreds of
                 nodes.\par

                 We present STARC which uses static analysis to repair
                 data structures with tens of thousands of nodes. Given
                 a Java predicate method that describes the integrity
                 constraints of a structure, STARC statically analyzes
                 the method to identify: (1) the recurrent fields, i.e.,
                 fields that the predicate method uses to traverse the
                 structure; and (2) local field constraints, i.e., how
                 the value of an object field is related to the value of
                 a neighboring object field. STARC executes the
                 predicate method on the structure and monitors its
                 execution to identify corrupt object fields, which
                 STARC then repairs using a systematic search of a
                 neighborhood of the given structure. Each repair action
                 is guided by the result of the static analysis, which
                 enables more efficient and effective repair compared to
                 prior work. Experimental results show that STARC can
                 repair structures with tens of thousands of nodes, up
                 to 100 times larger than prior work.\par

                 STARC efficiency is probably not practical for very
                 large data structures in deployed systems, but opens a
                 promising direction for future work.",

  abstract =     "Data races often result in unexpected and erroneous
                 behavior. In addition to causing data corruption and
                 leading programs to crash, the presence of data races
                 complicates the semantics of an execution which might
                 no longer be sequentially consistent. Motivated by
                 these observations, we have designed and implemented a
                 Java runtime system that monitors program executions
                 and throws a DataRaceException when a data race is
                 about to occur. Analogous to other runtime exceptions,
                 the DataRaceException provides two key benefits. First,
                 accesses causing race conditions are interrupted and
                 handled before they cause errors that may be difficult
                 to diagnose later. Second, if no DataRaceException is
                 thrown in an execution, it is guaranteed to be
                 sequentially consistent. This strong guarantee helps to
                 rule out many concurrency-related possibilities as the
                 cause of erroneous behavior. When a DataRaceException
                 is caught, the operation, thread, or program causing it
                 can be terminated gracefully. Alternatively, the
                 DataRaceException can serve as a conflict-detection
                 mechanism in optimistic uses of concurrency.\par

                 We start with the definition of data-race-free
                 executions in the Java memory model. We generalize this
                 definition to executions that use transactions in
                 addition to locks and volatile variables for
                 synchronization. We present a precise and efficient
                 algorithm for dynamically verifying that an execution
                 is free of data races. This algorithm generalizes the
                 Goldilocks algorithm for data-race detection by
                 handling transactions and providing the ability to
                 distinguish between read and write accesses. We have
                 implemented our algorithm and the DataRaceException in
                 the Kaffe Java Virtual Machine. We have evaluated our
                 system on a variety of publicly available Java
                 benchmarks and a few microbenchmarks that combine
                 lock-based and transaction-based synchronization. Our
                 experiments indicate that our implementation has
                 reasonable overhead. Therefore, we believe that in
                 addition to being a debugging tool, the
                 DataRaceException may be a viable mechanism to enforce
                 the safety of executions of multithreaded Java
                 programs.",

                 does not guarantee programmer controlled initialization
                 of fields. Instead, all fields are initialized to
                 default values (0 for scalars and null for non-scalars)
                 on allocation. This is in stark contrast to functional
                 languages, where all parts of an allocation are
                 initialized to programmer-provided values. These
                 choices have a direct impact on two main issues: 1) the
                 prevalence of null in object oriented languages (and
                 its general absence in functional languages), and 2)
                 the ability to initialize circular data structures.
                 This paper explores connections between these differing
                 approaches and proposes a fresh look at initialization.
                 Delayed types are introduced to express and formalize
                 prevalent initialization patterns in object-oriented
                 languages.",

                 for developing reliable, self-sustaining software
                 systems. Conscientious software systems consist of an
                 allopoietic part, which encapsulates application
                 functionality, and an autopoietic part that is
                 responsible for keeping the system alive by monitoring
                 the application and adapting it to environmental
                 changes. Practical application of the conscientious
                 software paradigm requires solutions to two open
                 problems: The design of suitable autopoietic
                 programming languages and the proposal of concrete
                 architectures for combining the autopoietic and
                 allopoietic parts. In this paper, we tackle the second
                 challenge, and propose a concrete, aspect-oriented
                 architecture for realizing conscientious software.
                 Here, we introduce epi-aspects, a construct for
                 upgrading new and existing applications into
                 conscientious software. This paper provides the
                 architectural design of epi-aspects, an autopoietic
                 simulator, and a concrete framework for developing
                 epi-aspects in Java. The framework and the simulator
                 are used to conduct a case study in which we develop
                 and test a conscientious Java application.",

                 Although reference objects are often helpful, they
                 introduce nondeterminism into program evaluation and

                 different garbage collection policy to each one of
                 them. Accordingly, weak references are given the
                 semantics of eager collection and soft references are
                 given the semantics of lazy collection. In addition, we

                 of our calculus by modeling a Java program which
                 addresses a commonly-encountered caching problem. Using
                 our model, we reason about the program's evaluation and

                 benchmark because it is affected by various factors
                 such as the Java application, its input, the virtual
                 machine, the garbage collector, the heap size, etc. In
                 addition, non-determinism at run-time causes the
                 execution time of a Java program to differ from run to
                 run. There are a number of sources of non-determinism
                 such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and optimization
                 in the virtual machine (VM) driven by timer-based
                 method sampling, thread scheduling, garbage collection,
                 and various.\par

                 There exist a wide variety of Java performance
                 evaluation methodologies used by researchers and
                 benchmarkers. These methodologies differ from each
                 other in a number of ways. Some report average
                 performance over a number of runs of the same
                 experiment; others report the best or second best
                 performance observed; yet others report the worst. Some
                 iterate the benchmark multiple times within a single VM
                 invocation; others consider multiple VM invocations and
                 iterate a single benchmark execution; yet others
                 consider multiple VM invocations and iterate the
                 benchmark multiple times.\par

                 This paper shows that prevalent methodologies can be
                 misleading, and can even lead to incorrect conclusions.
                 The reason is that the data analysis is not
                 statistically rigorous. In this paper, we present a
                 survey of existing Java performance evaluation
                 methodologies and discuss the importance of
                 statistically rigorous data analysis for dealing with
                 non-determinism. We advocate approaches to quantify
                 startup as well as steady-state performance, and, in
                 addition, we provide the JavaStats software to
                 automatically obtain performance numbers in a rigorous
                 manner. Although this paper focuses on Java performance
                 evaluation, many of the issues addressed in this paper
                 also apply to other programming languages and systems
                 that build on a managed runtime system.",

  abstract =     "Java's type system provides programmers with strong
                 guarantees of type and memory safety, but there are
                 many important properties not captured by standard Java
                 types. We describe JQual, a tool that adds user-defined
                 type qualifiers to Java, allowing programmers to
                 quickly and easily incorporate extra lightweight,
                 application-specific type checking into their programs.
                 JQual provides type qualifier inference, so that
                 programmers need only add a few key qualifier
                 annotations to their program, and then JQual infers any
                 remaining qualifiers and checks their consistency. We
                 explore two applications of JQual. First, we introduce
                 opaque and enum qualifiers to track C pointers and
                 enumerations that flow through Java code via the JNI.
                 In our benchmarks we found that these C values are
                 treated correctly, but there are some places where a

                 cache and TLB misses. The cache and TLB behavior
                 depends on the data layout of objects in memory. There
                 are many possible data layouts with different impacts
                 on performance, but it is not known which perform

                 be improved by ahead-of-time compiler (AOTC), which
                 translates bytecode into machine code in the server and
                 installs the machine code on the client device.
                 Although AOTC is more advantageous than just-in-time
                 compiler (JITC) due to its absence of the translation
                 overhead, AOTC cannot be applicable to dynamically
                 downloaded classes at runtime. This paper proposes
                 client-AOTC (c-AOTC) which performs AOTC on the client
                 device using the JITC module installed on the device,
                 complementing the server-AOTC. The machine code of a
                 method translated by JITC is cached on a persistent
                 memory of the device, and when the method is invoked
                 again in a later run of the program, the machine code
                 is loaded and executed directly without the translation
                 and interpretation overhead. One of major issues in
                 c-AOTC is relocation because some of the addresses used
                 by the cached machine code are not correct when the
                 machine code is loaded and used in a different run;
                 those addresses should be corrected before they are
                 used. Constant pool resolution and inlining complicate
                 the relocation problem and we propose our solutions. We
                 developed a c-AOTC on Sun's CDC VM reference
                 implementation (RI) and our evaluation results indicate
                 that c-AOTC can improve the performance significantly,
                 as much as an average of 12\%. We also experiment with
                 the issue of reducing the number of c-AOTC methods to
                 be cached when the persistent space is tight, with a
                 graceful degradation of performance.",

                 programming languages has been focusing on identifying
                 suitable features to support so-called scalable
                 extensibility, where the usual extension mechanism by
                 inheritance works in different scales of software
                 components-that is, classes, groups of classes, groups
                 of groups and so on. Its typing issues has usually been
                 addressed by means of dependent type systems, where
                 nested types are seen as properties of objects. In this
                 work, we seek instead for a different solution, which
                 can be more easily applied to Java-like languages, in
                 which nested types are considered properties of
                 classes.\par

                 We introduce the mechanism of variant path types, which
                 provide a flexible means to express intra-group
                 relationship (among classes) that has to be preserved
                 through extension. In particular, improving and
                 extending existing works on groups and exact types, we
                 feature the new notions of exact and inexact
                 qualifications, providing rich abstractions to express
                 various kinds of set of objects, with a flexible
                 subtyping scheme. We formalize a safe type system for
                 variant path types on top of Feather weight Java. Our
                 development results in a complete solution for scalable
                 extensibility, similarly to previous attempts based on
                 dependent type systems.",

  abstract =     "Since the introduction of object-oriented programming
                 few programming languages have attempted to provide
                 programmers with more than objects and classes, i.e.,
                 more than two levels. Those that did, almost
                 exclusively aimed at describing language
                 properties-i.e., their metaclasses exert linguistic
                 control on language concepts and mechanisms-often in
                 order to make the language extensible. In terms of
                 supporting logical domain classification levels,
                 however, they are still limited to two levels.\par

                 In this paper we conservatively extend the
                 object-oriented programming paradigm to feature an
                 unbounded number of domain classification levels. We
                 can therefore avoid the introduction of accidental
                 complexity into programs caused by accommodating
                 multiple domain levels within only two programming
                 levels. We present a corresponding language design
                 featuring ``deep instantiation'' and demonstrate its
                 features with a running example. Finally, we outline
                 the implementation of our compiler prototype and
                 discuss the potentials of further developing our
                 language design.",

                 considered the major weakness of reference counting.
                 Reference counted systems handle this problem by
                 incorporating either a global tracing collector, or a
                 'partial' tracing collector that considers only the
                 cycle candidates but needs several traces on them. In
                 particular, the latter has become a preferred one as it
                 has better scalability and locality (no need to scan
                 the entire heap). This paper presents a new
                 'lightweight' cyclic reference counting algorithm,
                 which is based on partial tracing and deals with the
                 cycle problem in a simpler and more efficient way. By
                 exploiting the lightweight hypothesis that considers a
                 single sub-graph, instead of individual cycles, as the
                 basic unit of cycle collection, the algorithm can
                 detect garbage cycles in a single trace. In addition,
                 we propose a technique for eliminating redundant scans
                 over garbage objects, thus improving the efficiency of
                 the algorithm. The pseudocode and its correctness proof
                 are also presented. Finally, an implementation based on

                 others, in particular field and argument ownership, are

                 the success of Microsoft's .NET and COM and Sun's JVM
                 show. Programming language designers are designing
                 programming languages that reflect that fact --- SML\#,
                 Mondrian, and Scala, to name just a few examples, all
                 treat interoperability with other languages as a
                 central design feature. Still, current multi-language
                 research tends not to focus on the semantics of
                 interoperation features, but only on how to implement
                 them efficiently. In this paper, we take first steps
                 toward higher-level models of interoperating systems.
                 Our technique abstracts away the low-level details of
                 interoperability like garbage collection and
                 representation coherence, and lets us focus on semantic
                 properties like type-safety and observable equivalence.
                 Beyond giving simple expressive models that are natural
                 compositions of single-language models, our studies
                 have uncovered several interesting facts about
                 interoperability. For example, higher-order contracts
                 naturally emerge as the glue to ensure that
                 interoperating languages respect each other's type
                 systems. While we present our results in an abstract
                 setting, they shed light on real multi-language systems

                 becoming more and more widely used in both high-end
                 software and real-time embedded applications. The
                 correctness of the GC implementation is essential to
                 the reliability and security of a large portion of the
                 world's mission-critical software. Unfortunately,
                 garbage collectors--especially incremental and
                 concurrent ones--are extremely hard to implement
                 correctly. In this paper, we present a new uniform
                 approach to verifying the safety of both a mutator and
                 its garbage collector in Hoare-style logic. We define a
                 formal garbage collector interface general enough to
                 reason about a variety of algorithms while allowing the
                 mutator to ignore implementation-specific details of
                 the collector. Our approach supports collectors that
                 require read and write barriers. We have used our
                 approach to mechanically verify assembly

                 copying GCs in Coq, as well as sample mutator programs
                 that can be linked with any of the GCs to produce a

                 provided by mainstream programming languages like Java
                 or standard implementations of C. The difficulty here
                 is that, for $w > 1$, the ring $Z_m$ of integers modulo
                 $m = 2^w$ has zero divisors and thus cannot be embedded
                 into a field. Not withstanding that, we present intra-
                 and interprocedural algorithms for inferring for every
                 program point u affine relations between program
                 variables valid at $u$. If conditional branching is
                 replaced with nondeterministic branching, our
                 algorithms are not only sound but also complete in that
                 they detect all valid affine relations in a natural
                 class of programs. Moreover, they run in time linear in
                 the program size and polynomial in the number of
                 program variables and can be implemented by using the
                 same modular integer arithmetic as the target language

  abstract =     "Speculative compiler optimizations are effective in
                 improving both single-thread performance and reducing
                 power consumption, but their implementation introduces
                 significant complexity, which can limit their adoption,
                 limit their optimization scope, and negatively impact
                 the reliability of the compilers that implement them.
                 To eliminate much of this complexity, as well as
                 increase the effectiveness of these optimizations, we
                 propose that microprocessors provide
                 architecturally-visible hardware primitives for atomic
                 execution. These primitives provide to the compiler the
                 ability to optimize the program's hot path in
                 isolation, allowing the use of non-speculative
                 formulations of optimization passes to perform
                 speculative optimizations. Atomic execution guarantees
                 that if a speculation invariant does not hold, the
                 speculative updates are discarded, the register state
                 is restored, and control is transferred to a
                 non-speculative version of the code, thereby relieving
                 the compiler from the responsibility of generating
                 compensation code.\par

                 We demonstrate the benefit of hardware atomicity in the
                 context of a Java virtual machine. We find
                 incorporating the notion of atomic regions into an
                 existing compiler intermediate representation to be
                 natural, requiring roughly 3,000 lines of code (~3\% of
                 a JVM's optimizing compiler), most of which were for
                 region formation. Its incorporation creates new
                 opportunities for existing optimization passes, as well
                 as greatly simplifying the implementation of additional
                 optimizations (e.g., partial inlining, partial loop
                 unrolling, and speculative lock elision). These
                 optimizations reduce dynamic instruction count by 11\%
                 on average and result in a 10-15\% average speedup,
                 relative to a baseline compiler with a similar degree

                 over-provisioning as well as time-varying resource
                 demands of typical enterprise applications. One
                 approach to increase resource utilization is to
                 consolidate applications in a shared infrastructure
                 using virtualization. Meeting application-level quality
                 of service (QoS) goals becomes a challenge in a
                 consolidated environment as application resource needs
                 differ. Furthermore, for multi-tier applications, the
                 amount of resources needed to achieve their QoS goals
                 might be different at each tier and may also depend on
                 availability of resources in other tiers. In this
                 paper, we develop an adaptive resource control system
                 that dynamically adjusts the resource shares to
                 individual tiers in order to meet application-level QoS
                 goals while achieving high resource utilization in the
                 data center. Our control system is developed using
                 classical control theory, and we used a black-box
                 system modeling approach to overcome the absence of
                 first principle models for complex enterprise
                 applications and systems. To evaluate our controllers,

                 site, and a two-tier Java implementation of TPC-W. Our

                 differs from other applications of AOP (e.g. tracing),
                 since it necessitates efficient and often complex
                 interactions with the target program. As such, it was
                 uncertain whether AspectJ could achieve this goal.
                 Therefore, we investigate four common profiling
                 problems (heap usage, object lifetime, wasted time and
                 time-spent) and report on how well AspectJ handles

                 describe the four profiling problems and reasonably
                 efficient in most cases. On the other hand, we find

                 statically prevents data races and deadlocks in
                 multithreaded programs. SafeJava is expressive enough
                 to support common programming patterns, its type
                 checking is fast and scalable, and it requires little
                 programming overhead. SafeJava thus offers a promising
                 approach for making multithreaded programs more
                 reliable. This paper presents a corresponding type
                 system extension for the Java virtual machine language
                 (JVML). We call the resulting language SafeJVML.
                 Well-typed SafeJVML programs are guaranteed to be free
                 of data races and deadlocks. Designing a corresponding
                 type system for JVML is important because most Java
                 code is shipped in the JVML format. Designing a
                 corresponding type system for JVML is nontrivial
                 because of important differences between Java and JVML.
                 In particular, the absence of block structure in JVML
                 programs and the fact that they do not use named local
                 variables the way Java programs do make the type
                 systems for Java and JVML significantly different. For
                 example, verifying absence of races and deadlocks in
                 JVML programs requires performing an alias analysis,
                 something that was not necessary for verifying absence
                 of races and deadlocks in Java programs. This paper
                 presents static and dynamic semantics for Safe JVML. It
                 also includes a proof that the SafeJVML type system is
                 sound and that it prevents data races and deadlocks. To
                 the best of our knowledge, this is the first type
                 system for JVML that statically ensures absence of

                 garbage collection, real-time programmers can partition
                 the heap into a number of heaplets and for each
                 partition choose to run a separate collector with a
                 schedule that matches the allocation behavior and
                 footprint of the real-time task using it. This approach
                 lowers worst-case response times of real-time
                 applications by 26\%, while almost doubling mutator
                 utilization -- all with only minimal changes to the
                 application code.",

                 Shield [Wang et al. 2004]. In this article, we take
                 Shield's vision to a new domain, inspecting and
                 cleansing not just static content, but also dynamic
                 content. The dynamic content we target is the dynamic
                 HTML in Web pages, which have become a popular vector
                 for attacks. The key challenge in filtering dynamic
                 HTML is that it is undecidable to statically determine
                 whether an embedded script will exploit the browser at
                 runtime. We avoid this undecidability problem by
                 rewriting web pages and any embedded scripts into safe
                 equivalents, inserting checks so that the filtering is
                 done at runtime. The rewritten pages contain logic for
                 recursively applying runtime checks to dynamically
                 generated or modified web content, based on known
                 vulnerabilities. We have built and evaluated {\em

                 dynamic instrumentation of embedded scripts, and that
                 admits policies for customized runtime actions like
                 vulnerability-driven filtering. We also explore other

                 OSGi is a business standard for the life cycle
                 management of Java software components. It is based on
                 a service oriented architecture where functional units
                 are decoupled and components can be managed
                 independently of each other. However, the focus
                 continuously shifts from the originally intended area
                 of small and embedded devices towards large-scaled
                 enterprise systems. As a result, implementations of the
                 OSGi framework are increasingly becoming more
                 heavyweight and less suitable for smaller computing
                 devices. In this paper, we describe the experience

                 resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive benchmarks

                 to consider as a conceptual unit, including features,
                 nonfunctional requirements, and design idioms. In many
                 cases, the source code implementing a concern is not
                 encapsulated in a single programming language module,
                 and is instead scattered and tangled throughout a
                 system. Inadequate separation of concerns increases the
                 difficulty of evolving software in a correct and
                 cost-effective manner. To make it easier to modify
                 concerns that are not well modularized, we propose an
                 approach in which the implementation of concerns is
                 documented in artifacts, called concern graphs. Concern
                 graphs are abstract models that describe which parts of

  abstract =     "Developing a general component system for a statically
                 typed, object-oriented language is a challenging design
                 problem for two reasons. First, mutually recursive
                 references across components are common in
                 object-oriented programs --- an issue that has proven
                 troublesome in the context of component systems for
                 functional and procedural languages. Second,
                 inheritance across component boundaries can cause
                 accidental method overrides. Our recent research shows
                 that a component framework can be constructed for a
                 nominally typed object-oriented language supporting
                 first-class generic types simply by adding appropriate
                 annotations, syntactic sugar, and component-level
                 type-checking. The fundamental semantic building blocks
                 for constructing, type-checking and manipulating
                 components are provided by the underlying first-class
                 generic type system. To demonstrate the simplicity and
                 utility of this approach we have designed and
                 implemented an extension of Java called Component
                 NEXTGEN (CGEN). CGEN, which is based on the Sun Java
                 5.0 javac compiler, is backwards compatible with
                 existing Java binary code and runs on current Java
                 Virtual Machines.\par

                 The primary contribution of this paper is a technical
                 analysis of the subtle design issues involved in
                 building a component framework for a nominally typed
                 object-oriented language supporting first-class
                 generics. In contrast to component systems for
                 structurally typed languages, mutual recursion among
                 components is accommodated in the type system and
                 semantics without incorporating any special machinery.
                 Our analysis includes a presentation of Core CGEN
                 (CCG), a small, core language modeling the CGEN
                 framework. It is based on Featherweight GJ and
                 incorporates some ideas from MIXGEN. CCG adds the
                 essential features to support components, but nothing
                 more. Our discussion includes the type rules and
                 semantics for CCG, as well as a proof of type safety.",

                 additional source of information that a compiler may

                 position to make use of such information because it is

                 As hardware platforms become more and more complex, it

                 sufficient information about the execution platform.
                 Machine-level performance data obtained from a hardware
                 performance monitor can not only direct the compiler to
                 those parts of the program that deserve its attention
                 but also determine if an optimization step actually
                 improved the performance of the application.\par

                 This paper presents an infrastructure based on a
                 dynamic compiler+runtime environment for Java that
                 incorporates machine-level information as an additional
                 kind of feedback for the compiler and runtime
                 environment. The low-overhead monitoring system
                 provides fine-grained performance data that can be
                 tracked back to individual Java bytecode instructions.
                 As an example, the paper presents results for object
                 co-allocation in a generational garbage collector that
                 optimizes spatial locality of objects on-line using
                 measurements about cache misses. In the best case, the
                 execution time is reduced by 14\% and L1 cache misses
                 by 28\%.",

                 full-scale programming language, despite the many
                 potential benefits. Partly this is because the
                 available metalanguages for expressing semantics -
                 usually either L$^a$ T$_E$ X for informal mathematics,
                 or the formal mathematics of a proof assistant - make
                 it much harder than necessary to work with large
                 definitions.\par

                 We present a metalanguage specifically designed for
                 this problem, and a tool, ott, that sanity-checks such
                 definitions and compiles them into proof assistant code
                 for Coq, HOL, Isabelle, and (in progress) Twelf,
                 together with L$^a$ T$_E$ X code for production-quality
                 typesetting, and OCaml boilerplate. The main
                 innovations are:(1) metalanguage design to make
                 definitions concise, and easy to read and edit;(2) an
                 expressive but intuitive metalanguage for specifying
                 binding structures; and (3) compilation to proof
                 assistant code.\par

                 This has been tested in substantial case studies,
                 including modular specifications of calculi from the
                 TAPL text, a Lightweight Java with Java JSR 277/294
                 module system proposals, and a large fragment of OCaml
                 (around 306 rules), with machine proofs of various
                 soundness results. Our aim with this work is to enable
                 a phase change: making it feasible to work routinely,
                 without heroic effort, with rigorous semantic

                 control mechanism that avoids many of the pitfalls of
                 lock-based synchronization. High-performance software
                 transactional memory (STM) implementations thus far
                 provide weak atomicity: Accessing shared data both
                 inside and outside a transaction can result in
                 unexpected, implementation-dependent behavior. To
                 guarantee isolation and consistent ordering in such a
                 system, programmers are expected to enclose all
                 shared-memory accesses inside transactions.\par

                 A system that provides strong atomicity guarantees
                 isolation even in the presence of threads that access
                 shared data outside transactions. A strongly-atomic

                 demonstrate how to implement non-transactional data
                 accesses via efficient read and write barriers, and we
                 present compiler optimizations that further reduce the
                 overheads of these barriers. We introduce a dynamic
                 escape analysis that differentiates private and public
                 data at runtime to make barriers cheaper and a static
                 not-accessed-in-transaction analysis that removes many
                 barriers completely. Our results on a set of Java

                 coarse-grained parallelism in applications that must
                 process continuous sequences of events. The appeal of
                 stream programming comes from its conceptual
                 simplicity. A program is a collection of independent
                 filters which communicate by the means of
                 uni-directional data channels. This model lends itself
                 naturally to concurrent and efficient implementations
                 on modern multiprocessors. As the output behavior of
                 filters is determined by the state of their input
                 channels, stream programs have fewer opportunities for
                 the errors (such as data races and deadlocks) that
                 plague shared memory concurrent programming. This paper
                 introduces StreamFlex, an extension to Java which
                 marries streams with objects and thus enables to
                 combine, in the same Java virtual machine, stream
                 processing code with traditional object-oriented
                 components. StreamFlex targets high-throughput
                 low-latency applications with stringent
                 quality-of-service requirements. To achieve these
                 goals, it must, at the same time, extend and restrict
                 Java. To allow for program optimization and provide
                 latency guarantees, the StreamFlex compiler restricts
                 Java by imposing a stricter typing discipline on
                 filters. On the other hand, StreamFlex extends the Java
                 virtual machine with real-time capabilities,
                 transactional memory and type-safe region-based
                 allocation. The result is a rich and expressive

  abstract =     "Program slicing systematically identifies parts of a
                 program relevant to a seed statement. Unfortunately,
                 slices of modern programs often grow too large for
                 human consumption. We argue that unwieldy slices arise
                 primarily from an overly broad definition of relevance,
                 rather than from analysis imprecision. While a
                 traditional slice includes all statements that may
                 affect a point of interest, not all such statements
                 appear equally relevant to a human.\par

                 As an improved method of finding relevant statements,
                 we propose thin slicing. A thin slice consists only of
                 producer statements for the seed, i.e., those
                 statements that help compute and copy a value to the
                 seed. Statements that explain why producers affect the
                 seed are excluded. For example, for a seed that reads a
                 value from a container object, a thin slice includes
                 statements that store the value into the container, but
                 excludes statements that manipulate pointers to the
                 container itself. Thin slices can also be
                 hierarchically expanded to include statements
                 explaining how producers affect the seed, yielding a
                 traditional slice in the limit.\par

                 We evaluated thin slicing for a set of debugging and
                 program understanding tasks. The evaluation showed that
                 thin slices usually included the desired statements for
                 the tasks (e.g., the buggy statement for a debugging
                 task). Furthermore, in simulated use of a slicing tool,
                 thin slices revealed desired statements after
                 inspecting 3.3 times fewer statements than traditional
                 slicing for our debugging tasks and 9.4 times fewer
                 statements for our program understanding tasks.
                 Finally, our thin slicing algorithm scales well to
                 relatively large Java benchmarks, suggesting that thin
                 slicing represents an attractive option for practical
                 tools.",

                 implementation mistakes that can lead to exploits and
                 failures; Java compilers perform static analysis for
                 optimization. If Java programs contain foreign function
                 calls to C libraries, however, static analysis is
                 forced to make either optimistic or pessimistic
                 assumptions about the foreign function calls, since
                 models of the C libraries are typically not
                 available.\par

                 We propose ILEA (stands for Inter-LanguagE Analysis),
                 which is a framework that enables existing Java
                 analyses to understand the behavior of C code. Our
                 framework includes: (1) a novel specification language,
                 which extends the Java Virtual Machine Language (JVML)
                 with a few primitives that approximate the effects that
                 the C code might have; (2) an automatic specification
                 extractor, which builds models of the C code. Comparing
                 to other possible specification languages, our language
                 is expressive, yet facilitates construction of
                 automatic specification extractors. Furthermore,
                 because the specification language is based on the
                 JVML, existing Java analyses can be easily migrated to
                 utilize specifications in the language. We also
                 demonstrate the utility of the specifications
                 generated, by modifying an existing non-null analysis
                 to identify null-related bugs in Java applications that
                 contain C libraries. Our preliminary experiments
                 identified dozens of null-related bugs.",

  abstract =     "Embedded systems pose unique challenges to Java
                 application developers and virtual machine designers.
                 Chief among these challenges is the memory footprint of
                 both the virtual machine and the applications that run
                 within it. With the rapidly increasing set of features
                 provided by the Java language, virtual machine
                 designers are often forced to build custom
                 implementations that make various tradeoffs between the
                 footprint of the virtual machine and the subset of the
                 Java language and class libraries that are supported.
                 In this paper, we present the ExoVM, a system in which
                 an application is initialized in a fully featured
                 virtual machine, and then the code, data, and virtual
                 machine features necessary to execute it are packaged
                 into a binary image. Key to this process is feature
                 analysis, a technique for computing the reachable code
                 and data of a Java program and its implementation
                 inside the VM simultaneously. The ExoVM reduces the
                 need to develop customized embedded virtual machines by
                 reusing a single VM infrastructure and automatically
                 eliding the implementation of unused Java features on a
                 per-program basis. We present a constraint-based
                 instantiation of the analysis technique, an
                 implementation in IBM's J9 Java VM, experiments
                 evaluating our technique for the EEMBC benchmark suite,
                 and some discussion of the individual costs of some of
                 Java's features. Our evaluation shows that our system
                 can reduce the non-heap memory allocation of the
                 virtual machine by as much as 75\%. We discuss VM and
                 language design decisions that our work shows are
                 important in targeting embedded systems, supporting the
                 long-term goal of a common VM infrastructure spanning

                 contemporary computer systems given the huge
                 processor/memory speed gap. This paper proposes a
                 space-efficient Java object model for reducing the
                 memory consumption of 64-bit Java virtual machines. We
                 completely eliminate the object header through typed
                 virtual addressing (TVA) or implicit typing. TVA
                 encodes the object type in the object's virtual address
                 by allocating all objects of a given type in a
                 contiguous memory segment. This allows for removing the
                 type information as well as the status field from the
                 object header. Whenever type and status information is
                 needed, masking is applied to the object's virtual
                 address for obtaining an offset into type and status
                 information structures. Unlike previous work on
                 implicit typing, we apply TVA to a selected number of
                 frequently allocated object types, hence, the name
                 selective TVA (STVA); this limits the amount of memory
                 fragmentation. In addition to applying STVA, we also
                 compress the type information block (TIB) pointers for
                 all objects that do not fall under TVA. We implement
                 the space-efficient Java object model in the 64-bit
                 version of the Jikes RVM on an AIX IBM platform and
                 compare its performance against the traditionally used
                 Java object model using a multitude of Java benchmarks.
                 We conclude that the space-efficient Java object model
                 reduces memory consumption by on average 15\% (and up
                 to 45\% for some benchmarks). About one-half the
                 reduction comes from TIB pointer compression; the other
                 one-half comes from STVA. In terms of performance, the
                 space-efficient object model generally does not affect
                 performance; however, for some benchmarks we observe
                 statistically significant performance speedups, up to
                 20\%.",

                 queries in response to client requests and execute
                 them. Java servlets, for example, can create strings
                 that represent SQL queries and then send the queries,
                 using JDBC, to a database server for execution. The
                 servlet programmer enjoys static checking via Java's
                 strong type system. However, the Java type system does
                 little to check for possible errors in the dynamically
                 generated SQL query strings. Thus, a type error in a
                 generated selection query (e.g., comparing a string
                 attribute with an integer) can result in an SQL runtime
                 exception. Currently, such defects must be rooted out

                 Untrusted JavaScript code goes through a rewriting

                 obstacle for making Java a viable database programming
                 language. Regrettably, a recently accepted solution for
                 genericity in Java 5.0 has far-reaching negative
                 implications for persistent and database systems
                 because of static and dynamic type violations. Severe
                 implications occur in typical database transactions
                 when processing a variety of database collections.
                 Well-known approaches to persistence in Java, including
                 Java's own persistence mechanism, do not perform
                 correctly due to incorrect dynamic type information
                 that gets promoted to persistence along with objects.
                 Dynamic checking of types of objects fetched from the
                 persistent store may now lead to unexpected type
                 violations. Further problems occur in reflective
                 transactions as Java Core Reflection now allows dynamic
                 type violations without detecting them or throwing
                 standard exceptions. All of this shows that extending
                 Java with parametric polymorphism has not made Java a
                 more viable database programming language. Both legacy
                 systems, such as those based on the Java binding of the
                 ODMG or JDO, and future Java-related persistent and
                 database technologies will be affected. The source of
                 these problems is in an implementation idiom called
                 type erasure. This paper provides formal proofs of the
                 above implications of type erasure along with specific
                 samples of code in Java 5.0 illustrating these
                 violations. The limitations of the virtual platform and
                 extensions required for persistent systems to solve
                 this problem are also elaborated.",

  abstract =     "Coping with software defects that occur in the
                 post-deployment stage is a challenging problem: bugs
                 may occur only when the system uses a specific
                 configuration and only under certain usage scenarios.
                 Nevertheless, halting production systems until the bug
                 is tracked and fixed is often impossible. Thus,
                 developers have to try to reproduce the bug in
                 laboratory conditions. Often the reproduction of the
                 bug consists of the lion share of the debugging
                 effort.\par

                 In this paper we suggest an approach to address the
                 aforementioned problem by using a specialized runtime
                 environment (QVM, for {\em Quality Virtual Machine\/}).
                 QVM efficiently detects defects by continuously
                 monitoring the execution of the application in a
                 production setting. QVM enables the efficient checking
                 of violations of user-specified correctness properties,
                 e.g., typestate safety properties, Java assertions, and
                 heap properties pertaining to ownership.\par

                 QVM is markedly different from existing techniques for
                 continuous monitoring by using a novel overhead manager
                 which enforces a user-specified overhead budget for
                 quality checks. Existing tools for error detection in
                 the field usually disrupt the operation of the deployed
                 system. QVM, on the other hand, provides a balanced
                 trade off between the cost of the monitoring process
                 and the maintenance of sufficient accuracy for
                 detecting defects. Specifically, the overhead cost of
                 using QVM instead of a standard JVM, is low enough to
                 be acceptable in production environments.\par

                 We implemented QVM on top of IBM's J9 Java Virtual
                 Machine and used it to detect and fix various errors in
                 real-world applications.",

                 rise to a variety of language extensions that place

                 reductions in latency and jitter. However, each model

  abstract =     "Energy consumption is one of the most important issues
                 in resource-constrained embedded systems. Many such
                 systems run Java-based applications due to Java's
                 architecture-independent format (bytecode). Standard
                 techniques for executing bytecode programs, e.g.
                 interpretation or just-in-time compilation, have
                 performance or memory issues that make them unsuitable
                 for resource-constrained embedded systems.\par

                 A superoperator-extended, lightweight Java Virtual
                 Machine (JVM) can be used in resource-constrained
                 embedded systems to improve performance and reduce
                 memory consumption. This paper shows that such a JVM
                 also significantly reduces energy consumption. This is
                 due primarily to a considerable reduction in the number
                 of memory accesses and thus in energy consumption in
                 the instruction and data TLBs and caches and, in most
                 cases, in DRAM energy consumption. Since the fraction
                 of processor energy dissipated in these units is
                 approximately 60\%, the energy savings achieved are
                 significant.\par

                 The paper evaluates the number of load, store, and
                 computational instructions eliminated by the use of
                 proposed superoperators as compared to a simple
                 interpreter on a set of embedded benchmarks. Using
                 cache and DRAM per access energy we estimate the total
                 processor/DRAM energy saved by using our JVM. Our
                 results show that with 32KB caches the reduction in
                 energy consumption ranges from 40\% to 60\% of the
                 overall processor, plus DRAM energy. Even higher
                 savings may be achieved with smaller caches and
                 increased access to DRAM as DRAM access energy is
                 fairly high.",

  abstract =     "After more than 10 years, Aspect-Oriented Programming
                 (AOP) is still a controversial idea. While the concept
                 of aspects appeals to everyone's intuitions, concrete
                 AOP solutions often fail to convince researchers and
                 practitioners alike. This discrepancy results in part
                 from a lack of an adequate theory of aspects, which in
                 turn leads to the development of AOP solutions that are
                 useful in limited situations.\par

                 We propose a new theory of aspects that can be
                 summarized as follows: concerns are latent topics that
                 can be automatically extracted using statistical topic
                 modeling techniques adapted to software. Software
                 scattering and tangling can be measured precisely by
                 the entropies of the underlying topic-over-files and
                 files-over-topics distributions. Aspects are latent
                 topics with high scattering entropy.\par

                 The theory is validated empirically on both the large
                 scale, with a study of 4,632 Java projects, and the
                 small scale, with a study of 5 individual projects.
                 From these analyses, we identify two dozen topics that
                 emerge as general-purpose aspects across multiple
                 projects, as well as project-specific topics/concerns.
                 The approach is also shown to produce results that are
                 compatible with previous methods for identifying
                 aspects, and also extends them.\par

                 Our work provides not only a concrete approach for
                 identifying aspects at several scales in an
                 unsupervised manner but, more importantly, a
                 formulation of AOP grounded in information theory. The
                 understanding of aspects under this new perspective
                 makes additional progress toward the design of models

                 bytecode is the first step of any serious tool that
                 manipulates bytecode, be it for decompilation,
                 transformation or analysis. It is important, therefore,
                 to perform that step as accurately and efficiently as
                 possible. Previous work has sought to give solutions
                 with good worst-case complexity.\par

                 We present a novel algorithm, which is optimised for
                 the common case rather than worst-case performance. It
                 works by first finding a set of minimal typings that
                 are valid for all assignments, and then checking
                 whether these minimal typings satisfy all uses. Unlike
                 previous algorithms, it does not explicitly build a
                 data structure of type constraints, and it is easy to
                 implement efficiently. We prove that the algorithm
                 produces a typing that is both sound (obeying the rules
                 of the language) and as tight as possible.\par

                 We then go on to present extensive experiments,
                 comparing the results of the new algorithm against the
                 previously best known method. The experiments include
                 bytecode that is generated in other ways than
                 compilation of Java source. The new algorithm is always
                 faster, typically by a factor 6, but on some real
                 benchmarks the gain is as high as a factor of 92.
                 Furthermore, whereas that previous method is sometimes
                 suboptimal, our algorithm always returns a tightest
                 possible type.\par

                 We also discuss in detail how we handle primitive
                 types, which is a difficult issue due to the
                 discrepancy in their treatment between Java bytecode
                 and Java source. For the application to decompilation,
                 however, it is very important to handle this

                 However, separate, or modular, code generation, though
                 largely used in existing compilers and particularly in
                 industrial ones, has never been precisely described or
                 entirely formalized. Such a formalization is now

                 present a concise clock-directed translation from the
                 source to this intermediate language. We address the

                 We describe an effort, currently nearing completion, to
                 address these issues by explicitly providing semantics
                 for threads in the next revision of the C++ standard.
                 Our approach is similar to that recently followed by
                 Java [25], in that, at least for a well-defined and
                 interesting subset of the language, we give
                 sequentially consistent semantics to programs that do
                 not contain data races. Nonetheless, a number of our
                 decisions are often surprising even to those familiar
                 with the Java effort:\par

                 We (mostly) insist on sequential consistency for
                 race-free programs, in spite of implementation issues
                 that came to light after the Java work.\par

                 We give no semantics to programs with data races. There
                 are no benign C++ data races.\par

                 We use weaker semantics for trylock than existing
                 languages or libraries, allowing us to promise
                 sequential consistency with an intuitive race
                 definition, even for programs with trylock.\par

                 This paper describes the simple model we would like to
                 be able to provide for C++ threads programmers, and
                 explain how this, together with some practical, but
                 often under-appreciated implementation constraints,
                 drives us towards the above decisions.",

                 objects. Unfortunately, a program still leaks memory if
                 it maintains references to objects it will never use

                 increase garbage collection frequency and workload. A
                 growing leak will eventually exhaust memory and crash

                 This paper introduces a {\em leak tolerance\/} approach
                 called {\em Melt\/} that safely eliminates performance
                 degradations and crashes due to leaks of dead but
                 reachable objects in managed languages, given
                 sufficient disk space to hold leaking objects. Melt (1)
                 identifies {\em stale\/} objects that the program is
                 not accessing; (2) segregates in-use and stale objects

                 subsequently accesses them. We design and build a
                 prototype implementation of Melt in a Java VM and show
                 it adds overhead low enough for production systems.
                 Whereas existing VMs grind to a halt and then crash on
                 programs with leaks, Melt keeps many of these programs
                 running much longer without significantly degrading
                 performance. Melt provides users the illusion of a

  abstract =     "One scarce resource in embedded systems is memory.
                 Multitasking makes the lack of memory problem even
                 worse. Most current embedded systems, which do not
                 provide virtual memory, simply divide physical memory
                 and evenly assign contiguous memory chunks to multiple
                 applications. Such simple memory management can
                 frequently cause the lack of available memory for some
                 applications, while others are not using the full
                 amount of assigned memory. To overcome inefficiency in
                 current memory management, we present an efficient heap
                 management scheme that allows multiple applications to
                 share heap space. To reduce overall heap memory usage,
                 applications adaptively acquire subheaps out of shared
                 pool of memory and release surplus subheaps to shared
                 pool. As a result, applications see noncontiguous
                 multiple subheaps as a heap in their address space. We
                 target Java applications to implement our heap-sharing
                 scheme in the KVM from Sun Microsystems. To protect
                 fragmented heap space with a limited number of regions
                 in memory protection unit (MPU), we maintain only a
                 limited number of subheaps. We experimentally evaluate
                 our heap management scheme with J2ME MIDP applications.
                 Our static and dynamic schemes reduce heap memory
                 usage, on average, by 30 and 27\%, respectively. For
                 both schemes, overheads are kept low. The execution
                 times in our schemes are increased only by 0.01\% for
                 static scheme and 0.35\% for dynamic scheme, on

                 implementation of object-oriented programming
                 languages. Many techniques have been proposed, but none
                 of them perfectly fulfills the five requirements that
                 we have identified: constant-time, linear-space,
                 multiple inheritance, dynamic loading and inlining. In
                 this article, we propose a subtyping test
                 implementation that involves a combination of usual
                 hashtables and Cohen's display, which is a well-known
                 technique for single inheritance hierarchies. This
                 novel approach is based on {\em perfect hashing}, that
                 is, an optimized and truly constant-time variant of
                 hashing that applies to {\em immutable\/} hashtables.
                 We show that the resulting technique closely meets all
                 five requirements. Furthermore, in the framework of
                 Java-like languages --- characterized by single
                 inheritance of classes and multiple subtyping of
                 interfaces --- perfect hashing also applies to method
                 invocation when the receiver is typed by an interface.
                 The proposed technique is compared to some
                 alternatives, including the proposal by Palacz and
                 Vitek [2003]. Time-efficiency is assessed at the cycle

                 linear-space criterion is validated by statistical

                 execution in which the actions of the method are not

  abstract =     "Foreign function interfaces (FFIs) allow components in
                 different languages to communicate directly with each
                 other. While FFIs are useful, they often require
                 writing tricky low-level code and include little or no
                 static safety checking, thus providing a rich source of
                 hard-to-find programming errors. In this article, we
                 study the problem of enforcing type safety across the
                 OCaml-to-C FFI and the Java Native Interface (JNI). We
                 present O-Saffire and J-Saffire, a pair of multilingual
                 type inference systems that ensure C code that uses
                 these FFIs accesses high-level data safely. Our
                 inference systems use {\em representational types\/} to
                 model C's low-level view of OCaml and Java values, and
                 singleton types to track integers, strings, memory
                 offsets, and type tags through C. J-Saffire, our Java
                 system, uses a polymorphic flow-insensitive,
                 unification-based analysis. Polymorphism is important
                 because it allows us to precisely model user-defined
                 wrapper functions and the more than 200 JNI functions.
                 O-Saffire, our OCaml system, uses a monomorphic
                 flow-sensitive analysis because, while polymorphism is
                 much less important for the OCaml FFI flow-sensitivity
                 is critical to track conditional branches, which are
                 used when pattern matching OCaml data in C. O-Saffire
                 also tracks garbage collection information to ensure
                 that local C pointers to the OCaml heap are registered
                 properly, which is not necessary for the JNI. We have
                 applied O-Saffire and J-Saffire to a set of benchmarks
                 and found many bugs and questionable coding practices.
                 These results suggest that static checking of FFIs can
                 be a valuable tool in writing correct multilingual

                 type safety because temporary variables in the JVM are

                 analysis of electromagnetic (EM) waves emanating from
                 the wireless device during a cryptographic computation
                 do leak sufficient information, it may be possible for
                 an attacker to reconstruct the secret key. Possession

                 wireless communications insecure and cause further
                 potential problems, such as identity theft. Despite the

                 virtual machine, is non-trivial to benchmark. Java
                 performance is affected in various complex ways by the
                 application and its input, as well as by the virtual
                 machine (JIT optimizer, garbage collector, thread
                 scheduler, etc.). In addition, non-determinism due to
                 timer-based sampling for JIT optimization, thread
                 scheduling, and various system effects further
                 complicate the Java performance benchmarking
                 process.\par

                 Replay compilation is a recently introduced Java
                 performance analysis methodology that aims at
                 controlling non-determinism to improve experimental
                 repeatability. The key idea of replay compilation is to
                 control the compilation load during experimentation by
                 inducing a pre-recorded compilation plan at replay
                 time. Replay compilation also enables teasing apart
                 performance effects of the application versus the
                 virtual machine.\par

                 This paper argues that in contrast to current practice
                 which uses a single compilation plan at replay time,
                 multiple compilation plans add statistical rigor to the
                 replay compilation methodology. By doing so, replay
                 compilation better accounts for the variability
                 observed in compilation load across compilation plans.
                 In addition, we propose matched-pair comparison for
                 statistical data analysis. Matched-pair comparison
                 considers the performance measurements per compilation
                 plan before and after an innovation of interest as a
                 pair, which enables limiting the number of compilation
                 plans needed for accurate performance analysis compared
                 to statistical analysis assuming unpaired
                 measurements.",

                 generation, based on symbolic execution and constraint
                 solving, designed for security testing of large
                 applications. Unfortunately, the current effectiveness
                 of whitebox fuzzing is limited when testing
                 applications with highly-structured inputs, such as
                 compilers and interpreters. These applications process
                 their inputs in stages, such as lexing, parsing and
                 evaluation. Due to the enormous number of control paths
                 in early processing stages, whitebox fuzzing rarely
                 reaches parts of the application beyond those first
                 stages.\par

                 In this paper, we study how to enhance whitebox fuzzing
                 of complex structured-input applications with a
                 grammar-based specification of their valid inputs. We
                 present a novel dynamic test generation algorithm where
                 symbolic execution directly generates grammar-based
                 constraints whose satisfiability is checked using a
                 custom grammar-based constraint solver. We have
                 implemented this algorithm and evaluated it on a large
                 security-critical application, the JavaScript
                 interpreter of Internet Explorer 7 (IE7). Results of
                 our experiments show that grammar-based whitebox
                 fuzzing explores deeper program paths and avoids
                 dead-ends due to non-parsable inputs. Compared to
                 regular whitebox fuzzing, grammar-based whitebox
                 fuzzing increased coverage of the code generation
                 module of the IE7 JavaScript interpreter from 53\% to
                 81\% while using three times fewer tests.",

  abstract =     "Modern programs make extensive use of reusable
                 software libraries. For example, a study of a number of
                 large Java applications shows that between 17\% and
                 30\% of the classes in those applications use container
                 classes defined in the {\tt java.util} package. Given
                 this extensive code reuse in Java programs, it is
                 important for the interfaces of reusable classes to be
                 well documented. An interface is well documented if it
                 satisfies the following requirements: (1) the
                 documentation completely describes how to use the
                 interface; (2) the documentation is clear; (3) the
                 documentation is unambiguous; and (4) any deviation
                 between the documentation and the code is machine
                 detectable. Unfortunately, documentation in natural
                 language, which is the norm, does not satisfy the above
                 requirements. Formal specifications can satisfy them
                 but they are difficult to develop, requiring
                 significant effort on the part of programmers.\par

                 To address the practical difficulties with formal
                 specifications, we describe and evaluate a tool to help
                 programmers write and debug algebraic specifications.
                 Given an algebraic specification of a class, our
                 interpreter generates a prototype that can be used
                 within an application like a regular Java class. When
                 running an application that uses the prototype, the
                 interpreter prints error messages that tell the
                 developer in which way the specification is incomplete
                 or inconsistent with a hand-coded implementation of the
                 class. We use case studies to demonstrate the

                 AspectJ programs using code templates. MAJ itself is an
                 extension of Java, so users can interleave arbitrary
                 Java code with AspectJ code templates. MAJ is a
                 structured metaprogramming tool: a well-typed generator
                 implies a syntactically correct generated program. MAJ
                 promotes a methodology that combines aspect-oriented
                 and generative programming. A valuable application is
                 in implementing small domain-specific language
                 extensions as generators using unobtrusive annotations
                 for syntax extension and AspectJ as a back-end. The
                 advantages of this approach are twofold. First, the
                 generator integrates into an existing software
                 application much as a regular API or library, instead
                 of as a language extension. Second, a mature language
                 implementation is easy to achieve with little effort
                 since AspectJ takes care of the low-level issues of
                 interfacing with the base Java language.\par

                 In addition to its practical value, MAJ offers valuable
                 insights to metaprogramming tool designers. It is a
                 mature metaprogramming tool for AspectJ (and, by
                 extension, Java): a lot of emphasis has been placed on
                 context-sensitive parsing and error reporting. As a
                 result, MAJ minimizes the number of metaprogramming
                 (quote/unquote) operators and uses type inference to
                 reduce the need to remember type names for syntactic

  abstract =     "Recently, language extensions have been proposed for
                 Java and C\# to support pattern-based reflective
                 declaration. These extensions introduce a disciplined
                 form of meta-programming and aspect-oriented
                 programming to mainstream languages: They allow members
                 of a class (i.e., fields and methods) to be declared by
                 statically iterating over and pattern-matching on
                 members of other classes. Such techniques, however,
                 have been unable to safely express simple, but common,
                 idioms such as declaring getter and setter methods for
                 fields.\par

                 In this paper, we present a mechanism that addresses
                 the lack of expressiveness in past work without
                 sacrificing safety. Our technique is based on the idea
                 of nested patterns that elaborate the outer-most
                 pattern with blocking or enabling conditions. We
                 implemented this mechanism in a language, MorphJ. We
                 demonstrate the expressiveness of MorphJ with
                 real-world applications. In particular, the MorphJ
                 reimplementation of DSTM2, a software transactional
                 memory library, reduces 1,107 lines of Java reflection
                 and bytecode engineering library calls to just 374
                 lines of MorphJ code. At the same time, the MorphJ
                 solution is both high level and safer, as MorphJ can
                 separately type check generic classes and catch errors
                 early. We present and formalize the MorphJ type system,
                 and offer a type-checking algorithm.",

                 regime (or {\em programming model\/}) that rules out
                 data races, and enables local reasoning in the presence
                 of object aliasing and concurrency. Our programming

                 increasingly-common programming constructs such as
                 virtual function calls, switch-case statements, jump
                 tables, and interface calls. The performance impact of
                 indirect jumps is likely to increase because indirect
                 jumps with multiple targets are difficult to predict
                 even with specialized hardware.\par

                 This paper proposes a new way of handling
                 hard-to-predict indirect jumps: dynamically predicating
                 them. The compiler (static or dynamic) identifies
                 indirect jumps that are suitable for predication along
                 with their control-flow merge (CFM) points. The
                 hardware predicates the instructions between different
                 targets of the jump and its CFM point if the jump turns
                 out to be hard-to-predict at run time. If the jump
                 would actually have been mispredicted, its dynamic
                 predication eliminates a pipeline flush, thereby
                 improving performance.\par

  abstract =     "This paper describes a novel approach to reduce the
                 memory consumption of Java programs, by focusing on
                 their 'string memory inefficiencies'. In recent Java
                 applications, string data occupies a large amount of
                 the heap area. For example, about 40\% of the live heap
                 area is used for string data when a production J2EE
                 application server is running. By investigating the
                 string data in the live heap, we identified two types
                 of memory inefficiencies -- 'duplication' and 'unused
                 literals'. In the heap, there are many string objects
                 that have the same values. There also exist many string
                 literals whose values are not actually used by the
                 application. Since these inefficiencies exist as live
                 objects, they cannot be eliminated by existing garbage
                 collection techniques, which only remove dead objects.
                 Quantitative analysis of Java heaps in real
                 applications revealed that more than 50\% of the string
                 data in the live heap is wasted by these
                 inefficiencies. To reduce the string memory
                 inefficiencies, this paper proposes two techniques at
                 the Java virtual machine level, 'StringGC' for
                 eliminating duplicated strings at the time of garbage
                 collection, and 'Lazy Body Creation' for delaying part
                 of the literal instantiation until the literal's value
                 is actually used. We also present an interesting
                 technique at the Java program level, which we call
                 'BundleConverter', for preventing unused message
                 literals from being instantiated. Prototype
                 implementations on a production Java virtual machine
                 have achieved about 18\% reduction of the live heap in
                 the production application server. The proposed
                 techniques could also reduce the live heap of standard
                 Java benchmarks by 11.6\% on average, without
                 noticeable performance degradation.",

                 ships with a redesigned version of the client
                 just-in-time compiler that includes several research
                 results of the last years. The client compiler is at
                 the heart of the VM configuration used by default for
                 interactive desktop applications. For such
                 applications, low startup and pause times are more
                 important than peak performance. This paper outlines
                 the new architecture of the client compiler and shows
                 how it interacts with the VM. It presents the
                 intermediate representation that now uses static
                 single-assignment (SSA) form and the linear scan
                 algorithm for global register allocation. Efficient
                 support for exception handling and deoptimization
                 fulfills the demands that are imposed by the dynamic
                 features of the Java programming language. The
                 evaluation shows that the new client compiler generates
                 better code in less time. The popular SPECjvm98
                 benchmark suite is executed 45\% faster, while the
                 compilation speed is also up to 40\% better. This
                 indicates that a carefully selected set of global
                 optimizations can also be integrated in just-in-time
                 compilers that focus on compilation speed and not on
                 peak performance. In addition, the paper presents the
                 impact of several optimizations on execution and
                 compilation speed. As the source code is freely
                 available, the Java HotSpot{\TM} VM and the client
                 compiler are the ideal basis for experiments with new
                 feedback-directed optimizations in a production-level
                 Java just-in-time compiler. The paper outlines research
                 projects that add fast algorithms for escape analysis,
                 automatic object inlining, and array bounds check

  abstract =     "Most Java just-in-time compilers (JITC) try to compile
                 only hot methods since the compilation overhead is part
                 of the running time. This requires precise and
                 efficient hot spot detection, which includes
                 distinguishing hot methods from cold methods, detecting
                 them as early as possible, and paying a small runtime
                 overhead for detection. A hot method could be
                 identified by measuring its running time during
                 interpretation since a long-running method is likely to
                 be a hot method. However, precise measurement of the
                 running time during execution is too expensive,
                 especially in embedded systems, so many counter-based
                 heuristics have been proposed to estimate it. The
                 Simple heuristic counts only method invocations without
                 any consideration of loops [1], while Sun's HotSpot
                 heuristic counts loop iterations as well, but does not
                 consider loop sizes or method sizes [2,14]. The static
                 analysis heuristic estimates the running time of a
                 method by statically analyzing loops or heavy-cost
                 bytecodes but does not measure their dynamic counts
                 [3]. Although the overhead of these heuristics is low,
                 they do not estimate the running time precisely, which
                 may lead to imprecise hot spot detection.\par

                 This paper proposes a new hot spot detection heuristic
                 which can estimate the running time more precisely than
                 others with a relatively low overhead. It dynamically
                 counts only important bytecodes interpreted, but with a
                 simple arithmetic calculation it can obtain the precise
                 count of all interpreted bytecodes. We also propose
                 employing a static analysis technique to predict those
                 hot methods which spend a huge execution time once
                 invoked. This static prediction can allow compiling
                 these methods at their first-invocation, complementing
                 the proposed dynamic estimation technique. We
                 implemented both, which led to a performance benefit of
                 10\% compared to the HotSpot heuristic.",

                 to Java that supports a convenient way of programming
                 with Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The Jedd language
                 abstracts BDDs as database-style relations and
                 operations on relations, and provides static type rules
                 to ensure that relational operations are used
                 correctly.\par

                 The article provides a description of the Jedd language
                 and reports on the design and implementation of the
                 Jedd translator and associated runtime system. Of
                 particular interest is the approach to assigning
                 attributes from the high-level relations to physical
                 domains in the underlying BDDs, which is done by
                 expressing the constraints as a SAT problem and using a
                 modern SAT solver to compute the solution. Further, a
                 runtime system is defined that handles memory
                 management issues and supports a browsable profiling
                 tool for tuning the key BDD operations.\par

                 The motivation for designing Jedd was to support the
                 development of interrelated whole program analyses
                 based on BDDs. We have successfully used Jedd to build
                 Paddle, a framework of context-sensitive program
                 analyses, including points-to analysis and call graph

                 language-level replacement for locks, there is growing
                 need for well-defined semantics. In contrast to
                 database transactions, transaction memory (TM)
                 semantics are complicated by the fact that programs may
                 access the same memory locations both inside and
                 outside transactions. {\em Strongly atomic\/}
                 semantics, where non-transactional accesses are treated
                 as implicit single-operation transactions, remain
                 difficult to provide without specialized hardware
                 support and/or significant performance overhead. As an
                 alternative, many in the community have informally
                 proposed that a {\em single global lock semantics\/}
                 [16, 9], where transaction semantics are mapped to
                 those of regions protected by a single global lock,
                 provide an intuitive and efficiently implementable
                 model for programmers.\par

                 In this paper, we explore the implementation and
                 performance implications of single global lock
                 semantics in a weakly atomic STM from the perspective
                 of Java, and we discuss why even recent STM
                 implementations fall short of these semantics. We
                 describe a new weakly atomic Java STM implementation
                 that provides single global lock semantics while
                 permitting concurrent execution, but we show that this
                 comes at a significant performance cost. We also
                 propose and implement various alternative semantics
                 that loosen single lock requirements while still
                 providing strong guarantees. We compare our new
                 implementations to previous ones, including a strongly
                 atomic STM. [22]",

                 reversible and systematic changes to running Java
                 applications without requiring them to be shut down.
                 PROSE is motivated by scenarios such as hotfixes,
                 online program instrumentation and debugging, and
                 evolution of critical legacy applications. In PROSE,
                 changes to running applications are performed by
                 replacing method bodies. To select which code to
                 replace, PROSE supports matching based on both type
                 information and regular expressions. New code can
                 invoke the method it replaces, facilitating code
                 evolution. Changes are composable, and may be reordered
                 or selectively withdrawn at any time. Furthermore, the

  abstract =     "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in
                 object-oriented programming, allowing new classes to be
                 defined in terms of old classes. When used with care,
                 inheritance is an essential tool for object-oriented
                 programmers. Thus, for those interested in developing
                 formal verification techniques, the treatment of
                 inheritance is of paramount importance. Unfortunately,
                 inheritance comes in a number of guises, all requiring
                 subtle techniques.\par

                 To address these subtleties, most existing verification
                 methodologies typically adopt one of two restrictions
                 to handle inheritance: either (1) they prevent a
                 derived class from restricting the behaviour of its
                 base class (typically by syntactic means) to trivialize
                 the proof obligations; or (2) they allow a derived
                 class to restrict the behaviour of its base class, but
                 require that every inherited method must be reverified.
                 Unfortunately, this means that typical inheritance-rich
                 code either cannot be verified or results in an
                 unreasonable number of proof obligations.\par

                 In this paper, we develop a separation logic for a core
                 object-oriented language. It allows derived classes
                 which override the behaviour of their base class, yet
                 supports the inheritance of methods without
                 reverification where this is safe. For each method, we
                 require two specifications: a static specification that
                 is used to verify the implementation and direct method
                 calls (in Java this would be with a super call); and a
                 dynamic specification that is used for calls that are
                 dynamically dispatched; along with a simple
                 relationship between the two specifications. Only the
                 dynamic specification is involved with behavioural
                 subtyping. This simple separation of concerns leads to
                 a powerful system that supports all forms of
                 inheritance with low proof-obligation overheads. We
                 both formalize our methodology and demonstrate its
                 power with a series of inheritance examples.",

                 dynamic or reflective properties, and ease of
                 implementation. {\em Code-copying\/} is an optimization
                 technique for interpreters that reduces the performance
                 gap between interpretation and {\em JIT\/} compilation,
                 offering significant speedups over direct-threading

                 virtual machine design, however, not all languages
                 benefit from codecopying to the same extent. We
                 consider here properties of interpreted languages, and
                 in particular bytecode and virtual machine construction
                 that enhance or reduce the impact of code-copying. We
                 implemented code-copying and compared performance with
                 the original direct-threading virtual machines for
                 three languages, Java (SableVM), OCaml, and Ruby

                 architectures, ia32 (Pentium 4), x86\_64 (AMD64) and
                 PowerPC (G5). Best speedups are achieved on ia32 by
                 OCaml (maximum 4.88 times, 2.81 times on average),
                 where a small and simple bytecode design facilitates
                 improvements to branch prediction brought by
                 code-copying. Yarv only slightly improves over
                 direct-threading; large working sizes of bytecodes, and
                 a relatively small fraction of time spent in the actual
                 interpreter loop both limit the application of
                 codecopying and its overall net effect. We are able to

                 soundness of a type system automatically using a
                 software model checker. Our idea is to systematically
                 generate every type correct intermediate program state
                 (within some finite bounds), execute the program one
                 step forward if possible using its small step
                 operational semantics, and then check that the
                 resulting intermediate program state is also type
                 correct--but do so efficiently by detecting
                 similarities in this search space and pruning away
                 large portions of the search space. Thus, given only a
                 specification of type correctness and the small step
                 operational semantics for a language, our system
                 automatically checks type soundness by checking that
                 the progress and preservation theorems hold for the
                 language (albeit for program states of at most some
                 finite size). Our preliminary experimental results on
                 several languages--including a language of integer and
                 boolean expressions, a simple imperative programming
                 language, an object-oriented language which is a subset
                 of Java, and a language with ownership types--indicate
                 that our approach is feasible and that our search space
                 pruning techniques do indeed significantly reduce what
                 is otherwise an extremely large search space. Our paper
                 thus makes contributions both in the area of checking
                 soundness of type systems, and in the area of reducing
                 the state space of a software model checker.",

                 However, good names are notoriously hard to choose and
                 manually changing a globally visible name can be a
                 maintenance nightmare. Hence, tool support for
                 automated renaming is an essential aid for developers
                 and widely supported by popular development
                 environments.\par

                 This work improves on two limitations in current
                 refactoring tools: too weak preconditions that lead to
                 unsoundness where names do not bind to the correct
                 declarations after renaming, and too strong
                 preconditions that prevent renaming of certain
                 programs. We identify two main reasons for unsoundness:
                 complex name lookup rules make it hard to define
                 sufficient preconditions, and new language features
                 require additional preconditions. We alleviate both
                 problems by presenting a novel extensible technique for
                 creating symbolic names that are guaranteed to bind to
                 a desired entity in a particular context by inverting
                 lookup functions. The inverted lookup functions can
                 then be tailored to create qualified names where
                 otherwise a conflict would occur, allowing the
                 refactoring to proceed and improve on the problem with
                 too strong preconditions.\par

                 We have implemented renaming for Java as an extension
                 to the JastAdd Extensible Java Compiler and integrated
                 it in Eclipse. We show examples for which other
                 refactoring engines have too weak preconditions, as
                 well as examples where our approach succeeds in
                 renaming entities by inserting qualifications. To
                 validate the extensibility of the approach we have
                 implemented renaming support for Java 5 and AspectJ
                 like inter-type declarations as modular extensions to
                 the initial Java 1.4 refactoring engine. The renaming
                 engine is only a few thousand lines of code including
                 extensions and performance is on par with industrial

  abstract =     "Transactional memory (TM) is a promising concurrency
                 control alternative to locks. Recent work has
                 highlighted important memory model issues regarding TM
                 semantics and exposed problems in existing TM
                 implementations. For safe, managed languages such as
                 Java, there is a growing consensus towards strong
                 atomicity semantics as a sound, scalable solution.
                 Strong atomicity has presented a challenge to implement
                 efficiently because it requires instrumentation of
                 non-transactional memory accesses, incurring
                 significant overhead even when a program makes minimal
                 or no use of transactions. To minimize overhead,
                 existing solutions require either a sophisticated type
                 system, specialized hardware, or static whole-program
                 analysis. These techniques do not translate easily into
                 a production setting on existing hardware. In this
                 paper, we present novel dynamic optimizations that
                 significantly reduce strong atomicity overheads and
                 make strong atomicity practical for dynamic language
                 environments. We introduce analyses that optimistically
                 track which non-transactional memory accesses can avoid
                 strong atomicity instrumentation, and we describe a
                 lightweight speculation and recovery mechanism that
                 applies these analyses to generate
                 speculatively-optimized but safe code for strong
                 atomicity in a dynamically-loaded environment. We show
                 how to implement these mechanisms efficiently by
                 leveraging existing dynamic optimization infrastructure
                 in a Java system. Measurements on a set of
                 transactional and non-transactional Java workloads
                 demonstrate that our techniques substantially reduce
                 the overhead of strong atomicity from a factor of 5x

  abstract =     "Bugs in multi-threaded programs often arise due to
                 data races. Numerous static and dynamic program
                 analysis techniques have been proposed to detect data
                 races. We propose a novel randomized dynamic analysis
                 technique that utilizes potential data race information
                 obtained from an existing analysis tool to separate
                 real races from false races without any need for manual
                 inspection. Specifically, we use potential data race
                 information obtained from an existing dynamic analysis
                 technique to control a random scheduler of threads so
                 that real race conditions get created with very high
                 probability and those races get resolved randomly at
                 runtime. Our approach has several advantages over
                 existing dynamic analysis tools. First, we can create a
                 real race condition and resolve the race randomly to
                 see if an error can occur due to the race. Second, we
                 can replay a race revealing execution efficiently by
                 simply using the same seed for random number
                 generation--we do not need to record the execution.
                 Third, our approach has very low overhead compared to
                 other precise dynamic race detection techniques because
                 we only track all synchronization operations and a
                 single pair of memory access statements that are
                 reported to be in a potential race by an existing
                 analysis. We have implemented the technique in a
                 prototype tool for Java and have experimented on a
                 number of large multi-threaded Java programs. We report
                 a number of previously known and unknown bugs and real
                 races in these Java programs.",

                 exhibit {\em object churn}, the excessive creation of
                 short-lived objects, often caused by trading
                 performance for modularity. Because churned objects are
                 short-lived, they appear to be good candidates for
                 stack allocation. Unfortunately, most churned objects
                 escape their allocating function, making escape
                 analysis ineffective.\par

                 We reduce object churn with three contributions. First,
                 we formalize two measures of churn, {\em capture\/} and
                 {\em control\/} (15). Second, we develop lightweight
                 dynamic analyses for measuring both {\em capture\/} and
                 {\em control}. Third, we develop an algorithm that uses
                 {\em capture\/} and {\em control\/} to inline portions
                 of the call graph to make churned objects non-escaping,
                 enabling churn optimization via escape
                 analysis.\par

                 JOLT is a lightweight dynamic churn optimizer that uses
                 our algorithms. We embedded JOLT in the JIT compiler of
                 the IBM J9 commercial JVM, and evaluated JOLT on large
                 application frameworks, including Eclipse and JBoss. We
                 found that JOLT eliminates over 4 times as many

                 programs in an architecture-neutral format, which can
                 easily be interpreted or compiled. A long-running
                 question in the design of VMs is whether a stack
                 architecture or register architecture can be
                 implemented more efficiently with an interpreter. We
                 extend existing work on comparing virtual stack and
                 virtual register architectures in three ways. First,
                 our translation from stack to register code and
                 optimization are much more sophisticated. The result is
                 that we eliminate an average of more than 46\% of
                 executed VM instructions, with the bytecode size of the
                 register machine being only 26\% larger than that of
                 the corresponding stack one. Second, we present a fully
                 functional virtual-register implementation of the Java
                 virtual machine (JVM), which supports Intel, AMD64,
                 PowerPC and Alpha processors. This register VM supports
                 inline-threaded, direct-threaded, token-threaded, and
                 switch dispatch. Third, we present experimental results
                 on a range of additional optimizations such as register
                 allocation and elimination of redundant heap loads. On
                 the AMD64 architecture the register machine using
                 switch dispatch achieves an average speedup of 1.48
                 over the corresponding stack machine. Even using the
                 more efficient inline-threaded dispatch, the register
                 VM achieves a speedup of 1.15 over the equivalent

  abstract =     "Java 5, the most recent major update to the Java
                 Programming Language, introduced a number of
                 sophisticated features, including a major extension to
                 the type system. While the technical details of these
                 new features are complex, much of this complexity is
                 hidden from the typical Java developer by an ambitious
                 type inference mechanism. Unfortunately, the extensions
                 to the Java 5 type system were so novel that their
                 technical details had not yet been thoroughly
                 investigated in the research literature. As a result,
                 the Java 5 compiler includes a pragmatic but flawed
                 type inference algorithm that is, by design, neither
                 sound nor locally complete. The language specification
                 points out that neither of these failures is
                 catastrophic: the correctness of potentially-unsound
                 results must be verified during type checking; and
                 incompleteness can usually be worked around by manually
                 providing the method type parameter bindings for a
                 given call site.\par

                 This paper dissects the type inference algorithm of
                 Java 5 and proposes a significant revision that is
                 sound and able to calculate correct results where the
                 Java 5 algorithm fails. The new algorithm is locally
                 complete with the exception of a difficult corner case.
                 Moreover, the new algorithm demonstrates that several
                 arbitrary restrictions in the Java type system---most
                 notably the ban on lower-bounded type parameter
                 declarations and the limited expressibility of
                 intersection types---are unnecessary. We hope that this
                 work will spur the evolution of a more coherent, more
                 comprehensive generic type system for Java.",

                 are embedded in the application code, changing between
                 framework vendors may also entail largescale manual
                 changes ({\em Vendor Lock-in\/}).\par

                 This paper presents a novel refactoring approach that
                 effectively solves these two problems. Our approach
                 infers a concise set of semantics-preserving
                 transformation rules from two versions of a single
                 class. Unlike prior approaches that detect only simple
                 structural refactorings, our algorithm can infer
                 general composite refactorings and is more than 97\%
                 accurate on average. We demonstrate the effectiveness
                 of our approach by automatically upgrading more than
                 80K lines of the unit testing code of four open-source
                 Java applications to use the latest version of the
                 popular JUnit testing framework.",

  abstract =     "Large software systems are typically composed of
                 multiple layers, written in different languages and
                 loosely coupled using a string-based interface. For
                 example, in modern web-applications, a server written
                 in Java communicates with a database back-end by
                 passing in query strings. This widely prevalent
                 approach is unsafe as the analyses developed for the
                 individual layers are oblivious to the semantics of the
                 dynamically constructed strings, making it impossible
                 to statically reason about the correctness of the
                 interaction. Further, even simple refactoring in such
                 systems is daunting and error prone as the changes must
                 also be applied to isolated string fragments scattered
                 across the code base.\par

                 We present techniques for deep typechecking and
                 refactoring for systems that combine Java code with a
                 database back-end using the Java Persistence API [10].
                 Deep typechecking ensures that the queries that are
                 constructed dynamically are type safe and that the
                 values returned from the queries are used safely by the
                 program. Deep refactoring builds upon typechecking to
                 allow programmers to safely and automatically propagate
                 code refactorings through the query string
                 fragments.\par

                 Our algorithms are implemented in a tool called QUAIL.
                 We present experiments evaluating the effectiveness of
                 QUAIL on several benchmarks ranging from 3,369 to
                 82,907 lines of code. We show that QUAIL is able to
                 verify that 84\% of query strings in our benchmarks are
                 type safe. Finally, we show that QUAIL reduces the
                 number of places in the code that a programmer must
                 look at in order to perform a refactoring by several
                 orders of magnitude.",

                 polygons into parameterized trapezoids is proposed in

                 technique and can handle polygons with complicated
                 constraints. The input to the algorithm consists of the
                 contour of a parameterized polygon to be partitioned
                 and a set of constraints for parameters of the contour.
                 The algorithm uses horizontal cuts only and generates a
                 number of nonoverlapping trapezoids whose union is the
                 original parameterized polygon. Processing of
                 constraints and coordinates that contain first-order
                 multiple-variable polynomials has been made possible by
                 incorporating the JaCoP constraint programming library.
                 The proposed algorithm has been implemented in Java

  abstract =     "Java programmers can document that the relationship
                 between two objects is unchanging by declaring the
                 field that encodes that relationship to be final. This
                 information can be used in program understanding and
                 detection of errors in new code additions.
                 Unfortunately, few fields in programs are actually
                 declared final. Programs often contain fields that
                 could be final, but are not declared so. Moreover, the
                 definition of final has restrictions on initialization
                 that limit its applicability.\par

                 We introduce stationary fields as a generalization of
                 final. A field in a program is stationary if, for every
                 object that contains it, all writes to the field occur
                 before all the reads. Unlike the definition of final
                 fields, there can be multiple writes during
                 initialization, and initialization can span multiple
                 methods.\par

                 We have developed an efficient algorithm for inferring
                 which fields are stationary in a program, based on the
                 observation that many fields acquire their value very
                 close to object creation. We presume that an object's
                 initialization phase has concluded when its reference
                 is saved in some heap object. We perform precise
                 analysis only regarding recently created objects.
                 Applying our algorithm to real-world Java programs
                 demonstrates that stationary fields are more common
                 than final fields: 44-59\% vs. 11-17\% respectively in
                 our benchmarks.\par

                 These surprising results have several significant
                 implications. First, substantial portions of Java
                 programs appear to be written in a functional style.
                 Second, initialization of these fields occurs very
                 close to object creation, when very good alias
                 information is available. These results open the door
                 for more accurate and efficient pointer alias

                 Our empirical analysis of object demographics reveals
                 that unreachable objects in the heap tend to form

                 processes can manipulate the mapping of the virtual
                 address space through the standard operating system
                 (OS) interface on most platforms, extant
                 parallel/concurrent compactors do not do so to exploit
                 this clustering behavior and instead achieve compaction
                 by performing, relatively expensive, object moving and

                 We introduce the Mapping Collector (MC), which

                 consolidate free space without moving objects and
                 updating pointers. MC is a nearly-single-phase
                 compactor that is simpler and more efficient than
                 previously reported compactors that comprise two to
                 four phases. Through effective MRE-OS coordination, MC
                 maintains the simplicity of a non-moving collector
                 while providing efficient parallel and concurrent
                 compaction.\par

                 We implement both stop-the-world and concurrent MC in a
                 generational garbage collection framework within the

                 experimental evaluation using a multiprocessor
                 indicates that MC significantly increases throughput

                 multiple tiers, such as a web container, application

                 increasingly execute each tier in its own managed

                 manage system complexity through the fault containment
                 and modularity offered by isolated MRE instances. Such
                 isolation, however, necessitates expensive cross-tier
                 communication based on protocols such as object
                 serialization and remote procedure calls.
                 Administrators commonly co-locate communicating MREs on
                 a single host to reduce communication overhead and to
                 better exploit increasing numbers of available
                 processing cores. However, state-of-the-art MREs offer
                 no support for more efficient communication between
                 co-located MREs, while fast inter-process communication
                 mechanisms, such as shared memory, are widely available

                 To address this growing need, we present the design and
                 implementation of XMem ? type-safe, transparent, shared
                 memory support for co-located MREs. XMem guarantees
                 type-safety through coordinated, parallel,
                 multi-process class loading and garbage collection. To
                 avoid introducing any level of indirection, XMem
                 manipulates virtual memory mapping. In addition, object
                 sharing in XMem is fully transparent: shared objects
                 are identical to local objects in terms of field
                 access, synchronization, garbage collection, and method
                 invocation, with the only difference being that
                 shared-to-private pointers are disallowed. XMem
                 facilitates easy integration and use by existing
                 communication technologies and software systems, such
                 as RMI, JNDI, JDBC, serialization/XML, and network

                 technologies underlying J2EE, as well as using
                 open-source server applications, indicates that XMem
                 significantly improves throughput and response time by

                 behavior in the face of exceptional situations is
                 important to the reliability of long-running programs.
                 Existing programming language features often provide
                 poor support for executing clean-up code and for
                 restoring invariants.\par

                 We present a data-flow analysis for finding a certain
                 class of exception-handling defects: those related to a
                 failure to release resources or to clean up properly
                 along all paths. Many real-world programs violate such
                 resource usage rules because of incorrect exception
                 handling. Our flow-sensitive analysis keeps track of
                 outstanding obligations along program paths and does a
                 precise modeling of control flow in the presence of
                 exceptions. Using it, we have found over 1,300
                 exception handling defects in over 5 million lines of
                 Java code.\par

                 Based on those defects we propose a programming
                 language feature, the compensation stack, that keeps
                 track of obligations at run time and ensures that they
                 are discharged. We present a type system for
                 compensation stacks that tracks collections of
                 obligations. Finally, we present case studies to
                 demonstrate that this feature is natural, efficient,

                 used as a mechanism for synchronization. Because
                 today's operating systems do not consider lock usage as
                 a scheduling criterion, scheduling decisions can be
                 unfavorable to multithreaded applications, leading to
                 performance issues such as convoying and heavy lock
                 contention in systems with multiple processors.
                 Previous efforts to address these issues (e.g.,
                 transactional memory, lock-free data structure) often
                 treat scheduling decisions as 'a fact of life,' and

  abstract =     "We present the first verification of full functional
                 correctness for a range of linked data structure
                 implementations, including mutable lists, trees,
                 graphs, and hash tables. Specifically, we present the
                 use of the Jahob verification system to verify formal
                 specifications, written in classical higher-order
                 logic, that completely capture the desired behavior of
                 the Java data structure implementations (with the
                 exception of properties involving execution time and/or
                 memory consumption). Given that the desired correctness
                 properties include intractable constructs such as
                 quantifiers, transitive closure, and lambda
                 abstraction, it is a challenge to successfully prove
                 the generated verification conditions.\par

                 Our Jahob verification system uses integrated reasoning
                 to split each verification condition into a conjunction
                 of simpler subformulas, then apply a diverse collection
                 of specialized decision procedures, first-order theorem
                 provers, and, in the worst case, interactive theorem
                 provers to prove each subformula. Techniques such as
                 replacing complex subformulas with stronger but simpler
                 alternatives, exploiting structure inherently present
                 in the verification conditions, and, when necessary,
                 inserting verified lemmas and proof hints into the
                 imperative source code make it possible to seamlessly
                 integrate all of the specialized decision procedures
                 and theorem provers into a single powerful integrated
                 reasoning system. By appropriately applying multiple
                 proof techniques to discharge different subformulas,
                 this reasoning system can effectively prove the complex
                 and challenging verification conditions that arise in
                 this context.",

  abstract =     "Mitchell's notion of representation independence is a
                 particularly useful application of Reynolds' relational
                 parametricity -- two different implementations of an
                 abstract data type can be shown contextually equivalent
                 so long as there exists a relation between their type
                 representations that is preserved by their operations.
                 There have been a number of methods proposed for
                 proving representation independence in various pure
                 extensions of System F (where data abstraction is
                 achieved through existential typing), as well as in
                 Algol- or Java-like languages (where data abstraction
                 is achieved through the use of local mutable state).
                 However, none of these approaches addresses the
                 interaction of existential type abstraction and local
                 state. In particular, none allows one to prove
                 representation independence results for generative ADTs
                 -- i.e. ADTs that both maintain some local state and
                 define abstract types whose internal representations
                 are dependent on that local state.\par

                 In this paper, we present a syntactic,
                 logical-relations-based method for proving
                 representation independence of generative ADTs in a
                 language supporting polymorphic types, existential
                 types, general recursive types, and unrestricted
                 ML-style mutable references. We demonstrate the
                 effectiveness of our method by using it to prove
                 several interesting contextual equivalences that
                 involve a close interaction between existential typing
                 and local state, as well as some well-known
                 equivalences from the literature (such as Pitts and
                 Stark's 'awkward' example) that have caused trouble for
                 previous logical-relations-based methods.\par

                 The success of our method relies on two key technical
                 innovations. First, in order to handle generative ADTs,
                 we develop a possible-worlds model in which relational
                 interpretations of types are allowed to grow over time
                 in a manner that is tightly coupled with changes to
                 some local state. Second, we employ a step-indexed
                 stratification of possible worlds, which facilitates a
                 simplified account of mutable references of higher
                 type.",

                 construct that achieve three important goals. They
                 achieve low latency while allowing the fullest use of
                 Java language features, compared to previous attempts
                 to restrict the Java language for use in the
                 submillisecond domain. They support pluggable
                 schedulers, allowing easy implementation of new
                 scheduling paradigms in a real-time Java system. They
                 can achieve deterministic timing, even in the presence
                 of other Java threads, and across changes of hardware
                 and software platform. To achieve these goals, the
                 program is divided into tasks with private heaps. Tasks
                 may be strongly isolated, communicating only with each
                 other and guaranteeing determinism, or weakly isolated,
                 allowing some communication with the rest of the Java
                 application. Scheduling of the tasks' execution,
                 garbage collection, and value passing is accomplished
                 by the pluggable scheduler. Schedulers that we have
                 written employ logical execution time (LET) in
                 association with strong isolation to achieve time
                 portability. We have also built a quad-rotor model

                 Unfortunately, the runtime policies we require program

                 significantly improve a system's performance. In a
                 Java-based system, we then have to consider a hybrid
                 architecture that consists of a Java Virtual Machine
                 running on a general-purpose processor connected to the
                 hardware accelerator. In such a hybrid architecture,
                 data communication between the accelerator and the
                 general-purpose processor can incur a significant cost,
                 which may even annihilate the original performance
                 improvement of adding the accelerator. A careful layout
                 of the data in the memory structure is therefore of
                 major importance to maintain the acceleration
                 performance benefits.\par

                 This article addresses the reduction of the
                 communication cost in a distributed shared memory
                 consisting of the main memory of the processor and the
                 accelerator's local memory, which are unified in the
                 Java heap. Since memory access times are highly
                 nonuniform, a suitable allocation of objects in either
                 main memory or the accelerator's local memory can
                 significantly reduce the communication cost. We propose
                 several techniques for finding the optimal location for
                 each Java object's data, either statically through
                 profiling or dynamically at runtime. We show how we can
                 reduce communication cost by up to 86\% for the SPECjvm
                 and DaCapo benchmarks. We also show that the best

                 incomplete programs. The price of these features comes
                 later in the software life cycle. Scripts are hard to

                 memory errors such as dangling pointers, double frees,
                 and buffer overflows. However, because garbage
                 collection uses reachability to over-approximate live
                 objects, programs may still leak memory if programmers
                 forget to eliminate the last reference to an object
                 that will not be used again. Leaks slow programs by
                 increasing collector workload and frequency. Growing
                 leaks eventually crash programs.\par

                 This paper introduces leak pruning, which keeps
                 programs running by predicting and reclaiming leaked
                 objects at run time. It predicts dead objects and
                 reclaims them based on observing data structure usage
                 patterns. Leak pruning preserves semantics because it
                 waits for heap exhaustion before reclaiming objects and
                 poisons references to objects it reclaims. If the
                 program later tries to access a poisoned reference, the
                 virtual machine (VM) throws an error. We show leak
                 pruning has low overhead in a Java VM and evaluate it
                 on 10 leaking programs. Leak pruning does not help two
                 programs, executes five substantial programs 1.6-81X
                 longer, and executes three programs, including a leak
                 in Eclipse, for at least 24 hours. In the worst case,
                 leak pruning defers fatal errors. In the best case, it
                 keeps leaky programs running with preserved semantics
                 and consistent throughput.",

                 of Java programs. DOOP builds on the idea of specifying

                 Datalog: a logic-based language for defining
                 (recursive) relations. We carry the declarative
                 approach further than past work by describing the full
                 end-to-end analysis in Datalog and optimizing
                 aggressively using a novel technique specifically
                 targeting highly recursive Datalog programs.\par

                 As a result, DOOP achieves several benefits, including
                 full order-of-magnitude improvements in runtime. We
                 compare DOOP with Lhotak and Hendren's PADDLE, which
                 defines the state of the art for context-sensitive
                 analyses. For the exact same logical points-to
                 definitions (and, consequently, identical precision)
                 DOOP is more than 15x faster than PADDLE for a

  abstract =     "Researchers in transactional memory (TM) have proposed
                 open nesting as a methodology for increasing the
                 concurrency of transactional programs. The idea is to
                 ignore ``low-level'' memory operations of an
                 open-nested transaction when detecting conflicts for
                 its parent transaction, and instead perform abstract
                 concurrency control for the ``high-level'' operation
                 that the nested transaction represents. To support this
                 methodology, TM systems use an open-nested commit
                 mechanism that commits all changes performed by an
                 open-nested transaction directly to memory, thereby
                 avoiding low-level conflicts. Unfortunately, because
                 the TM runtime is unaware of the different levels of
                 memory, unconstrained use of open-nested commits can
                 lead to anomalous program behavior.\par

                 We describe the framework of {\em ownership-aware
                 transactional memory\/} which incorporates the notion
                 of modules into the TM system and requires that
                 transactions and data be associated with specific {\em
                 transactional modules\/} or Xmodules. We propose a new
                 {\em ownership-aware commit mechanism\/}, a hybrid
                 between an open-nested and closed-nested commit which
                 commits a piece of data differently depending on which
                 Xmodule owns the data. Moreover, we provide a set of
                 precise constraints on interactions and sharing of data
                 among the Xmodules based on familiar notions of
                 abstraction. The ownership-aware commit mechanism and
                 these restrictions on Xmodules allow us to prove that
                 ownership-aware TM has clean memory-level semantics. In
                 particular, it guarantees {\em serializability by
                 modules\/}, an adaptation of the definition of
                 multilevel serializability from database systems. In
                 addition, we describe how a programmer can specify
                 Xmodules and ownership in a Java-like language. Our
                 type system can enforce most of the constraints
                 required by ownership-aware TM statically, and can
                 enforce the remaining constraints dynamically. Finally,
                 we prove that if transactions in the process of
                 aborting obey restrictions on their memory footprint,
                 then ownership-aware TM is free from {\em semantic
                 deadlock\/}.",

                 bug-finding, specification inference, verification, and
                 test generation. This paper addresses demand-driven
                 symbolic analysis for object-oriented programs and
                 frameworks. Many such codes comprise large, partial
                 programs with highly dynamic behaviors--polymorphism,
                 reflection, and so on--posing significant scalability
                 challenges for any static analysis.\par

                 We present an approach based on interprocedural
                 backwards propagation of weakest preconditions. We
                 present several novel techniques to improve the
                 efficiency of such analysis. First, we present {\em
                 directed call graph construction}, where call graph
                 construction and symbolic analysis are interleaved.
                 With this technique, call graph construction is guided
                 by constraints discovered during symbolic analysis,
                 obviating the need for exhaustively exploring a large,
                 conservative call graph. Second, we describe {\em
                 generalization}, a technique that greatly increases the
                 reusability of procedure summaries computed during
                 interprocedural analysis. Instead of tabulating how a
                 procedure transforms a symbolic state in its entirety,
                 our technique tabulates how the procedure transforms
                 only the pertinent portion of the symbolic state.
                 Additionally, we show how integrating an inexpensive,
                 custom logic simplifier with weakest precondition
                 computation dramatically improves performance.\par

                 We have implemented the analysis in a tool called
                 Snugglebug and evaluated it as a bug-report feasibility
                 checker. Our results show that the algorithmic
                 techniques were critical for successfully analyzing
                 large Java applications.",

                 Modern Web applications typically implement some
                 functionality as client-side JavaScript code, for
                 improved interactivity. Moving code and data to the

                 Swift automatically partitions application code while
                 providing assurance that the resulting placement is
                 secure and efficient. Application code is written as
                 Java-like code annotated with information flow policies

                 dynamic scripting language that executes in client
                 browsers. A common paradigm in such websites is to
                 include third-party JavaScript code in the form of
                 libraries or advertisements. If this code were
                 malicious, it could read sensitive information from the
                 page or write to the location bar, thus redirecting the
                 user to a malicious page, from which the entire machine
                 could be compromised. We present an information-flow
                 based approach for inferring the effects that a piece
                 of JavaScript has on the website in order to ensure
                 that key security properties are not violated. To
                 handle dynamically loaded and generated JavaScript, we
                 propose a framework for staging information flow

                 through the currently known code in order to compute a

                 evaluate our system's performance on a variety of large

                 information flow is feasible and efficient for
                 JavaScript, and that our technique allows the

                 Many implementation techniques have been proposed and
                 several compilation schemes can be considered from
                 fully global compilation under the closed-world

                 the Prm compiler that has been designed for this

                 detectors that never report false alarms. The latter

                 requires only constant space and supports constant-time

                 difficult to compile than statically typed ones. Since
                 no concrete type information is available, traditional
                 compilers need to emit generic code that can handle all
                 possible type combinations at runtime. We present an
                 alternative compilation technique for dynamically-typed
                 languages that identifies frequently executed loop
                 traces at run-time and then generates machine code on
                 the fly that is specialized for the actual dynamic
                 types occurring on each path through the loop. Our
                 method provides cheap inter-procedural type
                 specialization, and an elegant and efficient way of
                 incrementally compiling lazily discovered alternative
                 paths through nested loops. We have implemented a
                 dynamic compiler for JavaScript based on our technique

                 emergence of applications that are composed from a
                 variety of services and data sources. Through tools
                 such as Yahoo Pipes, these ``mash-ups'' can be composed
                 in a dynamic, just-in-time manner from components
                 provided by multiple institutions (i.e., Google,
                 Amazon, your neighbor). However, when using these
                 applications, it is not apparent where data comes from
                 or how it is processed. Thus, to inspire trust and
                 confidence in mash-ups, it is critical to be able to
                 analyze their processes after the fact. These {\em

                 and complex, so do programs. High-level abstractions
                 introduced to deal with complexity in large programs,
                 while simplifying human reasoning, can often obfuscate
                 salient program properties gleaned from automated
                 source-level analysis through subtle (often non-local)
                 interactions. Consequently, understanding the effects
                 of program changes and whether these changes violate
                 intended protocols become difficult to infer.
                 Refactorings, and feature additions, modifications, or
                 removals can introduce hard-to-catch bugs that often go
                 undetected until many revisions later.\par

                 To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
                 dynamic program analysis that builds a {\em semantic
                 view\/} of program executions. These views reflect
                 program abstractions and aspects; however, views are
                 not simply projections of execution traces, but are
                 linked to each other to capture semantic interactions
                 among abstractions at different levels of granularity
                 in a scalable manner.\par

                 We describe our approach in the context of Java and
                 demonstrate its utility to improve {\em regression
                 analysis}. We first formalize a subset of Java and a
                 grammar for traces generated at program execution. We
                 then introduce several types of views used to analyze
                 regression bugs along with a novel, scalable technique
                 for semantic differencing of traces from different
                 versions of the same program. Benchmark results on
                 large open-source Java programs demonstrate that
                 semantic-aware trace differencing can identify precise
                 and useful details about the underlying cause for a
                 regression, even in programs that use reflection,

                 exploits a processor's HPM (Hardware Performance
                 Monitor) to collect information on running Java
                 applications for use by the Java VM. Our profiler
                 provides two novel features: Java-level event profiling
                 and lightweight context-sensitive event profiling. For
                 Java events, we propose new techniques to leverage the
                 sampling facility of the HPM to generate object
                 creation profiles and lock activity profiles. The HPM
                 sampling is the key to achieve a smaller overhead
                 compared to profilers that do not rely on hardware
                 helps. To sample the object creations with the HPM,
                 which can only sample hardware events such as executed
                 instructions or cache misses, we correlate the object
                 creations with the store instructions for Java object
                 headers. For the lock activity profile, we introduce an
                 instrumentation-based technique, called ProbeNOP, which
                 uses a special NOP instruction whose executions are
                 counted by the HPM. For the context-sensitive event
                 profiling, we propose a new technique called {\em
                 CallerChaining}, which detects the calling context of
                 HPM events based on the call stack depth (the value of
                 the stack frame pointer). We show that it can detect
                 the calling contexts in many programs including a large
                 commercial application. Our proposed techniques enable
                 both programmers and runtime systems to get more
                 valuable information from the HPM to understand and
                 optimize the programs without adding significant
                 runtime overhead.",

                 kinds of applications because they provide clear
                 software engineering and security advantages.
                 Unfortunately, garbage collection imposes a toll on
                 performance and introduces pause times, making such
                 languages less attractive for high-performance or
                 real-time applications. Much progress has been made
                 over the last five decades to reduce the overhead of
                 garbage collection, but it remains significant.\par

                 We propose a cooperative hardware-software technique to
                 reduce the performance overhead of garbage collection.
                 The key idea is to reduce the frequency of garbage
                 collection by efficiently detecting and reusing dead
                 memory space in hardware via hardware-implemented
                 reference counting. Thus, even though software garbage
                 collections are still eventually needed, they become
                 much less frequent and have less impact on overall
                 performance. Our technique is compatible with a variety
                 of software garbage collection algorithms, does not
                 break compatibility with existing software, and reduces
                 garbage collection time by 31\% on average on the Java
                 DaCapo benchmarks running on the production build of
                 the Jikes RVM, which uses a state-of-the-art

                 programmer productivity, providing rapid, interactive
                 feedback based on the syntax and semantics of a
                 language. A heavy burden lies on developers of new
                 languages to provide adequate IDE support. Code
                 generation techniques provide a viable, efficient
                 approach to semi-automatically produce IDE plugins. Key
                 components for the realization of plugins are the
                 language's grammar and parser. For embedded languages
                 and language extensions, constituent IDE plugin modules
                 and their grammars can be combined. Unlike conventional
                 parsing algorithms, scannerless generalized-LR parsing
                 supports the full set of context-free grammars, which
                 is closed under composition, and hence can parse
                 language embeddings and extensions composed from
                 separate grammar modules. To apply this algorithm in an
                 interactive environment, this paper introduces a novel
                 error recovery mechanism, which allows it to be used
                 with files with syntax errors -- common in interactive
                 editing. Error recovery is vital for providing rapid
                 feedback in case of syntax errors, as most IDE services
                 depend on the parser from syntax highlighting to
                 semantic analysis and cross-referencing. We base our
                 approach on the principles of island grammars, and
                 derive permissive grammars with error recovery
                 productions from normal SDF grammars. To cope with the
                 added complexity of these grammars, we adapt the parser
                 to support backtracking. We evaluate the recovery
                 quality and performance of our approach using a set of
                 composed languages, based on Java and Stratego.",

                 of optimizations to be selected over another based on
                 run time performance. Self-tuned libraries, iterative
                 compilation and machine learning techniques all compare
                 multiple compiled program versions. In each, program
                 versions are timed to determine which has the best
                 performance.\par

                 The program needs to be run multiple times for each
                 version because there is noise inherent in most
                 performance measurements. The number of runs must be
                 enough to compare different versions, despite the
                 noise, but executing more than this will waste time and
                 energy. The compiler writer must either risk taking too
                 few runs, potentially getting incorrect results, or
                 taking too many runs increasing the time for their
                 experiments or reducing the number of program versions
                 evaluated. Prior works choose constant size sampling
                 plans where each compiled version is executed a fixed

                 In this paper we develop a sequential sampling plan

                 the compiler writer can have both confidence in the

                 than were needed. We show that our system is able to
                 correctly determine the best optimization settings with
                 between 76\% and 87\% fewer runs than needed by a brute
                 force, constant sampling size approach. We also compare
                 our approach to JavaSTATS(10); we needed 77\% to 89\%

                 languages to reuse legacy code and leverage languages
                 best suited to their problems. For instance, the same
                 program may use Java for ease-of-programming and C to
                 interface with the operating system. These programs
                 pose significant debugging challenges, because
                 programmers need to understand and control code across
                 languages, which may execute in different environments.
                 Unfortunately, traditional multilingual debuggers
                 require a {\em single\/} execution
                 environment.\par

                 This paper presents a novel {\em composition\/}
                 approach to building portable mixed-environment
                 debuggers, in which an intermediate agent interposes on
                 language transitions, controlling and reusing
                 single-environment debuggers. We implement debugger
                 composition in {\em Blink}, a debugger for Java, C, and
                 the Jeannie programming language. We show that Blink is
                 (1) relatively simple: it requires modest amounts of
                 new code; (2) portable: it supports multiple Java
                 Virtual Machines, C compilers, operating systems, and
                 component debuggers; and (3) powerful: composition
                 eases debugging, while supporting new mixed-language
                 expression evaluation and Java Native Interface (JNI)
                 bug diagnostics. In real-world case studies, we show
                 that language-interface errors require
                 single-environment debuggers to restart execution
                 multiple times, whereas Blink directly diagnoses them
                 with one execution. We also describe extensions for

                 programming model suitable for irregular,
                 heap-manipulating applications like mesh refinement and
                 epidemic simulations, and {\em JChorus}, an
                 implementation of the model on top of Java. One goal of
                 Chorus is to express the {\em dynamic\/} and
                 instance-dependent patterns of memory access that are
                 common in typical irregular applications. Its other
                 focus is {\em locality of effects\/}: the property that
                 in many of the same applications, typical imperative
                 commands only affect small, local regions in the shared
                 heap.\par

                 Chorus addresses dynamism and locality through the
                 unifying abstraction of an {\em object assembly\/}: a
                 local region in a shared data structure equipped with a
                 short-lived, speculative thread of control. The thread
                 of control in an assembly can only access objects
                 within the assembly. While objects can migrate from
                 assembly to assembly, such migration is {\em local\/}
                 --i.e., objects only move from one assembly to a
                 neighboring one--and does not lead to aliasing.
                 Programming primitives include a {\em merge\/}
                 operation, by which an assembly merges with an adjacent
                 assembly, and a {\em split\/} operation, which splits
                 an assembly into smaller ones. Our abstractions are
                 race and deadlock-free, and inherently
                 data-centric.\par

                 We demonstrate that Chorus and JChorus allow natural
                 programming of several important applications
                 exhibiting irregular data-parallelism. We also present
                 an implementation of JChorus based on a many-to-one

                 Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) paradigm. A
                 SystemJ program is a collection of GALS nodes, also
                 called clock domains, and each clock domain is a
                 synchronous program that extends the Java language.
                 Initial compilation of SystemJ has been to standard
                 Java executing on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which
                 is both inefficient and bulky for small embedded
                 systems. This article proposes a new approach for
                 compiling and executing SystemJ using a new type of
                 virtual machine, called a Tandem Virtual Machine (TVM).
                 The TVM approach provides an efficient implementation
                 of SystemJ on both standard processors and
                 resource-constrained embedded processors. The new
                 approach is based on separating the control-driven and
                 data-driven operations for execution on two virtual
                 machines. While the JVM executes the data-driven
                 operations, a Control Virtual Machine (CVM) is
                 introduced to execute the control-driven parts of a
                 SystemJ program. The TVM approach is capable of
                 handling all data-driven and control-driven operations
                 required by the GALS model. The benchmark results show
                 that the TVM has code size improvements of over 60\% on
                 average and also a substantial improvement in execution

  abstract =     "Interoperability is big business, a fact to which
                 .NET, the JVM, and COM can attest. Language designers
                 are well aware of this, and they are designing
                 programming languages that reflect it --- for instance,
                 SML.NET, F\#, Mondrian, and Scala all treat
                 interoperability as a central design feature. Still,
                 current multi-language research tends not to focus on
                 the semantics of these features, but only on how to
                 implement them efficiently. In this article, we attempt
                 to rectify that by giving a technique for specifying
                 the operational semantics of a multi-language system as
                 a composition of the models of its constituent
                 languages. Our technique abstracts away the low-level
                 details of interoperability like garbage collection and
                 representation coherence, and lets us focus on semantic
                 properties like type-safety, equivalence, and
                 termination behavior. In doing so it allows us to adapt
                 standard theoretical techniques such as
                 subject-reduction, logical relations, and operational
                 equivalence for use on multi-language systems.
                 Generally speaking, our proofs of properties in a
                 multi-language context are mutually referential
                 versions of their single language counterparts.\par

                 We demonstrate our technique with a series of
                 strategies for embedding a Scheme-like language into an
                 ML-like language. We start by connecting very simple
                 languages with a very simple strategy, and work our way
                 up to languages that interact in sophisticated ways and
                 have sophisticated features such as polymorphism and
                 effects. Along the way, we prove relevant results such
                 as type-soundness and termination for each system we
                 present using adaptations of standard
                 techniques.\par

                 Beyond giving simple expressive models, our studies
                 have uncovered several interesting facts about
                 interoperability. For example, higher-order function
                 contracts naturally emerge as the glue to ensure that
                 interoperating languages respect each other's type
                 systems. Our models also predict that the embedding
                 strategy where foreign values are opaque is as
                 expressive as the embedding strategy where foreign
                 values are translated to corresponding values in the
                 other language, and we were able to experimentally
                 verify this behavior using PLT Scheme's foreign
                 function interface.",

                 The web is in constant flux---new pages and Web sites
                 appear daily, and old pages and sites disappear almost
                 as quickly. One study estimates that about two percent
                 of the Web disappears from its current location every
                 week.$^2$ Although Web users have become accustomed to
                 seeing the infamous '404 Not Found' page, they are more
                 taken aback when they own, are responsible for, or have
                 come to rely on the missing material.\par

                 Web archivists like those at the Internet Archive have
                 responded to the Web's transience by archiving as much
                 of it as possible, hoping to preserve snapshots of the
                 Web for future generations.$^3$ Search engines have
                 also responded by offering pages that have been cached
                 as a result of the indexing process. These
                 straightforward archiving and caching efforts have been
                 used by the public in unintended ways: individuals and
                 organizations have used them to restore their own lost
                 Web sites.$^5$\par

                 To automate recovering lost Web sites, we created a
                 Web-repository crawler named Warrick that restores lost
                 resources from the holdings of four Web repositories:
                 Internet Archive, Google, Live Search (now Bing), and
                 Yahoo;$^6$ we refer to these Web repositories
                 collectively as the {\em Web Infrastructure\/} (WI). We
                 call this after-loss recovery {\em Lazy Preservation\/}
                 (see the sidebar for more information). Warrick can
                 only recover what is accessible to the WI, namely the
                 crawlable Web. There are numerous resources that cannot
                 be found in the WI: password protected content, pages
                 without incoming links or protected by the robots
                 exclusion protocol, and content hidden behind Flash or
                 JavaScript interfaces. Most importantly, WI crawlers do
                 not have access to the server-side components (for
                 example, scripts, configuration files, databases, among
                 others) of a Web site.\par

                 Nevertheless, upon Warrick's public release in 2005, we
                 received many inquiries about its usage and collected a
                 handful of anecdotes about the Web sites individuals
                 and organizations had lost and wanted to recover. Were
                 these Web sites representative? What types of Web
                 resources were people losing? Given the inherent
                 limitations of the WI, were Warrick users recovering
                 enough material to reconstruct the site? Were these
                 losses changing their behavior, or was the availability
                 of cached material reinforcing a 'lazy' approach to
                 preservation?\par

                 We constructed an online survey to explore these
                 questions and conducted a set of in-depth interviews
                 with survey respondents to clarify the results.
                 Potential participants were solicited by us or the
                 Internet Archive, or they found a link to the survey
                 from the Warrick Web site. A total of 52 participants
                 completed the survey regarding 55 lost Web sites, and
                 seven of the participants allowed us to follow-up with
                 telephone or instant messaging interviews. Participants
                 were divided into two groups:\par

                 1. {\em Personal loss:\/} Those who had lost (and tried
                 to recover) a Web site that they had personally
                 created, maintained or owned (34 participants who lost
                 37 Web sites).\par

                 2. {\em Third party:\/} Those who had recovered someone
                 else's lost Web site (18 participants who recovered 18

                 communicate with servers and have rich, interactive
                 interfaces. Flapjax provides two key features that
                 simplify writing these applications. First, it provides
                 {\em event streams}, a uniform abstraction for
                 communication within a program as well as with external
                 Web services. Second, the language itself is reactive:
                 it automatically tracks data dependencies and
                 propagates updates along those dataflows. This allows
                 developers to write reactive interfaces in a
                 declarative and compositional style.\par

                 Flapjax is built on top of JavaScript. It runs on
                 unmodified browsers and readily interoperates with
                 existing JavaScript code. It is usable as either a
                 programming language (that is compiled to JavaScript)
                 or as a JavaScript library, and is designed for both
                 uses. This paper presents the language, its design

                 language mechanism for determining the method
                 implementation to be invoked upon a message send. With
                 predicate dispatch, each method implementation includes
                 a predicate guard specifying the conditions under which
                 the method should be invoked, and logical implication
                 of predicates determines the method overriding
                 relation. Predicate dispatch naturally unifies and
                 generalizes several common forms of dynamic dispatch,
                 including traditional OO dispatch, multimethod
                 dispatch, and functional-style pattern matching.
                 Unfortunately, prior languages supporting predicate
                 dispatch have had several deficiencies that limit the
                 practical utility of this language feature.\par

                 We describe JPred, a backward-compatible extension to
                 Java supporting predicate dispatch. While prior
                 languages with predicate dispatch have been extensions
                 to toy or nonmainstream languages, we show how
                 predicate dispatch can be naturally added to a
                 traditional OO language. While prior languages with
                 predicate dispatch have required the whole program to
                 be available for typechecking and compilation, JPred
                 retains Java's modular typechecking and compilation
                 strategies. While prior languages with predicate
                 dispatch have included special-purpose algorithms for
                 reasoning about predicates, JPred employs
                 general-purpose, off-the-shelf decision procedures. As
                 a result, JPred's type system is more flexible,
                 allowing several useful programming idioms that are
                 spuriously rejected by those other languages. After
                 describing the JPred language informally, we present an
                 extension to Featherweight Java that formalizes the
                 language and its modular type system, which we have
                 proven sound. Finally, we discuss two case studies that
                 illustrate the practical utility of JPred, including
                 its use in the detection of several errors.",

                 whose goal is to evade geolocation. We do so by
                 examining first the limitations of existing techniques,

                 geolocation by relaying traffic through a proxy server

                 as many end-users might expect. We give a demonstration

                 for optimizers and programmer-productivity tools.
                 Unfortunately, previous approaches for collecting path
                 profiles are expensive: they need to either execute
                 additional instructions (to track calls and returns) or
                 they need to walk the stack. The state-of-the-art
                 techniques for call path profiling slow down the
                 program by 7\% (for C programs) and 20\% (for Java
                 programs). This paper describes an innovative technique
                 that collects minimal information from the running
                 program and later (offline) infers the full call paths
                 from this information.\par

                 The key insight behind our approach is that readily
                 available information during program execution - the
                 height of the call stack and the identity of the
                 current executing function - are good indicators of
                 calling context. We call this pair a {\em context
                 identifier}. Because more than one call path may have
                 the same context identifier, we show how to
                 disambiguate context identifiers by changing the sizes
                 of function activation records. This disambiguation has
                 no overhead in terms of executed instructions.\par

                 We evaluate our approach on the SPEC CPU 2006 C++ and C
                 benchmarks. We show that collecting context identifiers
                 slows down programs by 0.17\% (geometric mean). We can
                 map these context identifiers to the correct unique
                 call path 80\% of the time for C++ programs and 95\% of

                 preferred NUMA nodes for objects with negligible
                 overhead during the garbage collection time as well as
                 object allocation time. Since the number of CPUs (or
                 NUMA nodes) is increasing recently, it is critical for
                 the memory manager of the runtime environment of an
                 object-oriented language to exploit the low latency of
                 local memory for high performance. To locate the CPU of
                 a thread that frequently accesses an object, prior
                 research uses the runtime information about memory
                 accesses as sampled by the hardware. However, the
                 overhead of this approach is high for a garbage
                 collector.\par

                 Our approach uses the information about which thread
                 can exclusively access an object, or the {\em Dominant
                 Thread\/} (DoT). The dominant thread of an object is
                 the thread that often most accesses an object so that
                 we do not require memory access samples. Our NUMA-aware
                 GC performs DoT based object copying, which copies each
                 live object to the CPU where the dominant thread was
                 last dispatched before GC. The dominant thread
                 information is known from the thread stack and from
                 objects that are locked or reserved by threads and is
                 propagated in the object reference graph.\par

                 We demonstrate that our approach can improve the
                 performance of benchmark programs such as SPECpower
                 ssj2008, SPECjbb2005, and SPECjvm2008. We prototyped a
                 NUMA-aware memory manager on a modified version of IBM
                 Java VM and tested it on a cc-NUMA POWER6 machine with
                 eight NUMA nodes. Our NUMA-aware GC achieved
                 performance improvements up to 14.3\% and 2.0\% on
                 average over a JVM that only used the NUMA-aware
                 allocator. The total improvement using both the
                 NUMA-aware allocator and GC is up to 53.1\% and 10.8\%

                 for C language programs that is fully compatible with
                 the ANSI C specification.\par

                 Programs written in C often suffer from nasty errors
                 due to dangling pointers and buffer overflow. Such
                 errors in Internet server programs are often exploited
                 by malicious attackers to crack an entire system. The
                 origin of these errors is usually corruption of
                 in-memory data structures caused by out-of-bound array
                 accesses. Usual C compilers do not provide any
                 protection against such out-of-bound access, although
                 many other languages such as Java and ML do provide
                 such protection. There have been several proposals for
                 preventing such memory corruption from various aspects:
                 runtime buffer overrun detectors, designs for new
                 C-like languages, and compilers for (subsets of) the C
                 language. However, as far as we know, none of them have
                 achieved full memory protection and full compatibility
                 with the C language specification at the same
                 time.\par

                 We propose the most powerful solution to this problem
                 ever presented. We have developed {\em Fail-Safe C}, a
                 memory-safe implementation of the full ANSI C language.
                 It detects and disallows all unsafe operations, yet
                 conforms to the full ANSI C standard (including casts
                 and unions). This paper introduces several
                 techniques--both compile-time and runtime--to reduce
                 the overhead of runtime checks, while still maintaining
                 100\% memory safety. This compiler lets programmers
                 easily make their programs safe without heavy rewriting
                 or porting of their code. It also supports many of the
                 'dirty tricks' commonly used in many existing C
                 programs, which do not strictly conform to the standard
                 specification. In this paper, we demonstrate several
                 real-world server programs that can be processed by our
                 compiler and present technical details and benchmark
                 results for it.",

                 Haskell. Session types statically enforce that
                 client-server communication proceeds according to
                 protocols. They have been added to several concurrent
                 calculi, but few implementations of session types are
                 available.\par

                 Our embedding takes advantage of Haskell where
                 appropriate, but we rely on no exotic features. Thus
                 our approach translates with minimal modification to
                 other polymorphic, typed languages such as ML and Java.
                 Our implementation works with existing Haskell
                 concurrency mechanisms, handles multiple communication
                 channels and recursive session types, and infers
                 protocols automatically.\par

                 While our implementation uses unsafe operations in
                 Haskell, it does not violate Haskell's safety
                 guarantees. We formalize this claim in a concurrent

                 long-standing problem of object initialization.
                 Constructors, the conventional mechanism for object
                 initialization, have semantics that are surprising to
                 programmers and that lead to bugs. They also contribute
                 to the problem of null-pointer exceptions, which make
                 software less reliable. Masked types are a new
                 type-state mechanism that explicitly tracks the
                 initialization state of objects and prevents reading
                 from uninitialized fields. In the resulting language,
                 constructors are ordinary methods that operate on
                 uninitialized objects, and no special default value
                 (null) is needed in the language. Initialization of
                 cyclic data structures is achieved with the use of
                 conditionally masked types. Masked types are modular
                 and compatible with data abstraction. The type system
                 is presented in a simplified object calculus and is
                 proved to soundly prevent reading from uninitialized
                 fields. Masked types have been implemented as an
                 extension to Java, in which compilation simply erases
                 extra type information. Experience using the extended
                 language suggests that masked types work well on real
                 code.",

                 extensible software systems. Recent work has separately
                 explored two different kinds of extensibility: first,
                 family inheritance, in which an entire family of
                 related classes can be inherited, and second,
                 adaptation, in which existing objects are extended in
                 place with new behavior and state. Class sharing
                 integrates these two kinds of extensibility mechanisms.
                 With little programmer effort, objects of one family
                 can be used as members of another, while preserving
                 relationships among objects. Therefore, a family of
                 classes can be adapted in place with new functionality
                 spanning multiple classes. Object graphs can evolve
                 from one family to another, adding or removing
                 functionality even at run time.\par

                 Several new mechanisms support this flexibility while
                 ensuring type safety. Class sharing has been
                 implemented as an extension to Java, and its utility

                 promising model for writing programs with powerful,
                 end-to-end security guarantees. Current DIFC systems
                 that run on commodity hardware can be broadly
                 categorized into two types: language-level and
                 operating system-level DIFC. Language level solutions
                 provide no guarantees against security violations on
                 system resources, like files and sockets. Operating
                 system solutions can mediate accesses to system
                 resources, but are inefficient at monitoring the flow
                 of information through fine-grained program data
                 structures.\par

                 This paper describes Laminar, the first system to
                 implement decentralized information flow control using
                 a single set of abstractions for OS resources and
                 heap-allocated objects. Programmers express security
                 policies by labeling data with secrecy and integrity
                 labels, and then access the labeled data in lexically
                 scoped security regions. Laminar enforces the security
                 policies specified by the labels at runtime. Laminar is
                 implemented using a modified Java virtual machine and a
                 new Linux security module. This paper shows that
                 security regions ease incremental deployment and limit
                 dynamic security checks, allowing us to retrofit DIFC
                 policies on four application case studies. Replacing
                 the applications' ad-hoc security policies changes less
                 than 10\% of the code, and incurs performance overheads
                 from 1\% to 56\%. Whereas prior DIFC systems only
                 support limited types of multithreaded programs,
                 Laminar supports a more general class of multithreaded
                 DIFC programs that can access heterogeneously labeled
                 data.",

                 extension of Java with the notion of {\em MyType},
                 which represents the type of a self reference and
                 changes its meaning along with inheritance. {\em
                 MyType\/} is useful to write extensible yet type-safe
                 classes for objects with recursive interfaces, that is,
                 ones with methods that take or return objects of the
                 same type as the receiver.\par

                 Although LOOJ has also generics, {\em MyType\/} has
                 been introduced as a feature rather orthogonal to
                 generics. As a result, LOOJ cannot express an interface
                 that refers to the same generic class recursively but
                 with different type arguments. This is a significant
                 limitation because such an interface naturally arises
                 in practice, for example, in a generic collection class
                 with method map(), which converts a collection to the
                 same kind of collection of a different element type.
                 Altherr and Cremet and Moors, Piessens, and Odersky
                 gave solutions to this problem but they used a highly
                 sophisticated combination of advanced mechanisms such
                 as abstract type members, higher-order type
                 constructors, and F-bounded polymorphism.\par

                 In this paper, we give another solution by introducing
                 {\em self type constructors}, which integrate {\em
                 MyType\/} and generics so that {\em MyType\/} can take
                 type arguments in a generic class. Self type
                 constructors are tailored to writing recursive
                 interfaces more concisely than previous solutions. We
                 demonstrate the expressive power of self type
                 constructors by means of examples, formalize a core
                 language with self type constructors, and prove its
                 type safety.",

  abstract =     "Many studies have shown that the best performer among
                 a set of garbage collectors tends to be different for
                 different applications. Researchers have proposed
                 applicationspecific selection of garbage collectors. In
                 this work, we concentrate on a second dimension of the
                 problem: the influence of program inputs on the
                 selection of garbage collectors. We collect tens to
                 hundreds of inputs for a set of Java benchmarks, and
                 measure their performance on Jikes RVM with different
                 heap sizes and garbage collectors. A rigorous
                 statistical analysis produces four-fold insights.
                 First, inputs influence the relative performance of
                 garbage collectors significantly, causing large
                 variations to the top set of garbage collectors across
                 inputs. Profiling one or few runs is thus inadequate
                 for selecting the garbage collector that works well for
                 most inputs. Second, when the heap size ratio is fixed,
                 one or two types of garbage collectors are enough to
                 stimulate the top performance of the program on all
                 inputs. Third, for some programs, the heap size ratio
                 significantly affects the relative performance of
                 different types of garbage collectors. For the
                 selection of garbage collectors on those programs, it
                 is necessary to have a cross-input predictive model
                 that predicts the minimum possible heap size of the
                 execution on an arbitrary input. Finally, by
                 adoptingstatistical learning techniques, we investigate
                 the cross-input predictability of the influence.
                 Experimental results demonstrate that with regression
                 and classification techniques, it is possible to
                 predict the best garbage collector (along with the
                 minimum possible heap size) with reasonable accuracy
                 given an arbitrary input to an application. The
                 exploration opens the opportunities for tailoring the
                 selection of garbage collectors to not only
                 applications but also their inputs.",

                 a platform-independent intermediate representation,
                 such as Java bytecode. The relative high level of Java
                 bytecode has engendered a widespread practice of
                 changing the bytecode directly, without modifying the
                 maintained version of the source code. This practice,
                 called {\em bytecode engineering\/} or {\em
                 enhancement}, has become indispensable in introducing
                 various concerns, including persistence, distribution,
                 and security, transparently. For example, transparent
                 persistence architectures help avoid the entanglement
                 of business and persistence logic in the source code by
                 changing the bytecode directly to synchronize objects
                 with stable storage. With functionality added directly
                 at the bytecode level, the source code reflects only
                 partial semantics of the program. Specifically, the
                 programmer can neither ascertain the program's runtime
                 behavior by browsing its source code, nor map the
                 runtime behavior back to the original source
                 code.\par

                 This paper presents an approach that improves the

                 enhancement specifications written in a domain-specific
                 language. By interpreting the specifications, a
                 source-level programming tool can gain an awareness of
                 the bytecode enhancements and improve its precision and
                 usability. We demonstrate the applicability of our
                 approach by making a source code editor and a symbolic

                 Stopping and restarting programs to apply changes is
                 inconvenient and often costly. Dynamic software
                 updating (DSU) addresses this problem by updating
                 programs while they execute, but existing DSU systems
                 for managed languages do not support many updates that
                 occur in practice and are inefficient. This paper
                 presents the design and implementation of Jvolve, a
                 DSU-enhanced Java VM. Updated programs may add, delete,
                 and replace fields and methods anywhere within the
                 class hierarchy. Jvolve implements these updates by
                 adding to and coordinating VM classloading,
                 just-in-time compilation, scheduling, return barriers,
                 on-stack replacement, and garbage collection. Jvolve,
                 is {\em safe\/}: its use of bytecode verification and
                 VM thread synchronization ensures that an update will
                 always produce type-correct executions. Jvolve is {\em
                 flexible\/}: it can support 20 of 22 updates to three
                 open-source programs--Jetty web server,

  abstract =     "J-Orchestra is a system that enhances centralized Java
                 programs with distribution capabilities. Operating at
                 the bytecode level, J-Orchestra transforms a
                 centralized Java program (i.e., running on a single
                 Java Virtual Machine (JVM)) into a distributed one
                 (i.e., running across multiple JVMs). This
                 transformation effectively separates distribution
                 concerns from the core functionality of a program.
                 J-Orchestra follows a semiautomatic transformation
                 process. Through a GUI, the user selects program
                 elements (at class granularity) and assigns them to
                 network locations. Based on the user's input, the
                 J-Orchestra backend {\em automatically partitions\/}
                 the program through compiler-level techniques, without
                 changes to the JVM or to the Java Runtime Environment
                 (JRE) classes. By means of bytecode engineering and
                 code generation, J-Orchestra substitutes method calls
                 with remote method calls, direct object references with
                 proxy references, etc. It also translates Java language
                 features (e.g., static methods and fields, inheritance,
                 inner classes, new object construction, etc.) for
                 efficient distributed execution.\par

                 We detail the main technical issues that J-Orchestra
                 addresses, including its mechanism for program
                 transformation in the presence of unmodifiable code
                 (e.g., in JRE classes) and the translation of
                 concurrency and synchronization constructs to work
                 correctly over the network. We further discuss a case
                 study of transforming a large, commercial, third-party
                 application for efficient execution in a client server
                 environment and outline the architectural
                 characteristics of centralized programs that are
                 amenable to automated distribution with J-Orchestra.",

  abstract =     "The growth in complexity of modern systems makes it
                 increasingly difficult to extract high-performance. The
                 software stacks for such systems typically consist of
                 multiple layers and include managed runtime
                 environments (MREs). In this paper, we investigate
                 techniques to improve cooperation between these layers
                 and the hardware to increase the efficacy of automatic
                 memory management in MREs.\par

                 General-purpose MREs commonly implement parallel and/or
                 concurrent garbage collection and employ compaction to
                 eliminate heap fragmentation. Moreover, most systems
                 trigger collection based on the amount of heap a
                 program uses. Our analysis shows that in many cases
                 this strategy leads to ineffective collections that are
                 unable to reclaim sufficient space to justify the
                 incurred cost. To avoid such collections, we exploit
                 the observation that dead objects tend to cluster
                 together and form large, never-referenced, regions in
                 the address space that correlate well with virtual
                 pages that have not recently been referenced by the
                 application. We leverage this correlation to design a
                 new, simple and light-weight, yield predictor that
                 estimates the amount of reclaimable space in the heap
                 using hardware page reference bits. Our predictor
                 allows MREs to avoid low-yield collections and thereby
                 improve resource management.\par

                 We integrate this predictor into three state-of-the-art

  abstract =     "Many large-scale Java applications suffer from runtime
                 bloat. They execute large volumes of methods, and
                 create many temporary objects, all to execute
                 relatively simple operations. There are large
                 opportunities for performance optimizations in these
                 applications, but most are being missed by existing
                 optimization and tooling technology. While JIT
                 optimizations struggle for a few percent, performance
                 experts analyze deployed applications and regularly
                 find gains of 2x or more.\par

                 Finding such big gains is difficult, for both humans
                 and compilers, because of the diffuse nature of runtime
                 bloat. Time is spread thinly across calling contexts,
                 making it difficult to judge how to improve
                 performance. Bloat results from a pile-up of seemingly
                 harmless decisions. Each adds temporary objects and
                 method calls, and often copies values between those
                 temporary objects. While data copies are not the
                 entirety of bloat, we have observed that they are
                 excellent indicators of regions of excessive activity.
                 By optimizing copies, one is likely to remove the
                 objects that carry copied values, and the method calls
                 that allocate and populate them.\par

                 We introduce {\em copy profiling}, a technique that
                 summarizes runtime activity in terms of chains of data
                 copies. A flat copy profile counts copies by method. We
                 show how flat profiles alone can be helpful. In many
                 cases, diagnosing a problem requires data flow context.
                 Tracking and making sense of raw copy chains does not
                 scale, so we introduce a summarizing abstraction called
                 the {\em copy graph}. We implement three clients
                 analyses that, using the copy graph, expose common
                 patterns of bloat, such as finding hot copy chains and
                 discovering temporary data structures. We demonstrate,
                 with examples from a large-scale commercial application
                 and several benchmarks, that copy profiling can be used
                 by a programmer to quickly find opportunities for large
                 performance gains.",

  abstract =     "We present an integrated proof language for guiding
                 the actions of multiple reasoning systems as they work
                 together to prove complex correctness properties of
                 imperative programs. The language operates in the
                 context of a program verification system that uses
                 multiple reasoning systems to discharge generated proof
                 obligations. It is designed to 1) enable developers to
                 resolve key choice points in complex program
                 correctness proofs, thereby enabling automated
                 reasoning systems to successfully prove the desired
                 correctness properties; 2) allow developers to identify
                 key lemmas for the reasoning systems to prove, thereby
                 guiding the reasoning systems to find an effective
                 proof decomposition; 3) enable multiple reasoning
                 systems to work together productively to prove a single
                 correctness property by providing a mechanism that
                 developers can use to divide the property into lemmas,
                 each of which is suitable for a different reasoning
                 system; and 4) enable developers to identify specific
                 lemmas that the reasoning systems should use when
                 attempting to prove other lemmas or correctness
                 properties, thereby appropriately confining the search
                 space so that the reasoning systems can find a proof in
                 an acceptable amount of time.\par

                 The language includes a rich set of declarative proof
                 constructs that enables developers to direct the
                 reasoning systems as little or as much as they desire.
                 Because the declarative proof statements are embedded
                 into the program as specialized comments, they also
                 serve as verified documentation and are a natural
                 extension of the assertion mechanism found in most
                 program verification systems.\par

                 We have implemented our integrated proof language in
                 the context of a program verification system for Java
                 and used the resulting system to verify a collection of
                 linked data structure implementations. Our experience
                 indicates that our proof language makes it possible to
                 successfully prove complex program correctness
                 properties that are otherwise beyond the reach of
                 automated reasoning systems.",

  abstract =     "Multi-core processors are widely used in computer
                 systems. As the performance of microprocessors greatly
                 exceeds that of memory, the memory wall becomes a
                 limiting factor. It is important to understand how the
                 large disparity of speed between processor and memory
                 influences the performance and scalability of Java
                 applications on emerging multi-core platforms.\par

                 In this paper, we studied two popular Java benchmarks,
                 SPECjbb2005 and SPECjvm2008, on multi-core platforms
                 including Intel Clovertown and AMD Phenom. We focus on
                 the 'partially scalable' benchmark programs. With
                 smaller number of CPU cores these programs scale
                 perfectly, but when more cores and software threads are
                 used, the slope of the scalability curve degrades
                 dramatically.\par

                 We identified a strong correlation between scalability,
                 object allocation rate and memory bus write traffic in
                 our experiments with our partially scalable programs.
                 We find that these applications allocate large amounts
                 of memory and consume almost all the memory write
                 bandwidth in our hardware platforms. Because the write
                 bandwidth is so limited, we propose the following
                 hypothesis: the scalability and performance is limited
                 by the object allocation on emerging multi-core
                 platforms for those objects-allocation intensive Java
                 applications, as if these applications are running into
                 an 'allocation wall'.\par

                 In order to verify this hypothesis, several experiments
                 are performed, including measuring key architecture
                 level metrics, composing a micro-benchmark program, and
                 studying the effect of modifying some of the 'partially
                 scalable' programs. All the experiments strongly
                 suggest the existence of the allocation wall.",
