   ABSTRACT     = {Many reverse-engineering techniques in systems biology 
      rely upon data on steady-state (or dynamic) perturbations --obtained 
      from siRNA, gene knock-down or overexpression, kinase and phosphatase 
      inhibitors, or other interventions-- in order to understand the 
      interactions between different ``modules'' in a network. This paper 
      first reviews one such popular such technique, introduced by the 
      author and collaborators, and focuses on why conclusions drawn from 
      its use may be misleading due to ``retroactivity'' (impedance or 
      load) effects. A theoretical result characterizing 
      stoichiometric-induced steady-state retroactivity effects is given 
      for a class of biochemical networks.}

   ABSTRACT     = {In this paper, we introduce a topological redundancy 
      measure for labeled directed networks that is formal, computationally 
      efficient and applicable to a variety of directed networks such as 
      cellular signaling, metabolic and social interaction networks. We 
      demonstrate the computational efficiency of our measure by computing 
      its value and statistical significance on a number of biological and 
      social networks with up to several thousands of nodes and edges. Our 
      results suggest a number of interesting observations: (1) social 
      networks are more redundant that their biological counterparts, (2) 
      transcriptional networks are less redundant than signaling networks, 
      (3) the topological redundancy of the C. elegans metabolic network is 
      largely due to its inclusion of currency metabolites, and (4) the 
      redundancy of signaling networks is highly (negatively) correlated 
      with monotonicity of their dynamics.}

      conditions for persistence of certain classes of networks are

   ABSTRACT     = {Natural and synthetic biological networks must function 
      reliably in the face of fluctuating stoichiometry of their molecular 
      components. These fluctuations are caused in part by changes in 
      relative expression efficiency and the DNA template amount of the 
      network-coding genes. Gene product levels could potentially be 
      decoupled from these changes via built-in adaptation mechanisms, 
      thereby boosting network reliability. Here we show that a mechanism 
      based on an incoherent feed-forward motif enables adaptive gene 
      expression in mammalian cells. We modeled, synthesized, and tested 
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional incoherent loops and found 
      that in all cases the gene product adapts to changes in DNA template 
      abundance. We also observed that the post-transcriptional form 
      results in superior adaptation behavior, higher absolute expression 
      levels, and lower intrinsic fluctuations. Our results support a 
      previously-hypothesized endogenous role in gene dosage compensation 
      for such motifs and suggest that their incorporation in synthetic 
      networks will improve their robustness and reliability.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Often, the ultimate goal of regulation is to maintain a 
      narrow range of concentration levels of vital quantities 
      (homeostasis, adaptation) while at the same time appropriately 
      reacting to changes in the environment (signal detection or 
      sensitivity). Much theoretical, modeling, and analysis effort has 
      been devoted to the understanding of these questions, traditionally 
      in the context of steady-state responses to constant or step-changing 
      stimuli. In this paper, we present a new theorem that provides a 
      necessary and sufficient characterization of invariance of transient 
      responses to symmetries in inputs. A particular example of this 
      property, scale-invariance (a.k.a. "fold change detection"), appears 
      to be exhibited by biological sensory systems ranging from bacterial 
      chemotaxis pathways to signal transduction mechanisms in eukaryotes. 
      The new characterization amounts to the solvability of an associated 
      partial differential equation. It is framed in terms of a notion 
      which considerably extends equivariant actions of compact Lie groups. 
      For several simple system motifs that are recurrent in biology, the 
      solvability criterion may be checked explicitly.}

      interconnected MIMO orthant-monotone systems for which no matching 
      condition is required between the partial orders in input and output 
      spaces of the considered subsystems. Previous results assumed that 
      the partial orders adopted would be induced by positivity cones in 
      input and output spaces and that such positivity cones should fulfill 
      a compatibility rule: namely either be coincident or be opposite. 
      Those two configurations corresponded to positive-feedback or 
      negative feedback cases. We relax those results by allowing arbitrary 
      orthant orders.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Certain cellular sensory systems display fold-change 
      detection (FCD): a response whose entire shape, including amplitude 
      and duration, depends only on fold-changes in input, and not on 
      absolute changes. Thus, a step change in input from, say, level 1 to 
      2, gives precisely the same dynamical output as a step from level 2 
      to 4, since the steps have the same fold-change. We ask what is the 
      benefit of FCD, and show that FCD is necessary and sufficient for 
      sensory search to be independent of multiplying the input-field by a 
      scalar. Thus the FCD search pattern depends only on the spatial 
      profile of the input, and not on its amplitude. Such scalar symmetry 
      occurs in a wide range of sensory inputs, such as source strength 
      multiplying diffusing/convecting chemical fields sensed in 
      chemotaxis, ambient light multiplying the contrast field in vision, 
      and protein concentrations multiplying the output in cellular 
      signaling-systems.Furthermore, we demonstrate that FCD entails two 
      features found across sensory systems, exact adaptation and Weber's 
      law, but that these two features are not sufficient for FCD. Finally, 
      we present a wide class of mechanisms that have FCD, including 
      certain non-linear feedback and feedforward loops.. We find that 
      bacterial chemotaxis displays feedback within the present class, and 
      hence is expected to show FCD. This can explain experiments in which 
      chemotaxis searches are insensitive to attractant source levels. This 
      study thus suggests a connection between properties of biological 
      sensory systems and scalar symmetry stemming from physical properties 
      of their input-fields.}

   ABSTRACT     = {The concept of robustness of regulatory networks has 
      been closely related to the nature of the interactions among genes, 
      and the capability of pattern maintenance or reproducibility. 
      Defining this robustness property is a challenging task, but 
      mathematical models have often associated it to the volume of the 
      space of admissible parameters. Not only the volume of the space but 
      also its topology and geometry contain information on essential 
      aspects of the network, including feasible pathways, switching 
      between two parallel pathways or distinct/disconnected active regions 
      of parameters. A method is presented here to characterize the space 
      of admissible parameters, by writing it as a semi-algebraic set, and 
      then theoretically analyzing its topology and geometry, as well as 
      volume. This method provides a more objective and complete measure of 
      the robustness of a developmental module. As a detailed case study, 
      the segment polarity gene network is analyzed. }

      received much attention in the last decade. One measure of robustness 
      has been associated with the volume of the feasible region, namely, 
      the region in the parameter space in which the system is functional. 
      In recent work, we emphasized that topology and geometry matter, as 
      well as volume. In this paper, and using the segment polarity gene 
      network to illustrate our approach, we show that random walks in 
      parameter space and how they exit the feasible region provide a rich 
      perspective on the different modes of failure of a model. In 
      particular, for the segment polarity network, we found that, between 
      two alternative ways of activating Wingless, one is more robust. Our 
      method provides a more complete measure of robustness to parameter 
      variation. As a general modeling strategy, our approach is an 
      interesting alternative to Boolean representation of biochemical 
      networks. }

   ABSTRACT     = {During normal kidney function, there are are routinely 
      wide swings in proximal tubule fluid flow and proportional changes in 
      Na+ reabsorption across tubule epithelial cells. This 
      "glomerulotubular balance" occurs in the absence of any substantial 
      change in cell volume, and is thus a challenge to coordinate luminal 
      membrane solute entry with peritubular membrane solute exit. In this 
      work, linear optimal control theory is applied to generate a 
      configuration of regulated transporters that could achieve this 
      result. A previously developed model of rat proximal tubule 
      epithelium is linearized about a physiologic reference condition; the 
      approximate linear system is recast as a dynamical system; and a 
      Riccati equation is solved to yield optimal linear feedback that 
      stabilizes Na+ flux, cell volume, and cell pH. This optimal feedback 
      control is largely consigned to three physiologic variables, cell 
      volume, cell electrical potential, and lateral intercellular 
      hydrostatic pressure. Transport modulation by cell volume stabilizes 
      cell volume; transport modulation by electrical potential or 
      interspace pressure act to stabilize Na+ flux and cell pH. This 
      feedback control is utilized in a tracking problem, in which 
      reabsorptive Na+ flux varies over a factor of two. The resulting 
      control parameters consist of two terms, an autonomous term and a 
      feedback term, and both terms include transporters on both luminal 
      and peritubular cell membranes. Overall, the increase in Na+ flux is 
      achieved with upregulation of luminal Na+/H+ exchange and Na+-glucose 
      cotransport, with increased peritubular Na+-3HCO_3- and K+-Cl- 
      cotransport, and with increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The 
      configuration of activated transporters emerges as testable 
      hypothesis of the molecular basis for glomerulotubular balance. It is 
      suggested that the autonomous control component at each cell membrane 
      could represent the cytoskeletal effects of luminal flow. }

      global asymptotic stability, and in particular no oscillations, if 
      the rate of transcription is somewhat smaller than that assumed by 
      Goldbeter, based on the application of a tight small gain condition. 
      This stability persists even under arbitrary delays in the feedback 
      loop. On the other hand, when the condition is violated a 
      Poincare'-Bendixson result allows to conclude existence of 
      oscillations, for sufficiently high delays.}

      stability of the network from the diagonal stability of a 
      "dissipativity matrix" which incorporates information about the 
      passivity properties of the subsystems, the interconnection structure 
      of the network, and the signs of the interconnection terms. This 
      stability test encompasses the "secant criterion" for cyclic networks 
      presented in our previous paper, and extends it to a general 
      interconnection structure represented by a graph. A second main 
      result allows one to accommodate state products. This extension makes 
      the new stability criterion applicable to a broader class of models, 
      even in the case of cyclic systems. The new stability test is 
      illustrated on a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade 
      model, and on a branched interconnection structure motivated by 
      metabolic networks. Finally, another result addresses the robustness 
      of stability in the presence of diffusion terms in a compartmental 
      system made out of identical systems.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Modularity plays a fundamental role in the prediction of 
      the behavior of a system from the behavior of its components, 
      guaranteeing that the properties of individual components do not 
      change upon interconnection. Just as electrical, hydraulic, and other 
      physical systems often do not display modularity, nor do many 
      biochemical systems, and specifically, genetic networks. Here, we 
      study the effect of interconnections on the input/output dynamic 
      characteristics of transcriptional components, focusing on a 
      property, which we call "retroactivity," that plays a role analogous 
      to non-zero output impedance in electrical systems. In 
      transcriptional networks, retroactivity is large when the amount of 
      transcription factor is comparable to, or smaller than, the amount of 
      promoter binding sites, or when the affinity of such binding sites is 
      high. In order to attenuate the effect of retroactivity, we propose a 
      feedback mechanism inspired by the design of amplifiers in 
      electronics. We introduce, in particular, a mechanism based on a 
      phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle. This mechanism enjoys a 
      remarkable insulation property, due to the fast time scales of the 
      phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Such a mechanism, 
      when viewed as a signal transduction system, has thus an inherent 
      capacity to provide insulation and hence to increase the modularity 
      of the system in which it is placed.}

   ABSTRACT     = {A class of distributed systems with a cyclic 
      interconnection structure is considered. These systems arise in 
      several biochemical applications and they can undergo diffusion 
      driven instability which leads to a formation of spatially 
      heterogeneous patterns. In this paper, a class of cyclic systems in 
      which addition of diffusion does not have a destabilizing effect is 
      identified. For these systems global stability results hold if the 
      "secant" criterion is satisfied. In the linear case, it is shown that 
      the secant condition is necessary and sufficient for the existence of 
      a decoupled quadratic Lyapunov function, which extends a recent 
      diagonal stability result to partial differential equations. For 
      reaction-diffusion equations with nondecreasing coupling 
      nonlinearities global asymptotic stability of the origin is 
      established. All of the derived results remain true for both linear 
      and nonlinear positive diffusion terms. Similar results are shown for 
      compartmental systems.}

      loops than negative loops. Negative inconsistent loops can be more 
      easily removed from real regulatory network topologies compared to 
      removing negative loops from shuffled networks. The abundance of 
      positive feed-forward loops and feedback loops in real networks 
      emerges from the presence of hubs that are enriched with either 
      negative or positive links, and from the non-uniform connectivity 
      distribution. Boolean dynamics applied to the signaling network 
      further support the stability of its topology. These observations 
      suggest that the "close-to-monotone" structure of intracellular 
      regulatory networks may contribute to the dynamical stability

   ABSTRACT     = { The ``reverse engineering problem'' in systems biology 
      is that of unraveling of the web of interactions among the components 
      of protein and gene regulatory networks, so as to map out the direct 
      or local interactions among components. These direct interactions 
      capture the topology of the functional network. An intrinsic 
      difficulty in capturing these direct interactions, at least in intact 
      cells, is that any perturbation to a particular gene or signaling 
      component may rapidly propagate throughout the network, thus causing 
      global changes which cannot be easily distinguished from direct 
      effects. Thus, a major goal in reverse engineering is to use these 
      observed global responses - such as steady-state changes in 
      concentrations of active proteins, mRNA levels, or transcription 
      rates - in order to infer the local interactions between individual 
      nodes. One approach to solving this global-to-local problem is the 
      ``Modular Response Analysis'' (MRA) method proposed in work of the 
      author with Kholodenko et. al. (PNAS, 2002) and further elaborated in 
      other papers. The basic method deals only with steady-state data. 
      However, recently, quasi-steady state MRA has been used by Santos et. 
      al. (Nature Cell Biology, 2007) for quantifying positive and negative 
      feedback effects in the Raf/Mek/Erk MAPK network in rat adrenal 
      pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells. This paper presents an overview of 
      the MRA technique, as well as a generalization of the algorithm to 
      that quasi-steady state case. }

   ABSTRACT     = {Feedback loops play an important role in determining the 
      dynamics of biological networks. In order to study the role of 
      negative feedback loops, this paper introduces the notion of 
      "distance to positive feedback (PF-distance)" which in essence 
      captures the number of "independent" negative feedback loops in the 
      network, a property inherent in the network topology. Through a 
      computational study using Boolean networks it is shown that 
      PF-distance has a strong influence on network dynamics and correlates 
      very well with the number and length of limit cycles in the phase 
      space of the network. To be precise, it is shown that, as the number 
      of independent negative feedback loops increases, the number (length) 
      of limit cycles tends to decrease (increase). These conclusions are 
      consistent with the fact that certain natural biological networks 
      exhibit generally regular behavior and have fewer negative feedback 
      loops than randomized networks with the same numbers of nodes and 
      connectivity. }

      (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n is even) 
      or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1 
      steady states (so, for n=2, there are no more than 3 steady states); 
      (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady 
      state conditions, there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for 
      parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state 
      conditions, there is at most one steady state.}

   ABSTRACT     = {The theory of monotone dynamical systems has been found 
      very useful in the modeling of some gene, protein, and signaling 
      networks. In monotone systems, every net feedback loop is positive. 
      On the other hand, negative feedback loops are important features of 
      many systems, since they are required for adaptation and precision. 
      This paper shows that, provided that these negative loops act at a 
      comparatively fast time scale, the main dynamical property of 
      (strongly) monotone systems, convergence to steady states, is still 
      valid. An application is worked out to a double-phosphorylation 
      "futile cycle" motif which plays a central role in eukaryotic cell 
      signaling.}

   ABSTRACT     = {The proper function of many biological systems requires 
      that external perturbations be detected, allowing the system to adapt 
      to these environmental changes. It is now well established that this 
      dual detection and adaptation requires that the system have an 
      internal model in the feedback loop. In this paper we relax the 
      requirement that the response of the system adapt perfectly, but 
      instead allow regulation to within a neighborhood of zero. We show, 
      in a nonlinear setting, that systems with the ability to detect input 
      signals and approximately adapt require an approximate model of the 
      input. We illustrate our results by analyzing a well-studied 
      biological system. These results generalize previous work which 
      treats the perfectly adapting case. }

      of the algorithms, which has a worst-case guarantee of 87.9% from 
      optimality, is based on the semidefinite programming relaxation

      continuous input streams, provided that these computations can be

      article the computational capability of such circuits in the more 
      realistic case where not only readout neurons, but in addition a few 
      neurons within the circuit have been trained for specific tasks. This 
      is essentially equivalent to the case where the output of trained 
      readout neurons is fed back into the circuit. We show that this new 
      model overcomes the limitation of a rapidly fading memory. In fact, 
      we prove that in the idealized case without noise it can carry out 
      any conceivable digital or analog computation on time-varying inputs. 
      But even with noise the resulting computational model can perform a 
      large class of biologically relevant real-time computations that 
      require a non-fading memory. }

      that every solution converges to some steady state. The reaction 
      kinetics are assumed to be monotone but otherwise arbitrary. When 
      diffusion effects are taken into account, the conclusions remain 
      unchanged. The main tools used in our analysis come from the theory 
      of monotone dynamical systems. We review some of the features of this 
      theory and provide a self-contained proof of a particular 
      attractivity result which is used in proving our main result. },

      local stability, derived earlier in the literature, is in fact a 
      necessary and sufficient condition for diagonal stability of the 
      corresponding class of matrices. We then revisit a recent 
      generalization of this criterion to output strictly passive systems, 
      and recover the same stability condition using our diagonal stability 
      result as a tool for constructing a Lyapunov function. Using this 
      procedure for Lyapunov construction we exhibit classes of cyclic 
      systems with sector nonlinearities and characterize their global 
      stability properties. }

   ABSTRACT     = { A commonly employed measure of the signal amplification 
      properties of an input/output system is its induced L2 norm, 
      sometimes also known as H-infinity gain. In general, however, it is 
      extremely difficult to compute the numerical value for this norm, or 
      even to check that it is finite, unless the system being studied is 
      linear. This paper describes a class of systems for which it is 
      possible to reduce this computation to that of finding the norm of an 
      associated linear system. In contrast to linearization approaches, a 
      precise value, not an estimate, is obtained for the full nonlinear 
      model. The class of systems that we study arose from the modeling of 
      certain biological intracellular signaling cascades, but the results 
      should be of wider applicability. }

   ABSTRACT     = { As a discrete approach to genetic regulatory networks, 
      Boolean models provide an essential qualitative description of the 
      structure of interactions among genes and proteins. Boolean models 
      generally assume only two possible states (expressed or not 
      expressed) for each gene or protein in the network as well as a high 
      level of synchronization among the various regulatory processes. In 
      this paper, we discuss and compare two possible methods of adapting 
      qualitative models to incorporate the continuous-time character of 
      regulatory networks. The first method consists of introducing 
      asynchronous updates in the Boolean model. In the second method, we 
      adopt the approach introduced by L. Glass to obtain a set of 
      piecewise linear differential equations which continuously describe 
      the states of each gene or protein in the network. We apply both 
      methods to a particular example: a Boolean model of the segment 
      polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster. We analyze the 
      dynamics of the model, and provide a theoretical characterization of 
      the model's gene pattern prediction as a function of the timescales 
      of the various processes. }

      which the continuous search space is partitioned into a finite 
      collection of regions on which we define a discrete search problem 
      and a solution to the original problem is obtained through a 
      refinement procedure that lifts the discrete path into a continuous 
      one. The resulting solution is in general not optimal but one can 
      construct bounds to gauge the cost penalty incurred. The discrete 
      version is formalized and an optimization problem is stated as a 
      `reward-collecting' bounded-length path problem. NP-completeness and 
      efficient approximation algorithms for various cases of this problem

   ABSTRACT     = { Biological complexity and limited quantitative 
      measurements impose severe challenges to standard engineering 
      methodologies for systems identification. This paper presents an 
      approach, justified by the theory of universal inputs for 
      distinguishability, based on replacing unmodeled dynamics by 
      fictitious `dependent inputs'. The approach is particularly useful in 
      validation experiments, because it allows one to fit model parameters 
      to experimental data generated by a reference (wild-type) organism 
      and then testing this model on data generated by a variation 
      (mutant), so long as the mutations only affect the unmodeled dynamics 
      that produce the dependent inputs. As a case study, this paper 
      addresses the pathways that control the nitrogen uptake fluxes in 
      baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae enabling it to optimally 
      respond to changes in nitrogen availability. Well-defined 
      perturbation experiments were performed on cells growing in 
      steady-state. Time-series data of extracellular and intracellular 
      metabolites were obtained, as well as mRNA levels. A nonlinear model 
      was proposed, and shown to be structurally identifiable given 
      input/output data. The identified model correctly predicted the 
      responses of different yeast strains and different perturbations. }

      Here we propose a framework for gene regulatory networks that 
      combines the intuitive appeal of a qualitative description of gene 
      states with a high flexibility in incorporating stochasticity in the 
      duration of cellular processes. We apply our methods to the 
      regulatory network of the segment polarity genes, thus gaining novel 
      insights into the development of gene expression patterns. For 
      example, we show that very short synthesis and decay times can 
      perturb the wild type pattern. On the other hand, separation of 
      timescales between pre- and post-translational processes and a 
      minimal prepattern ensure convergence to the wild type expression 
      pattern regardless of fluctuations. }

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper deals with an almost global attractivity 
      result for Lotka-Volterra systems with predator-prey interactions. 
      These systems can be written as (negative) feedback systems. The 
      subsystems of the feedback loop are monotone control systems, 
      possessing particular input-output properties. We use a small-gain 
      theorem, adapted to a context of systems with multiple equilibrium 
      points to obtain the desired almost global attractivity result. It 
      provides sufficient conditions to rule out oscillatory or more 
      complicated behavior which is often observed in predator-prey 
      systems. }

   ABSTRACT     = { Multistability is an important recurring theme in cell 
      signaling, of particular relevance to biological systems that switch 
      between discrete states, generate oscillatory responses, or 
      "remember" transitory stimuli. Standard mathematical methods allow 
      the detection of bistability in some very simple feedback systems 
      (systems with one or two proteins or genes that either activate each 
      other or inhibit each other), but realistic depictions of signal 
      transduction networks are invariably much more complex than this. 
      Here we show that for a class of feedback systems of arbitrary order, 
      the stability properties of the system can be deduced mathematically 
      from how the system behaves when feedback is blocked. Provided that 
      this "open loop," feedback-blocked system is monotone and possesses a 
      sigmoidal characteristic, the system is guaranteed to be bistable for 
      some range of feedback strengths. We present a simple graphical 
      method for deducing the stability behavior and bifurcation diagrams 
      for such systems, and illustrate the method with two examples taken 
      from recent experimental studies of bistable systems: a two-variable 
      Cdc2/Wee1 system and a more complicated five-variable MAPK cascade. },

      among genes, proteins, and metabolites by monitoring time-dependent 
      responses of cellular networks to experimental interventions. We show 
      that all connections leading to a given network node, e.g., to a 
      particular gene, can be deduced from responses to perturbations none 
      of which directly influences that node, e.g., using strains with 
      knock-outs to other genes. To infer all interactions from stationary 
      data, each node should be perturbed separately or in combination with 
      other nodes. Monitoring time series provides richer information and 
      does not require perturbations to all nodes. },

   ABSTRACT     = { We show how certain properties of Goldbeter's original 
      1995 model for circadian oscillations can be proved mathematically. 
      We establish global asymptotic stability, and in particular no 
      oscillations, if the rate of transcription is somewhat smaller than 
      that assumed by Goldbeter, but, on the other hand, this stability 
      persists even under arbitrary delays in the feedback loop. We are 
      mainly interested in illustrating certain mathematical techniques, 
      including the use of theorems concerning tridiagonal cooperative 
      systems and the recently developed theory of monotone systems with 
      inputs and outputs. }

   ABSTRACT     = { Monotone systems are dynamical systems for which the 
      flow preserves a partial order. Some applications will be briefly 
      reviewed in this paper. Much of the appeal of the class of monotone 
      systems stems from the fact that roughly, most solutions converge to 
      the set of equilibria. However, this usually requires a stronger 
      monotonicity property which is not always satisfied or easy to check 
      in applications. Following work of J.F. Jiang, we show that 
      monotonicity is enough to conclude global attractivity if there is a 
      unique equilibrium and if the state space satisfies a particular 
      condition. The proof given here is self-contained and does not 
      require the use of any of the results from the theory of monotone 
      systems. We will illustrate it on a class of chemical reaction 
      networks with monotone, but otherwise arbitrary, reaction kinetics. }

      question arises as to how the required fine-tuning may be achieved

      using tools from nonlinear and adaptive control theory. We illustrate 
      our approach on a simple model which captures some of the essential 
      features of neural integration. As a result, we propose a large class 
      of feedback adaptation rules that may be responsible for the 
      experimentally observed robustness of neural integration. We mention 
      extensions of our approach to the case of hair cell oscillations in

   ABSTRACT     = { In the early embryonic cell cycle, Cdc2-cyclin B 
      functions like an autonomous oscillator, at whose core is a negative 
      feedback loop: cyclins accumulate and produce active mitotic 
      Cdc2-cyclin B Cdc2 activates the anaphase-promoting complex (APC); 
      the APC then promotes cyclin degradation and resets Cdc2 to its 
      inactive, interphase state. Cdc2 regulation also involves positive 
      feedback4, with active Cdc2-cyclin B stimulating its activator Cdc25 
      and inactivating its inhibitors Wee1 and Myt1. Under the correct 
      circumstances, these positive feedback loops could function as a 
      bistable trigger for mitosis, and oscillators with bistable triggers 
      may be particularly relevant to biological applications such as cell 
      cycle regulation. This paper examined whether Cdc2 activation is 
      bistable, confirming that the response of Cdc2 to non-degradable 
      cyclin B is temporally abrupt and switchlike, as would be expected if 
      Cdc2 activation were bistable. It is also shown that Cdc2 activation 
      exhibits hysteresis, a property of bistable systems with particular 
      relevance to biochemical oscillators. These findings help establish 
      the basic systems-level logic of the mitotic oscillator. },

      systems at a mechanistic level, or applied within a modular 
      framework, which dramatically decreases the number of variables to be 
      assayed. The topology and strength of network connections are 
      retrieved from experimentally measured network responses to 
      successive perturbations of all modules. In addition, the method can 
      reveal functional interactions even when the components of the system 
      are not all known, in which casesome connections retrieved by the 
      analysis will not be direct but correspond to the interaction routes 
      through unidentified elements. The method is tested and illustrated 
      using computer-generated responses of a modeled MAPK cascade and gene

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper introduces and studies a new definition of 
      the minimum-phase property for general smooth nonlinear control 
      systems. The definition does not rely on a particular choice of 
      coordinates in which the system takes a normal form or on the 
      computation of zero dynamics. In the spirit of the ``input-to-state 
      stability'' philosophy, it requires the state and the input of the 
      system to be bounded by a suitable function of the output and 
      derivatives of the output, modulo a decaying term depending on 
      initial conditions. The class of minimum-phase systems thus defined 
      includes all affine systems in global normal form whose internal 
      dynamics are input-to-state stable and also all left-invertible 
      linear systems whose transmission zeros have negative real parts. As 
      an application, we explain how the new concept enables one to develop 
      a natural extension to nonlinear systems of a basic result from 
      linear adaptive control. }

      compact intervals. In a recent paper of ours, a complementary result

      theorem to the inclusions whose state spaces are Banach spaces. To 
      illustrate the motivations for studying such approximation results, 
      we briefly discuss a quick application of the result to output 
      stability and uniform output stability properties. }

   ABSTRACT     = { For systems whose output is to be kept small (thought 
      of as an error output), the notion of input to output stability (IOS) 
      arises. Alternatively, when considering a system whose output is 
      meant to provide information about the state (i.e. a measurement 
      output), one arrives at the detectability notion of output to state 
      stability (OSS). Combining these concepts, one may consider a system 
      with two types of outputs, an error and a measurement. This leads 
      naturally to a notion of partial detectability which we call 
      measurement to error stability (MES). This property characterizes 
      systems in which the error signal is detectable through the 
      measurement signal. This paper provides a partial Lyapunov 
      characterization of the MES property. A closely related property of 
      stability in three measures (SIT) is introduced, which characterizes 
      systems for which the error decays whenever it dominates the 
      measurement. The SIT property is shown to imply MES, and the two are 
      shown to be equivalent under an additional boundedness assumption. A 
      nonsmooth Lyapunov characterization of the SIT property is provided, 
      which yields the partial characterization of MES. The analysis is 
      carried out on systems described by differential inclusions -- 
      implicitly incorporating a disturbance input with compact value-set. }

      June 9, 2000.) The input to state stability (ISS) paradigm is 
      motivated as a generalization of classical linear systems concepts 
      under coordinate changes. A summary is provided of the main 
      theoretical results concerning ISS and related notions of 
      input/output stability and detectability. A bibliography is also 
      included, listing extensions, applications, and other current work. }

   ABSTRACT     = { The area of hybrid systems concerns issues of modeling, 
      computation, and control for systems which combine discrete and 
      continuous components. The subclass of piecewise linear (PL) systems 
      provides one systematic approach to discrete-time hybrid systems, 
      naturally blending switching mechanisms with classical linear 
      components. PL systems model arbitrary interconnections of finite 
      automata and linear systems. Tools from automata theory, logic, and 
      related areas of computer science and finite mathematics are used in 
      the study of PL systems, in conjunction with linear algebra 
      techniques, all in the context of a "PL algebra" formalism. PL 
      systems are of interest as controllers as well as identification 
      models. Basic questions for any class of systems are those of 
      equivalence, and, in particular, if state spaces are equivalent under 
      a change of variables. This paper studies this state-space 
      equivalence problem for PL systems. The problem was known to be 
      decidable, but its computational complexity was potentially 
      exponential; here it is shown to be solvable in polynomial-time. },

      a ``bounded energy bounded state'' requirement and the global

      IISS is shown to imply the global version, though a counterexample

      Similar Lyapunov characterizations have been found to play a key role 
      in the analysis of the input to state stability property, and the

      dynamic, i.e., their weight changes on a short time scale by several 
      hundred percent in dependence of the past input to the synapse. In 
      this article we explore the consequences that this synaptic dynamics 
      entails for the computational power of feedforward neural networks. 
      It turns out that even with just a single hidden layer such networks 
      can approximate a surprisingly large large class of nonlinear 
      filters: all filters that can be characterized by Volterra series. 
      This result is robust with regard to various changes in the model for 
      synaptic dynamics. Furthermore we show that simple gradient descent 
      suffices to approximate a given quadratic filter by a rather small 
      neural system with dynamic synapses. }

      (Artstein's theorem) is the equivalence, for systems affine in

      This equivalence breaks down for general nonlinear systems, not

      that the existence of smooth Lyapunov functions implies the existence 
      of (in general, discontinuous) feedback stabilizers which are 
      insensitive to small errors in state measurements. Conversely, it is 
      shown that the existence of such stabilizers in turn implies the 
      existence of smooth control Lyapunov functions. Moreover, it is 
      established that, for general nonlinear control systems under 
      persistently acting disturbances, the existence of smooth Lyapunov 
      functions is equivalent to the existence of (possibly) discontinuous) 
      feedback stabilizers which are robust with respect to small 
      measurement errors and small additive external disturbances. }

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper continues the investigation of the recently 
      introduced integral version of input-to-state stability (iISS). We 
      study the problem of designing control laws that achieve iISS 
      disturbance attenuation. The main contribution is an appropriate 
      concept of control Lyapunov function (iISS-CLF), whose existence 
      leads to an explicit construction of such a control law. The results 
      are compared and contrasted with the ones available for the ISS case. }

      1997, presents a brief introduction, establishes various elementary

      the learning and estimation-theoretic applications of VC dimension,

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper provides lower and upper bounds for the VC

      two independent parameters: the number w of weights in the network, 
      and the length k of the input sequence. Ignoring multiplicative 
      constants, the main results say roughly the following: 1. For 
      architectures whose activation is any fixed nonlinear polynomial, the 
      VC dimension is proportional to wk. 2. For architectures whose 
      activation is any fixed piecewise polynomial, the VC dimension is 
      between wk and w**2k. 3. For architectures with threshold 
      activations, the VC dimension is between wlog(k/w) and the smallest 
      of wklog(wk) and w**2+wlog(wk). 4. For the standard sigmoid tanh(x), 
      the VC dimension is between wk and w**4 k**2. },

      generalizes L-infinity stability. Both variants are equivalent to ISS 
      for linear systems. For general nonlinear systems, it is shown that 
      one of the new properties is strictly weaker than ISS, while the 
      other one is equivalent to it. For bilinear systems, a complete 
      characterization is provided of the weaker property. An interesting

   ABSTRACT     = { We showned in another recent paper that any 
      asymptotically controllable system can be stabilized by means of a 
      certain type of discontinuous feedback. The feedback laws constructed 
      in that work are robust with respect to actuator errors as well as to 
      perturbations of the system dynamics. A drawback, however, is that 
      they may be highly sensitive to errors in the measurement of the 
      state vector. This paper addresses this shortcoming, and shows how to 
      design a dynamic hybrid stabilizing controller which, while 
      preserving robustness to external perturbations and actuator error, 
      is also robust with respect to measurement error. This new design 
      relies upon a controller which incorporates an internal model of the 
      system driven by the previously constructed feedback. }

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper deals with (global) finite-gain input/output 
      stabilization of linear systems with saturated controls. For 
      neutrally stable systems, it is shown that the linear feedback law 
      suggested by the passivity approach indeed provides stability, with 
      respect to every Lp-norm. Explicit bounds on closed-loop gains are 
      obtained, and they are related to the norms for the respective 
      systems without saturation. These results do not extend to the class 
      of systems for which the state matrix has eigenvalues on the 
      imaginary axis with nonsimple (size >1) Jordan blocks, contradicting 
      what may be expected from the fact that such systems are globally 
      asymptotically stabilizable in the state-space sense; this is shown 
      in particular for the double integrator. },

      of functions giving rise to critical points of the quadratic loss

      a rough upper bound for this cardinality is provided as well. }

      replacing ad hoc conditions found in the literature by more

      Each processor updates its state by applying a "sigmoidal" function

      of all units. We prove that one may simulate all Turing Machines by 
      such nets. In particular, one can simulate any multi-stack Turing 
      Machine in real time, and there is a net made up of 886 processors 
      which computes a universal partial-recursive function. Products (high 
      order nets) are not required, contrary to what had been stated in the 
      literature. Non-deterministic Turing Machines can be simulated by 
      non-deterministic rational nets, also in real time. The simulation 
      result has many consequences regarding the decidability, or more 
      generally the complexity, of questions about recursive nets. },

      differential (or difference, in the discrete-time case) relations 
      between high-order derivatives (or shifts, respectively) of input and 
      output signals. It is shown that, under analyticity assumptions, 
      there cannot exist equations of order less than the minimal dimension 
      of any observable realization; this generalizes the known situation 
      in the classical linear case. The results depend on new facts, 
      themselves of considerable interest in control theory, regarding 
      universal inputs for observability in the discrete case, and 
      observation spaces in both the discrete and continuous cases. 
      Included in the paper is also a new and simple self-contained proof

   ABSTRACT     = { We suggest that a very natural mathematical framework 
      for the study of dissipation -in the sense of Willems, Moylan and 
      Hill, and others- is that of indefinite quasimetric spaces. Several 
      basic facts about dissipative systems are seen to be simple 
      consequences of the properties of such spaces. Quasimetric spaces 
      provide also one natural context for optimal control problems, and 
      even for "gap" formulations of robustness. }

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper deals with the computational complexity, and 
      in some cases undecidability, of several problems in nonlinear 
      control. The objective is to compare the theoretical difficulty of 
      solving such problems to the corresponding problems for linear 
      systems. In particular, the problem of null-controllability for 
      systems with saturations (of a "neural network" type) is mentioned, 
      as well as problems regarding piecewise linear (hybrid) systems. A 
      comparison of accessibility, which can be checked fairly simply by 
      Lie-algebraic methods, and controllability, which is at least NP-hard 
      for bilinear systems, is carried out. Finally, some remarks are given 
      on analog computation in this context. }

      in a manner very analogous to that of the linear case. Recall that 
      for the latter, observability is equivalent to the requirement that 
      there not be any nontrivial A-invariant subspace included in the 
      kernel of C. We show that the result generalizes in a natural manner,

      there are limits on their capabilities, though being more powerful 
      than Turing Machines. Moreover, there is a precise correspondence 
      between nets and standard non-uniform circuits with equivalent 
      resources, and as a consequence one has lower bound constraints on 
      what they can compute. We note that these networks are not likely to 
      solve polynomially NP-hard problems, as the equality "P=NP" in our 
      model implies the almost complete collapse of the standard polynomial 
      hierarchy. We show that a large class of different networks and 
      dynamical system models have no more computational power than this 
      neural (first-order) model with real weights. The results suggest the 
      following Church-like Thesis of Time-bounded Analog Computing: "Any

      systems is that of determining when, in analogy with the classical 
      continuous-time "positive form of Chow's Lemma", accessibility 
      follows from transitivity of a natural group action. This paper 
      studies the problem, and establishes the desired implication for 
      analytic systems in several cases: (i) compact state space, (ii) 
      under a Poisson stability condition, and (iii) in a generic sense. In 
      addition, the paper studies accessibility properties of the "control 
      sets" recently introduced in the context of dynamical systems 
      studies. Finally, various examples and counterexamples are provided 
      relating the various Lie algebras introduced in past work. },

      whose neurons all have the same nonlinear activation function s; if 
      the two nets have equal behaviors as "black boxes" then necessarily 
      they must have the same number of neurons and -except at most for 
      sign reversals at each node- the same weights. Moreover, even if the 
      activations are not a priori known to coincide, they are shown to be 
      also essentially determined from the external measurements. }

      of one hidden layer and two hidden layer nets consisting of 
      feedforward interconnections of linear threshold units. It is 
      remarked that for certain problems two hidden layers are required, 
      contrary to what might be in principle expected from the known 
      approximation theorems. The differences are not based on numerical 
      accuracy or number of units needed, nor on capabilities for feature 
      extraction, but rather on a much more basic classification into 
      "direct" and "inverse" problems. The former correspond to the 
      approximation of continuous functions, while the latter are concerned 
      with approximating one-sided inverses of continuous functions - and 
      are often encountered in the context of inverse kinematics 
      determination or in control questions. A general result is given 
      showing that nonlinear control systems can be stabilized using two 
      hidden layers, but not in general using just one. }

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper deals with single-hidden-layer feedforward 
      nets, studying various aspects of classification power and 
      interpolation capability. In particular, a worst-case analysis shows 
      that direct input to output connections in threshold nets double the 
      recognition but not the interpolation power, while using sigmoids 
      rather than thresholds allows doubling both. For other measures of 
      classification, including the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, the 
      effect of direct connections or sigmoidal activations is studied in 
      the special case of two-dimensional inputs. },

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper surveys recent work by the author on 
      learning and representational capabilities of feedforward nets. The 
      learning results show that, among two possible variants of the 
      so-called backpropagation training method for sigmoidal nets, both of 
      which variants are used in practice, one is a better generalization 
      of the older perceptron training algorithm than the other. The 
      representation results show that nets consisting of sigmoidal neurons 
      have at least twice the representational capabilities of nets that 
      use classical threshold neurons, at least when this increase is 
      quantified in terms of classification power. On the other hand, 
      threshold nets are shown to be more useful when approximating 
      implicit functions, as illustrated with an application to a typical 
      control problem. }

   ABSTRACT     = { Feedforward nets with sigmoidal activation functions 
      are often designed by minimizing a cost criterion. It has been 
      pointed out before that this technique may be outperformed by the 
      classical perceptron learning rule, at least on some problems. In 
      this paper, we show that no such pathologies can arise if the error 
      criterion is of a threshold LMS type, i.e., is zero for values 
      ``beyond'' the desired target values. More precisely, we show that if 
      the data are linearly separable, and one considers nets with no 
      hidden neurons, then an error function as above cannot have any local 
      minima that are not global. In addition, the proof gives the 
      following stronger result, under the stated hypotheses: the 
      continuous gradient adjustment procedure is such that from any 
      initial weight configuration a separating set of weights is obtained 
      in finite time. This is a precise analogue of the Perceptron Learning 
      Theorem. The results are then compared with the more classical 
      pattern recognition problem of threshold LMS with linear activations, 
      where no spurious local minima exist even for nonseparable data: here 
      it is shown that even if using the threshold criterion, such bad 
      local minima may occur, if the data are not separable and sigmoids 
      are used. keywords = { neural networks , feedforward neural nets }, },

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper shows how to extend recent results of 
      Colonius and Kliemann, regarding connections between chaos and 
      controllability, from continuous to discrete time. The extension is 
      nontrivial because the results all rely on basic properties of the 
      accessibility Lie algebra which fail to hold in discrete time. Thus, 
      this paper first develops further results in nonlinear accessibility, 
      and then shows how a theorem can be proved, which while analogous to 
      the one given in the work by Colonius and Klieman, also exhibits some 
      important differences. A counterexample is used to show that the 
      theorem given in continuous time cannot be generalized in a 
      straightforward manner. }

      for continuous time systems. It is shown that the discretized system 
      is linearizable by state coordinate change for an open set of 
      sampling times if and only if the continuous time system is 
      linearizable by state coordinate change. Also, it is shown that 
      linearizability via digital feedback imposes highly nongeneric 
      constraints on the structure of the plant, even if this is known to 
      be linearizable with continuous-time feedback. },

      exist for the input to state mapping of a continuous time nonlinear 
      system provided that the smooth feedback stabilization problem be 
      solvable for this system. In particular, it follows that feedback 
      linearizable systems admit such factorizations. In order to establish 
      the result a Lyapunov-theoretic definition is proposed for bounded 
      input bounded output stability. The main technical fact proved 
      relates the notion of stabilizability studied in the state space 
      nonlinear control literature to a notion of stability under bounded 
      control perturbations analogous to those studied in operator 
      theoretic approaches to systems; it states that smooth stabilization 
      implies smooth input-to-state stabilization. (Note: This is the 
      original ISS paper, but the ISS results have been much improved in 
      later papers. The material on coprime factorizations is still of 
      interest, but the 89 CDC paper has some improvements and should be

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper concerns itself with the existence of 
      open-loop control generators for nonlinear (continuous-time) systems. 
      The main result is that, under relatively mild assumptions on the 
      original system, and for each fixed compact subset of the state 
      space, there always exists one such generator. This is a new system 
      with the property that the controls it produces are sufficiently rich 
      to preserve complete controllability along nonsingular trajectories. 
      General results are also given on the continuity and 
      differentiability of the input to state mapping for various p-norms 
      on controls, as well as a comparison of various nonlinear 
      controllability notions. }

      conditional expectation as the estimate. We show that, at least in 
      principle, the "maximum iikelihood estimator" (MLE) proposed by Geman 
      and Geman lends itself to numerical computation using the annealing 
      algorithm. We argue that the MLE by itself can be, under certain 
      conditions (low signal to noise ratio), a very unsatisfactory 
      estimator, in that it does worse than just deciding that the signal 
      was zero. However, if combined with a rule which we propose, for 
      deciding when to use and when to ignore it, the MLE can provide a 
      reasonable suboptimal estimator. We then discuss preliminary 
      numerical data obtained using the annealing method. These results 
      indicate that: (a) the annealing algorithm performs remarkably well, 
      and (b) a criterion can be formulated in terms of quantities computed 
      from the observed image (without using a priori knowledge of the 
      signal-to-noise ratio) for deciding when to keep the MLE. }

      have this serniseparable covariance sequence property. In particular, 
      for a stationary random process, the spectral density function must

   ABSTRACT     = { This paper proposes an approach to the problem of 
      establishing the existence of observers for deterministic dynamical 
      systems. This approach differs from the standard one based on 
      Luenberger observers in that the observation error is not required to 
      be Markovian given the past input and output data. A general abstract 
      result is given, which special- izes to new results for parametrized 
      families of linear systems, delay systems and other classes of 
      systems. Related problems of feedback control and regulation are also 
      studied. }

      sense of control theory) defined by polynomial update equations. It 
      is based upon the premise that the natural tools for the study of the 
      structural-algebraic properties (in particular, realization theory) 
      of polynomial input/output maps are provided by algebraic geometry 
      and commutative algebra, perhaps as much as linear algebra provides 
      the natural tools for studying linear systems. Basic ideas from 
      algebraic geometry are used throughout in system-theoretic 
      applications (Hilbert's basis theorem to finite-time observability, 
      dimension theory to minimal realizations, Zariski's Main Theorem to 
      uniqueness of canonical realizations, etc). In order to keep the 
      level elementary (in particular, not utilizing sheaf-theoretic 
      concepts), certain ideas like nonaffine varieties are used only 
      implicitly (eg., quasi-affine as open sets in affine varieties) or in 
      technical parts of a few proofs, and the terminology is similarly 
      simplified (e.g., "polynomial map" instead of "scheme morphism 
      restricted to k-points", or "k-space" instead of "k-points of an 
      affine k-scheme"). }

      that for unambiguous sets the notion of rationality is independent of 
      the semiring over which representations are defined. The 
      undecidability of the rationality of probabilistic word functions is 
      also established. }
